{"clinical_note":"A healthy 11-year-old girl was presented to the National University of Malaysia (UKM) Paediatric Dental Clinic with a referral for further management of pulp necrosis of an immature lower right second premolar (tooth 45), secondary to the fractured tubercle of dens evaginatus. Two weeks earlier, she had treatment at a general dental clinic for pain related to tooth 45. Tooth 45 had spontaneous and lingering pain following cold and thermal stimuli. The tooth was diagnosed to have symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, and root canal therapy was initiated. The canal was accessed, and pulp extirpation performed before the placement of intracanal nonsetting calcium hydroxide by the general dental practitioner (GDP).\nAt the time of current assessment, her tooth-related symptoms had completely resolved. General oral examination showed the presence of generalised mild gingivitis with a basic periodontal examination (BPE) score of 1 in all sextants. The patient's oral hygiene was fair with a plaque score of 30%. The patient is still in her mixed dentition with the presence of the primary maxillary canines. Her upper dental arch was well aligned, and mild crowding of anterior teeth was noted in the lower arch. Tooth 45 has an occlusal glass ionomer dressing of the access cavity made for the pulp extirpation earlier by the GDP (). Cold and electric pulp sensibility testings showed positive responses to all fully erupted premolars indicative of tooth vitality expect for tooth 45. Tooth 45 also has slight tenderness to percussion. Periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an immature root with convergent open apex and small periapical radiolucency. The pulp space of tooth 45 is of an even width from the coronal to the apical portion (). Based on the assessments, tooth 45 was diagnosed with pulp necrosis secondary to fractured dens evaginatus and symptomatic apical periodontitis.\nOn the day of initial assessment, tooth 45 was isolated with rubber dam after infiltration of local anaesthetic solution (2% lidocaine with 1 : 80000 adrenaline). Pulp chamber was reentered through the previously prepared access cavity. The root canal was exposed and irrigated with saline. After that, the canal was dried with paper points and the tooth working length was estimated with a K-file No. 60. A working length, 2 mm short of the apical opening, was determined (17 mm). The canal was gently prepared with the K-file No. 60 and then irrigated with a copious volume of 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI). After drying the wet canal with paper points, nonsetting calcium hydroxide was placed into the canal and the access cavity was double sealed with Cavit\u2122 3M, USA, and glass ionomer cement (GIC) (Riva Self Cure\u2122 SDI, Australia).\nTwo weeks later, the tooth was reassessed for any signs and symptoms of infection. The tooth was no longer tender to percussion, and there was no indication of infection-related signs and symptoms. After isolation with a rubber dam, the root canal of tooth 45 was reaccessed and irrigated with a copious volume 1.5% NaOCl to remove the nonsetting calcium hydroxide. Then, the canal was irrigated with sterile water and dried with paper points. Subsequently, the canal was irrigated with 17% EDTA (Pulpdent\u2122, Watertown, Massachusetts) for a minute and dried with paper points. Finally, under the guidance of a dental operating microscope (Carl Zeiss Surgical GmbH, S100), the apical region was filled using the EndoSequence (BC RRM-Fast Set Putty, Brasseler, USA) material up to 4 mm thickness to create an apical seal (). The orifice of the root canal was double sealed with a cotton pellet, temporary filling material (Cavit 3M, USA), and GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia).\nOnce again, the root canal was reaccessed two weeks later, irrigated with 1.5% NaOCl, and dried with paper points. Next, the dried canal was obturated with thermoplasticised gutta-perca using the Obtura III Max System (Obtura Spartan\u00ae Endodontics) (). After that, the access cavity was double sealed with GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia) and nanohybrid composite (AURA\u2122 SDI, Australia), respectively.\nFollowing the obturation, tooth 45 was reviewed at three-month and six-month intervals. During both reviews, tooth 45 was asymptomatic. However, at the six-month review, a periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an unexpected finding. The apical root of tooth 45 continued to grow beyond the apexification level with a normal periodontal ligament space and lamina dura. No evidence of periapical radiolucency was noted (). However, regular annual monitoring of tooth 45 is essential to ensure that the coronal seal is intact and no apical complication further arises.","topic_list":"['the cause\/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']","keypoint_data":{"keypoint_data":{"retrieved_kp_score":57.6875,"retrieved_keypoints":"Level0: Pregnancy, Childbirth, & the PuerperiumLevel1: Abnormal Processes: Health and Health Maintenance, Screening, Diagnosis, Management, Risks, PrognosisLevel2: Newborn (birth to 4 weeks of age)Level3: disorders of the newborn: screening, newborn; ABO incompatibility in newborn; hemolytic disease due to Rh incompatibility; birth asphyxia syndrome (liveborn neonate); birth trauma (eg, cord compression, brachial palsy, lacerations); drug withdrawal syndrome in newborn; feeding problems in newborn; fetal growth and development abnormalities, including fetal growth restriction; gastrointestinal obstruction; hypocalcemia of newborn; infections, congenital or peripartum (cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses, HIV, hepatitis B, rubella virus, parvovirus B19 virus, varicella zoster virus, Chlamydia trachomatis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Treponema pallidum, Toxoplasma gondii); intrapartum fetal distress\/death including stillborn; jaundice, fetal\/neonatal\/perinatal; laryngomalacia; macrosomia (large for gestational age); meconium aspiration syndrome; neonatal acne; neonatal Candida infection (thrush); neonatal hypoglycemia; neonatal conjunctivitis and dacryocystitis; ophthalmic gonorrhea; phenylketonuria; premature infant; post- term infant; pseudomembranous colitis of infancy; respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease); respiratory problems after birth (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, tracheomalacia; tracheoesophageal fistula in neonates); retinitis of prematurity; seizures in newborn; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), apparent life-threatening event (ALTE); tetanus neonatorum | 612","keypoint_gpt4_output":"root canal therapy for pulp necrosis in pediatric patients"}},"status":"success"}
{"clinical_note":"A 42-year-old Cameroonian (black African) man with no relevant past medical history presented to our hospital with a 1-week history of fever and a 4-day history of no bowel movements. The fever was intermittent and worse in the evenings, and associated with headache, joint pains, and anorexia. He self-medicated an undocumented orally administered antimalarial medication but symptoms persisted. Three days later, he developed generalized abdominal pain, colicky in character, with a severity of 5\/10 on a visual analogue scale. This was associated with progressive abdominal distension and an altered bowel pattern initially characterized by an inability to pass stool and flatus over 4 days but he denied any vomiting. A worsening of his symptoms prompted his visit to our hospital.\nOn examination, his mucous membranes were dry, his conjunctivae were pink, and his vital signs were normal. His abdomen was mildly distended with mild diffuse tenderness. There was neither guarding nor rebound tenderness. Percussion note was tympanic and bowel sounds were hyperactive. His rectum was empty per digital rectal examination and his prostate was not enlarged. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nA rapid diagnostic (Alere\u2122 Malaria Ag P.f, Abbott Rapid Diagnostics, USA) test for malaria was positive. Also, his complete blood count values were within normal ranges: white blood cell count of 6200 cells\/uL, hemoglobin of 12.5 g\/dL, and platelet count of 222,000 cells\/uL. His metabolic panel was within normal range: serum sodium ion (Na+) of 140 mmol\/L, serum potassium ion (K+) of 4.0 mmol\/L, serum chloride ion (Cl\u2212) of 98 mmol\/L, serum creatinine of 0.9 mg\/dL, alanine aminotransferase was 41.2 U\/L, aspartate aminotransferase was 33.0 U\/L, total bilirubin was 0.81 mg\/dL, and alkaline phosphatase was 55.9 U\/L. His human immunodeficiency virus serology was non-reactive. His rapid antibody test for typhoid fever was also non-reactive. There was no significant air fluid level or increased bowel gas on a plain abdominal radiograph and an abdominal ultrasound revealed mild free intra-abdominal fluid in all four quadrants.\nWe concluded on a working diagnosis of functional bowel obstruction secondary to malaria. He received three doses of intravenously administered quinine base infusion (600 mg in 500 ml of dextrose 5% to flow for 4 hours every 8 hours for 24 hours) and intravenously administered crystalloids (0.9% normal saline at rate of 1 liter 8 hourly for 48 hours) and was placed on \u201cnothing by mouth.\u201d He passed a small quantity of feces 48 hours after initiation of antimalarial medication, with complete resolution of the abdominal pain, distension, and bowel movements on the fourth day of hospital stay. A stool examination was done with no organisms identified. We then concluded on a final diagnosis of sub-acute intestinal obstruction secondary to malaria. He was then discharged on an orally administered artemisinin-based antimalarial combination (artemether\/lumefantrine 20\/120 mg, 4 tablets 12 hourly for 3 days). His 2-week follow up was unremarkable.","topic_list":"['the cause\/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs\/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']","keypoint_data":{"keypoint_data":{"retrieved_kp_score":57.53125,"retrieved_keypoints":"Level0: Multisystem Processes & DisordersLevel1: Abnormal Processes: Health and Health Maintenance, Screening, Diagnosis, Management, Risks, PrognosisLevel2: Signs, symptoms, and ill-defined disorders: arthralgias; abdominal pain; chest pain; cough; dizziness, light-headedness, syncope, including breath-holding spells with syncope; dyspnea, shortness of breath; edema, anasarca; fatigue; fever of unknown origin; hemoptysis; pain management (in a nonaddiction, nonpalliative-care setting); joint pain; lymphedema; palpitations; pruritus; unexpected weight gain\/weight loss | 480","keypoint_gpt4_output":"Artemisinin-based antimalarial therapy"}},"status":"success"}
{"clinical_note":"The patient was a 65-year-old man with a prior history of repeated plastic surgery for scar contracture of the hands and fingers, ablation surgery for idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, and diabetes. There was no family history of no consanguineous marriage or EB.\nHe had experienced recurrent blistering of the skin that was readily caused by an external force since the time shortly after birth, which had been treated symptomatically. He was diagnosed with EB during a genetic consultation that he had received before getting married at the age of 28 years. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with RDEB at the age of 38 years. Application of a strong external force to the skin results in blister formation as early as 15 min. In June 2012, he presented to a nearby hospital with epigastric pain, where he was diagnosed with cholelithiasis and cancer in the transverse colon and was referred to our hospital. In September 2012, transverse colectomy and cholecystectomy were performed via laparotomy, followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In April 2013, a liver metastasis (S2) was detected. The lesion was a solitary tumor measuring \u22642 cm and was treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in June 2013, again followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In September 2015, a recurrent tumor was detected at the site of RFA, with suspected invasion into the diaphragm. He was then admitted to our hospital for curative open surgery. On admission, although no active blistering was noted, pigmentation and scars due to recurrent blistering were noted especially in the extremities and back. Most fingers in both hands were club-shaped, with a few intact fingers. Blood test showed a mild increase in glucose to 123 mg\/dl and increases in tumor markers, including mean levels of CEA and CA19-9 of 25.0 (0\u20135) ng\/ml and 62.1 (0\u201337) U\/ml, respectively.\nAbdominal CT\/MRI revealed a 3.5 cm metastatic liver carcinoma with diaphragmatic invasion in the lateral segment of the liver. In January 8, 2016, open partial hepatectomy of the lateral segment with combined diaphragmatic resection was performed.\nThe patient was asked to climb on the operating table on his own to minimize application of an external force to the skin. Epidural anesthesia was achieved by just one injection of 5 ml of 0.5% procaine into the epidural space. For endotracheal intubation, due to a difficulty in manually fixing a mask and lifting the lower jaw, the patient was asked to open his mouth and intubation was performed while the patient was conscious using intravenous injection of 1% propofol and intratracheal spraying of 1% xylocaine, under bronchoscopic guidance using a McGRATH\u2122 MAC video laryngoscope (Covidien). Isodine disinfectant was used for skin disinfection of the surgical site, as the patient was tolerant of chemical stimulations. A skin incision was made sharply with a scalpel, with particular care taken to avoid contact of a steel instrument with the skin. Partial hepatectomy of the lateral segment with combined diaphragmatic resection was performed. The diaphragmatic defect was closed with a 2-0 nonabsorbable suture while the lung was compressed, without chest tube placement. A 19 Fr closed low-pressure continuous-suction drain was placed on the liver resection surface. A block catheter was also placed on the bilateral rectus sheaths in case of postoperative wound pain. The wound was closed by two-layer suturing with a 0 monofilament absorbable suture for the peritoneal muscle layer and a 4-0 monofilament absorbable suture for dermal closure. The wound was covered with a Mepilex\u00ae Border Ag dressing (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care). The drain was fixed with a needle and a suture and then with a Mepitac\u00ae tape (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care). The operative and anesthetic times were 346 and 457 min, respectively.\nThe patient was discharged from the hospital on day 9. He had an uneventful postoperative course with no abnormality of the wound in postoperative outpatient examination.","topic_list":"['the cause\/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']","keypoint_data":{"keypoint_data":{"retrieved_kp_score":58.125,"retrieved_keypoints":"Level0: Pregnancy, Childbirth, & the PuerperiumLevel1: Abnormal Processes: Health and Health Maintenance, Screening, Diagnosis, Management, Risks, PrognosisLevel2: Newborn (birth to 4 weeks of age)Level3: disorders of the newborn: screening, newborn; ABO incompatibility in newborn; hemolytic disease due to Rh incompatibility; birth asphyxia syndrome (liveborn neonate); birth trauma (eg, cord compression, brachial palsy, lacerations); drug withdrawal syndrome in newborn; feeding problems in newborn; fetal growth and development abnormalities, including fetal growth restriction; gastrointestinal obstruction; hypocalcemia of newborn; infections, congenital or peripartum (cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses, HIV, hepatitis B, rubella virus, parvovirus B19 virus, varicella zoster virus, Chlamydia trachomatis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Treponema pallidum, Toxoplasma gondii); intrapartum fetal distress\/death including stillborn; jaundice, fetal\/neonatal\/perinatal; laryngomalacia; macrosomia (large for gestational age); meconium aspiration syndrome; neonatal acne; neonatal Candida infection (thrush); neonatal hypoglycemia; neonatal conjunctivitis and dacryocystitis; ophthalmic gonorrhea; phenylketonuria; premature infant; post- term infant; pseudomembranous colitis of infancy; respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease); respiratory problems after birth (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, tracheomalacia; tracheoesophageal fistula in neonates); retinitis of prematurity; seizures in newborn; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), apparent life-threatening event (ALTE); tetanus neonatorum | 612","keypoint_gpt4_output":"epidermolysis bullosa management"}},"status":"success"}

{"clinical_note":"A 25-year-old female with no prior medical history presented to the emergency department due to high fever (up to 39\u00b0C) since 3 days. She complained of left flank pain and gross hematuria. On physical examination, left costovertebral angle tenderness was noted. The urinalysis confirmed the hematuria (2055 red blood cells per high-power field). The urinary dipstick was negative for leukocyte esterase and for nitrites, but significantly positive for albuminuria (2+). On microscopic examination of the urine, pyuria was minimal (6 white blood cells per high-power field) and no bacteriuria was noted. She denied having taken antibiotics before presentation. Urine and blood cultures were obtained. The laboratory tests revealed a significantly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP = 28 mg\/dl), a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (107 mm\/h), and an elevated creatinine (1.21 mg\/dl) with normal blood urea nitrogen (16 mg\/dl).\nShe was admitted to the internal medicine ward with a preliminary diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, and she was started on intravenous ceftriaxone. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography the next day revealed a hypoenhancing region in the upper pole of the left kidney, suggestive of pyelonephritis (). However, considering the significant hematuria in the absence of pyuria and bacteriuria, and the persistently elevated creatinine (1.55 mg\/dl on day 3), a nephrologist was consulted. Microscopic evaluation of the urinary sediment revealed dysmorphic red blood cells suggesting glomerular disease (2 red blood cell casts and 60\u201380 red blood cells per high-power field with >10% of G1 cells and >80% dysmorphic erythrocytes). The spot urine protein to creatinine ratio obtained on the 5th day of hospital stay was also elevated (929 mg\/g). Furthermore, both urine and blood cultures came back negative, and no fever was recorded during the hospital stay.

{"clinical_note":"A 45-year-old woman was admitted to an emergency department with dyspnea and swelling on her hands and face for at least three days. She was nonsmoker and did not have any chronic disease. Her dyspnea and hypoxemia were getting worse and she was accepted to ICU. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (MV) was used for initial treatment but hypoxemia was worsened; hence, she was intubated and invasive MV was used. On her physical examination, we auscultated mild crackles bilateral on lower lung zones. Her chest X-ray showed bilateral nonhomogenous infiltration at middle and lower zones (). While initial fraction of inhaled oxygenation (FiO2) was 80% on MV, her PaO2 was 65 mmHg and lung protective MV strategies were applied. An appropriate fluid replacement, antibiotics, and other medical treatments were applied. Undergoing MV, FiO2 level was decreased gradually and she was weaned from MV on her fifth day of ICU stay and MV. After weaning, we observed that her oral secretions increased and her left nasolabial sulcus wiped out. On her neurological examination, abnormal findings were not found except left facial paralysis. We did not study out any pathological imagination neither on her cranial computed tomography (CT) nor on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) was diagnosed and intravenous steroid treatment 1 milligram per kilogram (methylprednisolone) was added to her therapy by neurologist. At the same time, dermatological lesion occurred and, on her dermatologic examination, oedema on her face, pustular lesions on her skin, and fissure on her tongue were detected; therefore labium mucosal biopsy was taken and mucositis was reported ().

{"clinical_note":"An 80-year-old man with progressive pain lasting for 5 days and with focal swelling of the left foot was referred to the radiology department. Wearing shoes aggravated the pain. Inspection of his footwear showed a bump at the inner sole, corresponding with the location of the clinical abnormality at the heel of the patient. Clinically, there was suspicion of plantar fasciitis.\nPlain films showed the absence of inferior calcaneal spur formation. Ultrasound revealed a normal plantar fascia. Medially from the plantar fasciitis, adjacent to the course of the medial plantar artery, hypoechoic tubular structures were seen, which were not compressible. There was no intralesional flow on color Doppler imaging (Figure ). Comparison with the right foot showed normal compressible veins. Subsequent MRI confirmed thrombosis of the medial plantar veins (Figure ).\nThe symptoms disappeared after conservative therapy with change of footwear and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

{"clinical_note":"The patient was a healthy 25-year-old man with a one-year history of right ankle pain following trauma.\nHe had met a car accident while walking. One year earlier, he had undergone open reduction and internal fixation on his right ankle for fracture at another hospital. A tibia diaphysis spiral fracture was fixed by the anterograde intramedullary nail with infra-patellar approach. An ankle malleolar fracture was fixed by the locking plate and cannulated cancellous screws with direct lateral and medial approach. He had finally consulted us because of worsening ankle pain while walking. On physical examination, there was tenderness in the anteromedial joint space of the right ankle. Slight ankle swelling was noted. Dorsiflexion of the right ankle was 10\u00b0, similar to that of the left ankle, but plantarflexion was restricted to 38\u00b0, compared with 60\u00b0 on the left, but the ankle instability test was negative.\nThe first three months, even though we performed intra-articular injections, arthroscopic synovectomy for osteoarthritis, and the fixation implant removal in order to release implant irritation, his ankle pain persisted.\nThe AOFAS ankle score at that point in time was 50 . Radiographs showed moderate narrowing of the ankle joint and forward displacement of the talus (-A, B). Computed tomography of the right ankle showed an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond (). This was diagnosed as progressive osteoarthritis caused by an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond, and surgical repair of the osteochondral defect was recommended. Three months later, the osteochondral graft was performed on the patient's right ankle. The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia. The lower extremity was prepared and draped in the standard sterile fashion. We inserted the 2.0 mm K-wire in his right calcaneus, then skeletal traction was done in order to open his right ankle joint space if necessary. Next, 10 mL of fluid was injected intra-articularly to distend the ankle. The anterolateral ankle arthroscopy portal was established in the routine fashion, and global arthroscopy was performed. The osteochondral defect was identified about the anterolateral plafond which site was enthesis of the anterior tibiofibular ligament (), and osteochondral lesions of the tibia and talus were identified. An anteromedial portal was established. The osteochondral lesions were probed, and the osteochondral lesions were diagnosed as grade 2 according to the classification of the International Cartilage Repair Society . We performed multiple OAT in the anterolateral plafond at the anterolateral wall with extension of the anterolateral portal. The anterolateral osteochondral defect was measured 9 mm \u00d7 20 mm (). The plug donor site was the lateral corner of the patellar groove in the right knee joint. Under direct vision, we harvested 2 bone plugs from the normal bone deeper than the osteochondral defect for the preparation of the recipient site in order to accept the osteochondral plugs from the donor site in maximum plantarflexion. Then, the dilator was interpositioned into the recipient site, and a radiograph was taken to calculate the inclination angle between the dilator and tibial plafond. Therefore, we thought that the smooth surface was obtained by the inclination of the grafted plugs. According to the angle required, two 8-mm osteochondral autograft plugs ramped 35\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 were harvested from the donor site (), and transferred into the anterolateral plafond at an angle to re-contour the articular surface and make it smooth. Both harvest and transplantation of osteochondral autograft plugs were performed by open approaches for transplantation in the exact slope. After this procedure, the surface of the anterolateral wall of plafond was almost completely smooth (). The depth of these plugs was 20 mm, deeper than the osteochondral defect. It was confirmed that the deepest area of the plugs consisted of a macroscopically normal bone. We used press-fit technique in order to stabilize the osteochondral plugs. Stabilization of the osteochondral fragments relied on tight interference with the host bone. In case of difficulty with press-fit technique, a screw made of polylactic acid and hydroxyapatite was prepared, but it was never used.\nPostoperatively, the foot was placed in a short leg cast, and the patient was advised to ambulate non-weightbearing for a 4-week period. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and a range of motion exercises were initiated immediately after cast removal at 4 weeks, with partial progressive weightbearing allowed during the next 4 weeks. The patient was able to return to standing work 10 months after surgery. The most recent magnetic resonance imaging scans at 2 years after surgery showed that the cartilage in the anterolateral joint surface was almost intact, and there was no osteonecrosis (). At 3 years the post-operative X-rays of the ankle joint depicted a larger osteophyte, compared with the pre-operative situation, in the anterolateral corner of the right tibial plafond. No forward displacement of the talus was evident on the lateral view of the right ankle joint, while the respective joint space was preserved (). On the latest physical examination, the patient complained of mild pain in his right ankle while walking, but could walk for 30 min. Dorsiflexion of the right ankle was 0\u00b0, compared with 10\u00b0 on the left, and plantarflexion was 30\u00b0, compared with 60\u00b0 on the left. The postoperative AOFAS ankle score was 80. The patient remained asymptomatic with respect to the donor sites of the right knee. He was able to return to carpenter's work on a five-day week, but remained with minor ankle pain on standing up and walking for more than half an hour over the 3-year observation period.","topic_list":"['the cause\/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions', 'appropriate surgical management']","keypoint_data":{"keypoint_data":{"retrieved_kp_score":54.09375,"retrieved_keypoints":"Level0: Musculoskeletal SystemLevel1: Abnormal Processes: Health and Health Maintenance, Screening, Diagnosis, Management, Risks, PrognosisLevel2: Traumatic and mechanical disorders: amputation and care of amputees; backache, including low back pain; blast injuries; compartment syndrome; contractures, hospital-acquired; contusions; dislocations; fractures; sprains, strains; kyphoscoliosis, scoliosis; rotator cuff syndrome; slipped capital femoral epiphysis; dislocation of hip | 684","keypoint_gpt4_output":"Osteochondral autograft transplantation surgery (OATS)"}},"status":"success"}
