{"clinical_note": "A two-year-old female, previously healthy and normally developing, presented with a six-week history of macrocephaly and truncal and peripheral ataxia. An eye examination showed a lack of papilledema but was suspicious for mild peripheral loss of vision. Her past medical history was unremarkable. She did not have diencephalic syndrome at presentation. An urgent brain MRI demonstrated the presence of a large lobulated multicompartmental supra-sellar mass centered within the hypothalamus/optic chiasm (5.4cm x 3.4cm x 5cm) (Figure ), with extension into the surrounding structures and mass effect on the midbrain and third ventricle causing obstructive hydrocephalus. She initially underwent an endoscopic biopsy and septostomy, along with a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt to manage her hydrocephalus. The pathology of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of a low-grade glioma (LGG) that was BRAF-V600E negative on immunohistochemistry but positive on next-generation sequencing (Figure ). She was started on chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin, but unfortunately she had rapid tumor progression with worsening hydrocephalus six weeks into chemotherapy. This progression caused the patient to develop further complications, including progressive right-sided hemiparesis, bitemporal hemianopia, central hypothyroidism, and feeding difficulties requiring a gastrostomy tube and placement of a second VP shunt. After extensive discussions and mutual expert consensus, her chemotherapy was stopped, and she was started on the novel targeted agent dabrafenib (5.25mg/kg/day). By three months of starting dabrafenib, the size of her tumor decreased by more than 70% (2.5cm x 3.5cm x 2.7cm), with continued decline until plateauing after two years of therapy (Figure ). Prior to dabrafenib, the patient had marked motor and speech impairments but is now able to perform all age-appropriate developmental skills independently. She no longer requires tube feeding and has been growing well. Her bitemporal hemianopia has improved markedly. Her visual acuity is the only symptom that has not shown significant recovery, as she continues to have low but stable visual acuity bilaterally. Our patient is currently five years old, has been on dabrafenib for 30 months, and, to date, she has not experienced any side effects while on targeted therapy. Our plan is to continue on dabrafenib as long as the patient is tolerating the therapy well with no recurrence or progression of the tumor.\nConsent was obtained from the parents for sharing of the clinical information and participation in the ORCYD (Oncology Repository for Children and Young Adults) biomarker study. Samples (both blood and CSF) were collected every three months after starting targeted therapy with dabrafenib. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from CSF and plasma isolated from blood collected in DNA BCT tubes (Streck, La Vista, NE) were extracted using the QIAamp\u00ae Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Samples were quantified with Qubit\u2122 and the 1X dsDNA high sensitivity (HS) kit (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA); 1-ul aliquots were loaded on HS DNA chips and run on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) to check for cfDNA profile. Samples were pre-amplified with the SsoAdvance\u2122 PreAmp Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for 10 cycles (annealing temperature = 58\u00b0C) following manufacturer's instructions. Diluted pre-amplified samples were mixed with 2X droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) probe mix then used to generate droplets on a QX200 DG (Bio-Rad). Droplets were then submitted to PCR amplification: 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes, 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 56\u00b0C for 1 minute (45 cycles), and 98\u00b0C for 10 minutes.

He was otherwise hemodynamically stable, with unremarkable laboratory studies and a negative urine drug screen. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast showed a large right frontoparietal lesion crossing midline with surrounding vasogenic edema (Figure ). Further characterization with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 5.5-cm intra-axial mass within the deep white matter of the right frontal lobe, with gadolinium enhancement and prominent FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) signal concerning malignancy.\nLater, the patient was started on dexamethasone, and a frontal stereotactic brain biopsy was performed. The initial pathology report showed a B-cell lymphoma with cells positive for CD20 immunostain (Figures -). However, due to its complexity, the sample was sent to an outside institution for a second opinion, which found the sample to be positive for the MYD88L265P mutation. Due to the strong association between this mutation and WM, quantitative serum immunoglobulins were measured, which showed an elevated IgM monoclonal paraprotein, confirming the diagnosis of WM.\nThe patient was started on treatment with rituximab, methylprednisolone, carfilzomib, and ibrutinib. The patient showed a good response by MRI at three months, and he was transitioned to oral ibrutinib only. Surveillance MRI at one year post-diagnosis showed patchy right frontal lobe enhancement indicating disease progression, although the patient had no clinical symptoms; he was then restarted on the initial chemo-immunotherapy protocol. However, ibrutinib was later held due to thrombocytopenia. Soon after, the patient presented to the hospital again with cognitive dysfunction, leg weakness, and falls, with MRI showing significant disease progression. At this point, his treatment was changed to palliative chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate and rituximab.

The patient had recently undergone multiple left knee revisions and received several antibiotics in an attempt to treat the draining chronic left knee infection (Table ).\nHe developed severe allergic reactions (urticarial rashes and angioedema) to cephalexin and ciprofloxacin trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Subsequently, 11 days prior to presentation, he was started on ertapenem and daptomycin. Moreover, before intravenous daptomycin and ertapenem were started, he had not received additional antibiotics for over a month. The patient had no previous history of pulmonary diseases and he denied any exposure to pulmonary irritants. Upon admission, the patient had a Hickman catheter for long-term antibiotic use without signs of acute inflammation. He had wheezing throughout the bilateral lung fields but no crackles. A draining tract with serosanguinous fluid drainage was observed on his left knee. His physical exam was otherwise unremarkable. The initial laboratory work demonstrated moderate anemia, normal white blood cells but with bandemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (Table ).\nA chest x-ray showed new diffuse interstitial opacities (Figure ). A single anteroposterior portable chest X-ray was obtained on admission. Compared to a chest X-ray nine months prior, there were new diffuse branching interstitial opacities extending outward from hila associated with additional circular interstitial opacities. These were likely representing peribronchovascular interstitial thickening. There may be a trace of left pleural effusion without right pleural effusion. Additionally, the aorta was atherosclerotic and a right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction was seen in situ.\nOn the second day of admission, the patient started having worsening shortness of breath, desaturation, tachycardia, and persistent fever. Examination of the lungs revealed bilateral crackles while the lower limbs and the trunk showed a new reticulopapular, non-pruritic rash.

{"clinical_note": "An 88-year-old woman (height, 150 cm; weight, 41 kg) with no history of drug allergy or general anesthesia was scheduled for transfemoral TAVI because of severe aortic stenosis (AS). The surgery was performed under general anesthesia to facilitate the use of transesophageal echocardiography and to manage any intraoperative complications. She was taking 0.625 mg/day bisoprolol, a selective \u03b2-1 blocker, for hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation. Additionally, she was taking amlodipine for hypertension. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed severe AS (aortic valve peak flow velocity: 4.73 m/s; mean aortic valve pressure gradient: 47 mmHg; aortic valve area: 0.41 cm2) and myocardial hypertrophy (left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular septum thickness: 14 mm).\nPre-anesthetic medication for sedation was not administered. She received bisoprolol and amlodipine 3 h before entering the operating room. Figure shows the anesthesia record. General anesthesia was induced using midazolam and remifentanil; additionally, rocuronium was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. She received total intravenous anesthesia: continuous infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Noradrenaline and dopamine were infused continuously through the central venous catheter to maintain blood pressure. AS disappeared after valve implantation. During the surgery, complete atrioventricular block occurred, and ventricular pacing (VVI mode: 60 ppm) was initiated. No other complications were associated with the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, she received 100 mg sugammadex through the central venous catheter, but 2 min later, her systolic arterial blood pressure (ABP) decreased unexpectedly to less than 40 mmHg. Simultaneously, ventilator monitoring revealed elevated peak and plateau airway pressures (60 and 40 cmH2O, respectively). No skin rash was observed on the body surface. Transthoracic echocardiography showed underfilling of the left ventricle without right ventricular dilatation or pericardial effusion. No abnormalities were observed in left ventricular wall motion.\nThe patient developed distributive shock, which was clinically diagnosed as anaphylactic shock caused by sugammadex because of the rapid onset of severe hypotension and bronchospasm. First, two boluses of 0.05 mg adrenaline were administered through the central venous catheter, followed by rapid volume resuscitation using crystalloid (1 L infusion within 30 min). The dose of noradrenaline was increased to 0.3 \u03bcg/kg/min. Consequently, the airway pressures returned to the original level, but the hypotension persisted. Thereafter, adrenaline was administered via bolus (0.1 mg twice) and continuous infusion (0.1 \u03bcg/kg/min); however, the increase in her ABP was minimal. Therefore, 1 mg glucagon was administered intravenously, and her systolic ABP immediately rose to 130 mmHg. An erythematous rash also appeared on her neck with the increase in ABP. Her general condition was stable after the therapeutic interventions. Ventricular pacing was continued because bradycardia with complete atrioventricular block was persistent during the interventions. She was admitted to the intensive care unit under tracheal intubation. Subsequently, the continuous infusion of adrenaline was discontinued, and the continuous infusion of noradrenaline was reduced. We also administered 125 mg methylprednisolone for 3 days. She was extubated 9 h after the onset of anaphylaxis, and circulatory agonists were discontinued the following day. She was discharged without complications on postoperative day 9. Blood tests revealed a total serum tryptase level of 7.3 ng/mL and 1.2 ng/mL at 1 h and 24 h after onset, respectively. We advised the patient to undergo allergy tests, such as skin prick tests or intradermal tests, to identify the cause of anaphylaxis. However, the patient refused these tests because she was elderly and unlikely to undergo surgery under general anesthesia in the future.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.

He had no medical history. His lifestyle has included 1500 ml beer consumption per day and 40 cigarettes per day for the past 40 years. Computed tomography (CT) showed thickening of the wall in the lower esophagus as the primary lesion was demonstrated and the tumor formed a mass with the solitary metastatic abdominal lymph node, and invaded pancreas body and gastric body (Fig. ). No other distant metastasis was detected on CT. He was diagnosed with lower esophageal cancer cT4 N1 M0, with pancreatic invasion, cStage IIIC according to 7th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control system []. At first, we considered definitive chemoradiotherapy. However, radiation oncologists evaluated that the tumor was less candidate for chemoradiotherapy because of the risk of gastric mucosal damage. For the purpose of definitive therapy, radical esophagectomy with distal pancreatectomy was planned. As neoadjuvant chemotherapy, CF therapy (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil therapy; cisplatin was dripped 80 mg/m2 plus 5-fluorouracil was infused 800 mg/m2 on day 1 through 4 continuously) was started according to standard therapy of localized advanced esophageal cancer []. However, after once administration, he could not continue chemotherapy for the exacerbation of dysphagia, and underwent radical surgery. Preoperative evaluation of tumor was similar to initial findings on endoscopy and CT.\nIn findings on laparotomy, abdominal lymph node was infiltrated directly to pancreas body. As the radical surgery, Ivor Lewis esophagectomy with distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, followed by reconstruction of gastric conduit. Two fields lymphadenectomy was performed according to the treatment strategy of the abdominal esophageal cancer. Reconstruction of gastric conduit was possible although the lymph node was adherent to lesser side of gastric body, which was resected when reconstruction of gastric conduit. In addition, partial resection of lung was performed simultaneously owing to involvement of bilateral pulmonary ligaments to the primary tumor (Fig. ). The operative time was 528 min. The estimated blood loss was 2850 ml, and the patient was transfused 4 units of red blood cell concentrates.\nThe patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was able to take orally. He was discharged 16 days after operation with tube-free. After discharge, he underwent two courses of CF therapy as adjuvant chemotherapy. At present, he is still alive and has no recurrence for 7 years after surgery.\nIn the resected specimen, the primary lesion was observed from lower esophagus to esophagogastric junction, and metastatic lymph node was fixed to stomach and pancreas body (Fig. ). Pathological examination revealed that primary lesion was not infiltrated to lung (Fig. a, b). Massive metastatic lymph node (over 5cm) was observed in the lesser curvature of stomach, and infiltrated to pancreas and gastric wall with extranodal extension (Fig. c, d). The tumor was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated type. The vascular and lymphatic invasion was confirmed. The surgical margin was negative. The pathological stage was ypT4 N1 (1/61) M0 (metastatic lymph node invasion into pancreas), ypStage IIIC.

Axial length was 29.0 mm in the right and 28.7 mm in the left eyes, respectively; refractive errors were \u221211.5 and \u221210.5 diopter; best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/28 and 20/16, respectively. The BCVA was described by converting the decimal visual acuity into fractional visual acuity. Mild cataract was observed in both eyes. Fundoscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images showed epiretinal membrane (ERM) in the left eye (Fig. ).\nThree years later, she developed blurred vision and BCVA in the left eye decreased to 20/33; OCT revealed thickening of the ERM. The patient opted for vitrectomy after thorough discussion and considering recent reports showing good treatment outcome for ERM with good visual acuity []. The patient subsequently underwent uncomplicated 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with ERM and internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in the left eye. After 6 months, BCVA was 20/28. CRA was noted in the parafovea, and OCT revealed irregularities in the RPE with increased transmission signal from the sclera, suggesting atrophy of the RPE (Fig. ).\nAfter another 3 weeks, BCVA in the left eye decreased suddenly from 20/28 to 20/100. OCT demonstrated disruption of the interdigitation and ellipsoid zones and elevation of the RPE. Choroidal thickness at this site increased from 134 \u00b5m to 151 \u00b5m (Fig. a, b). Fluorescein angiography (FA) revealed hyperfluorescence (Fig. a), which coincided with the site where changes were observed in RPE and choroid on OCT (Fig. b). Hyperfluorescence was observed from an early stage, but no leak thereafter. Typical choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or lacquer crack were not shown on FA. Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) did not detect abnormal blood vessels suggesting CNV (Fig. b). Although fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography did not show typical CNV or lacquer crack, myopic CNV could not be ruled out. Therefore, intravitreal ranibizumab injection was recommended. However, 2 days after the injection, the patient presented with a further decline in vision to 20/222 in her left eye. Despite no obvious change on fundus examination, OCT revealed a nodule-like outer retinal lesion with disruption of the RPE, suggesting PIC. Choroidal thickness had decreased slightly to 142 \u03bcm (Fig. c). Careful observation was recommended after thorough discussion with the patient concerning possible treatment options, including steroid therapy.\nOne month after the injection, BCVA improved to 20/100 and the nodule-like lesion regressed, leaving an expanded RPE defect with a decrease in choroidal thickness to 84 \u03bcm. The lesion was judged to be inactive, and further observation was recommended. However, the area of CRA increased gradually to 0.38, 0.90, and 1.59 mm2 and choroidal thickness decreased to 52, 40, and 16 \u03bcm by 14, 30, and 40 months post-injection, respectively (Fig. ). CRA progressed at a rate of 0.45 mm2/year. The CRA was measured on color photographs of the fundus using ImageJ software (freely available at ).

{"clinical_note": "An 82-year-old male patient with angina on anticoagulant medication and without viral infection was referred to our department for the surgical treatment of HCC. His personal and family medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a huge HCC mass in segment 4 and PVTT invasion from the nearby portal vein to the left portal trunk, main portal trunk, through to the contralateral right portal trunk. The tip of the PVTT progressed over to the bifurcation of the anterior and posterior branches of the portal trunk. The anterior branch was filled with PVTT, while the posterior branch was filled with PVTT or blood thrombus (Fig. ). No apparent intra- and extra-hepatic metastases were detected other than the main tumor. Laboratory data showed a serum albumin level of 3.8 g/dL, total bilirubin level of 0.5 mg/dL, platelet count of 13.9 \u00d7 104/uL, and a Child-Pugh score of 6. Serum levels of alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II were 90,770 ng/mL and 2847 mAU/mL, respectively. An antithrombotic drug was administered for the PVTT. Due to the overwhelming PVTT extensions, poor performance status, and old age, the patient was deemed not to have a surgical indication. Therefore, a combination treatment using atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with radiotherapy for PVTT was selected. During preparation for radiotherapy, one-time atezolizumab (1200 mg) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) were administered. He developed anal pain and persistent fever 9 days after administration, and CT showed perianal abscess due to anal fistula. Although he recovered soon after percutaneous abscess drainage, this adverse event interrupted atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment, and radiotherapy could not be introduced. Abdominal CT, conducted 3 weeks after the first administration, showed size reduction of the main tumor and PVTT, with a reduction in tumor enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT. Serum AFP decreased from 90,700 ng/mL before treatment to 18,371 ng/mL and 6301 ng/mL 3 and 5 weeks after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment, respectively. Considering the excellent response to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment (one-time administration), we decided to continue with this treatment after creating colostomy. Colostomy was performed 47 days after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Subsequently, beginning from the 83rd day after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, atezolizumab monotherapy was initiated. The reason for choosing atezolizumab monotherapy was that the bleeding from the colostomy persists from the collateral blood circulation due to the liver cirrhosis. The serum AFP decreased to 89 ng/mL just before the next atezolizumab monotherapy, and abdominal CT showed continued partial response (Fig. ); serum AFP levels kept decreasing toward the normal range (Fig. ).

White light endoscopy (WLE) revealed a 22 mm flat lesion in the middle esophagus.The lesion was covered with scattered leukoplakia, and normal vascular network could not be seen in the lesion (Fig. a). Narrow-band imaging (NBI) under endoscopy revealed the lesion with an indistinct brownish area, local white penniform area, and white tiny papillary surface structure (Fig. b). Further low and high magnifying endoscopy with NBI (ME-NBI) showed tiny irregular papillary microsurface structure with various shapes and sizes, and non-typical type B1 pattern of intraepithelial papillary capillary loops (IPCL) confined to the papillary microsurface structure (Fig. c, low magnification, and Fig. d, high magnification) according to the classification of Japan Esophagus Society (JES classification) [].

{"clinical_note": "A previously healthy 25-year-old White man presented with a 1-year history of blurred vision in the right eye, headache, and weight loss of about 30 kg. On physical examination, he had a body mass index of 28 kg/m2 and visual field defects in the right eye. Initial MRI showed a lightly spotted heterogeneous 19 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 19 mm tumor located suprasellarly, close to the pituitary gland with no ingrowth or association with the pituitary gland (Fig. A). Endocrine evaluation revealed secondary hypogonadism with low follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone but intact thyrotroph and lactotroph axes. An ACTH test was performed with a subnormal cortisol response (30-minute cortisol 248 nmol/L, reference > 420 nmol/L) and low plasma ACTH concentration, indicating secondary adrenal insufficiency, and the patient started treatment with hydrocortisone. The somatotroph axis was not evaluated. Visual field measured by perimetry revealed visual field defects in the right eye.\nThe tumor was initially diagnosed based on MRI as a craniopharyngioma for which reason the patient was referred to craniotomy as standard treatment. At surgery, the tumor appeared gray and reddish, and was capsulated and fragile with easy bleeding, unlike craniopharyngiomas with sharp, irregular borders, which have a tendency to adhere to vital neurovascular structures and often consist of cystic and/or solid parts []. The pituitary tumor was partially resected, and a small amount of capsule remnant underneath the optic chiasm could not be surgically removed. Perioperative frozen section histological examination described the tumor as a possible malignant lymphoma due to lymphocytic infiltration.\nThe patient was transferred to the Department of Endocrinology at Odense University Hospital for further diagnostic workup and management of pituitary hormone deficiencies. Postoperatively, the patient was still affected by headache and visual deficits on ophthalmologic assessment. MRI showed regression of the pituitary mass (9 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 8 mm), but remnant pituitary tissue was located just below the optic chiasm (Fig. B). Pituitary hormone insufficiency of all anterior axes and diabetes insipidus was diagnosed, and treatment with hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, testosterone, growth hormone, and desmopressin was implemented.\nEndocrine evaluation did not support a hormone-producing adenoma. Sellar lymphoma is a very rare disease often related to immunodeficiency, for example HIV-related, or seen in immunocompetent patients who are over 60 years old []. Metastasis was not suspected; the patient did not suffer from cancer in another location. Workup for infectious and rheumatologic etiologies was not indicative of secondary hypophysitis, nor was drug-related infiltration of the pituitary gland a possible differential diagnosis. Final histological diagnosis showed lymphoid reaction with predominant CD20 positive B-cell infiltration and no sign of significant IgG4 involvement. The patient was diagnosed with autoimmune hypophysitis.\nTen months postoperatively, the patient reported impaired vision. MRI showed that the remnant tissue lifted and exerted pressure at the optic chiasm. Perimetry confirmed progression of visual field defects in the right eye and now involvement of the left eye. Because of progression of visual field defects, treatment with glucocorticoid pulse therapy was initiated: methylprednisolone 500 mg infusion for 3 days, followed by reduced prednisolone doses, that is, 37.5 mg per day. Follow-up MRI after 1 month of glucocorticoid treatment (11 months postoperatively) demonstrated significant reduction of the pituitary mass and decreased pressure at the optic chiasm. Perimetry was unchanged. Treatment with prednisolone continued for 3 months.\nThe patient had intolerable adverse effects to glucocorticoid treatment with excessive weight gain of about 50 kg and cushingoid features. The need for long-term treatment led to initiation of steroid-sparing treatment with 150 mg azathioprine per day under gradual tapering of prednisolone (13 months postoperatively). Visual field defects improved, and repeated MRI showed additional regression of the remnant pituitary mass. Perimetry revealed stable conditions. Due to stable condition over 26.5 months, treatment with azathioprine was reduced. Control MRI after one and a half month showed recurrence with increasing mass in sella turcica causing mass effect on the optic chiasm. Treatment was resumed: azathioprine 100 mg per day in combination with prednisolone 37.5 mg per day.\nDespite additional 11 months treatment with azathioprine and prednisolone treatment (52 months postoperatively), control MRI showed further progression with increasing pituitary mass size (11 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 7 mm) reaching the optic chiasm (Fig. C). Treatment with rituximab was initiated: 1000 mg infusions 14 days apart, repeated every 12 months. This resulted in almost complete regression of pituitary mass (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 7 mm) evaluated by MRI (Fig. D). Rituximab treatment was discontinued after 25 months (77 months postoperatively) because of stable disease. To date, the patient has been followed up for ten and a half years postoperatively. According to control MRI 4 years after end of treatment with rituximab, he is in sustained remission with unchanged pituitary mass size and no affection of the optic chiasm.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

She ran a bar\u2013tobacco shop with significant long-term exposure to passive smoking. She was not exposed to asbestos. Clinical examination on admission revealed good performance status, stage 1 modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea, crackles at lung bases, and no digital clubbing or extrathoracic signs. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed interstitial lung disease (ILD) with subpleural reticulations without evidence of honeycombing or enlarged lymph node (Fig. ). Standard biology, serological testing, bronchoscopy, and bronchoalveolar lavage were normal. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated bronchial obstruction [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, 0.66; FEV1, 97% of predicted values (% pred.)], preserved volumes [FVC, 121% pred.; total lung capacity (TLC), 111% pred.], and alteration of gas diffusion (TLCO, 62% pred.). ILD multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) reached a CT pattern of possible usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which led to the proposal of performing surgical lung biopsy. Wedge resection of the right upper and lower lobes was performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in July 2017. Both resected lung specimens showed a similar pattern of UIP: fibroblastic foci and honeycombing. In addition, the right lower lobe specimen displayed numerous disseminated foci of well-differentiated focally invasive SCC without invasion of visceral pleura (Fig. ). Complete resection was obtained without SCC-positive surgical margins. A PET\u2013CT scan performed in September 2017 showed mild hypermetabolism of ILD [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), 3.5], without hypermetabolic lung nodule, mass, or enlarged lymph node. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal. There was no indication for adjuvant antineoplastic treatment based on pathological findings. After ILD MDD in October 2017, it was decided to introduce an antifibrotic treatment owing to pathological confirmation of UIP. Nintedanib was chosen as this molecule is also known for its antitumor properties. At the last follow-up in October 2019, that is, 2 years after initiation of nintedanib, clinical, functional (FVC, 130% pred.; TLCO, 61% pred.), and CT scan evaluations were stable (Fig. ).

He had a history of having undergone open suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) 8 years ago for acute urinary retention secondary to recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). He developed surgical site infection (SSI) postoperatively which was managed conservatively. The stricture had been managed with internal optic urethrotomy (IOU) and serial dilatations, following which the patient started doing well with 6 monthly dilatations.\nSince last 2 years, he developed a swelling in the right inguinoscrotal region associated with repeated thinning of urinary stream and recurrent episodes of burning micturition. The swelling became static and persistent in the last 2 months.\nOn examination, there was a 5-cm long vertical midline scar in the suprapubic region. An irreducible soft swelling of 8 cm \u00d7 6 cm was present in the right inguinal region which extended up to the base of scrotum. Cough impulse was present, and we could not get above the swelling. The defect could not be localized. There was also a gradual growing difficulty in negotiating urethral dilators due to the path distortion by the contents of the hernia. Cystoscopy revealed narrowing in bulbar urethra with deviations in the proximal anterior urethra and the scope needed to be negotiated to reach the urinary bladder. Ultrasound showed findings consistent with right inguinal omentocele and a scarred suprapubic region. Defect could not be localized.\nThe patient had been coaxed for surgery multiple times but he did not agree due to poor past surgical experience. He eventually landed with difficulty in micturition and inability to get dilators passed. A preoperative diagnosis of right sided, complete, irreducible, inguinal omentocele with urethral stricture was made, and the patient was planned for right open hernioplasty with cystourethroscopy along with IOU.\nIntraoperatively, a right indirect hernial sac with omentum as content was found; the sac was opened, omentum resected, and sac was transfixed at its neck followed by posterior wall strengthening. Another hernial sac with omentum as content was found in midline beneath the scar of old SPC which was densely adherent to the surrounding fibrotic tissue (\n). This sac was dissected out, opened, content resected, and sac was closed. For the right inguinal hernia, a mesh hernioplasty was done. After the closure of the external oblique aponeurosis, anatomical repair of midline defect was achieved and strengthening was done with overlay mesh covering the midline defect. On cystourethroscopy, a stricture was present from posterior part of penile urethra to bulbar urethra. IOU was done and 18-Fr Foley's catheter left in situ.\nA postoperative diagnosis of right-sided, complete, irreducible, indirect inguinal hernia, and incisional hernia with omentum as contents with urethral stricture was made. The patient developed SSI on post operative day (POD)-2 which was managed by wound irrigation and oral antibiotics.\nAt follow-up after 1 month, a repeat cystourethroscopy was performed which showed fibrosis and narrowing at the site of IOU. A repeat IOU was done. The anterior urethra had straightened out and dilatation was simple and smooth. The patient now has a good urinary stream, no complaint of restriction in passage and dilatations have become a smooth affair. The patient has been on 4 monthly dilatation for the past year which have all been smooth and has now been called after 6 months for next follow-up.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows individual\u2019s risk factors for development of condition', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Preoperative computed tomography (CT) suggested resectable pancreatic cancer of the pancreatic body (Fig. A) concomitant with stricture of the CA root (Fig. B), which may have been caused by median arcuate ligament (MAL). Pancreaticoduodenectomy with division of the MAL was scheduled. Unexpected bleeding around the CA was observed during surgery, which may have been caused by the injury incurred when the MAL was cut to release CA compression (Fig. A, B). As bleeding could be controlled by simple compression only, hemostasis by suturing was attempted first. Contrary to our expectations, the bleeding intensified, making it difficult to confirm the bleeding point. Therefore, we attempted supraceliac aortic cross-clamping (SAC) to manage bleeding. To expose the aorta, the crus of the diaphragm was divided, and the aorta was clamped upstream of the CA by a Fogarty vascular-clamp forceps. After performing SAC, the bleeding intensity significantly decreased and a defect of the adventitia measuring 7 mm in diameter on the CA was confirmed (Fig. C). The defect was repaired using a 4-0 Prolene continuous suture (Johnson & Johnson K.K, NJ, USA). The procedure time for SAC was 2 min and 51 s, and the intraoperative blood loss was 480 ml. The maximum blood pressure increased from 120 to 150 mmHg when SAC was performed and then decrease to 120 mmHg after releasing the clamp.

Clinical examination revealed multiple, bilateral enlarged cervical lymph nodes which were firm to hard in consistency. Thyroid examination revealed a 2 \u00d7 2 cm firm lump on the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe. Examination of other lymph node groups revealed enlarged right inguinal lymph nodes. Abdominal examination and rectal examination were normal. Vaginal examination revealed a hard, unhealthy uterine cervix. Breast and axillary examination were unremarkable.

{"clinical_note": "As home care doctors and general practitioners, we encountered a 37-year-old woman with ASD who lived with her parents in Japan. Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.\nWhen we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not. She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them. Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder. We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer. The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\nAfter a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him \u201cDidn't you hear, Dad?\u201d in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother. Her mother died peacefully without any severe pain or discomfort. The woman with ASD did not become confused and was able to accept her mother's death peacefully with her father.", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'knows what to ask to obtain pertinent additional history', 'recognizes associated conditions of a disease', 'educates patients', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions']"}

The screening investigations specific for multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma results showed that this patient was negative for serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, and free light chain assay. The final diagnosis was confirmed to be consistent with stage II PBL.\nWith curative intent, bortezomib was initiated (2.3 mg d1, 4, 8, 11) in combination with CDOP (cyclophosphamide 1.3 g d2, epirubicin 40 mg d2, vindesine 4 mg d21, prednisolone 65 mg d2\u20136) chemotherapy regimen on a 21-day cycle. After two cycles of V-CDOP, enhanced MRI scanning on February 11, 2019, revealed an excellent initial response, with a substantial decrease in the size and intensity of nasopharyngeal lesions (). After three cycles of the V-CDOP regimen, re-evaluation of the 18F-FDG PET/CT in the transverse dimension on May 21, 2019, showed a diminished range of lesions to 3.8 cm \u00d7 2.9 cm \u00d7 3.8 cm and reduced 18F-FDG uptake in the left maxillary sinus (SUVmax, 7.0; SUVmean, 4.5) and other regions (SUVmax, 4.0; SUVmean, 3.6) (). The patient achieved a partial response (PR) after five cycles of V-CDOP chemotherapy treatment.\nThis planned treatment was followed by mobilization and collection of autologous peripheral blood stem cells on May 24, 2019. After one cycle of V-CDOP, enhanced MRI scanning revealed no significant change on June 27, 2019 (). On regular follow-up, he received local radiotherapy (RT) to nasopharyngeal regions (30 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks). After RT, he was switched to two cycles of V-CDOP regimens supplemented with lenalidomide (25 mg d1\u201321) on August 9 and September 10, 2019. The main toxic side effect was grade 2 myelosuppression and improved after symptomatic treatment. Subsequent enhancement MRI scanning revealed a reduction in the size of nasopharyngeal lesions on September 14, 2019 (). The therapeutic assessment by FDG PET/CT on September 29, 2019, showed a complete metabolic response (cMR), a diminished range of lesions to 1.0 cm \u00d7 1.3 cm, significantly reduced 18F-FDG uptake in the left maxillary sinus (SUVmax, 3.5; SUVmean, 2.5), and a lack of metabolic activity in other regions ().\nThe patient received conditioning BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) high-dose chemotherapy with consolidative autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in October 25, 2019. A total of 8.6 \u00d7 108/kg mononuclear cells (MNCs) and 2.1 \u00d7 106/kg CD34+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBSCs) were reinfused, and complete engraftment was observed by day + 11. During autologous transplantation, he experienced grade 4 myelosuppression, requiring G-CSF. To consolidate the response, the patient received lenalidomide-based maintenance therapy after the transplant. A repeated enhancement MRI scanning showed increased abnormal signal shadows in the maxillary sinus, which was considered as an inflammatory reaction on May 6, 2020 (). He developed herpes zoster during maintenance treatment on October 2020. Follow-up PET-CT on March 10, 2021 showed continued cMR 16 months after ASCT ().

{"clinical_note": "A 19-year-old man presented to our institute with right hand and foot dyskinesia. He had a significant family history of PKD. His uncle, grandfather, and grandfather's brother had involuntary movements triggered by voluntary movements. Proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) on chromosome 16, which is associated with movement disorders including PKD (PRRT2-PxMD), was confirmed in his uncle and grandfather through genetic testing (c.649delC/pArg217-Glufs). All of them underwent stereotactic ablative surgery (Vo thalamotomy). The patient's grandfather and grandfather's brother experienced complete remission of involuntary movement attacks after the surgery. His uncle experienced a significant reduction in the frequency of daily attacks without medication. The patient first experienced paroxysmal involuntary left hand and toe flexion with left forearm pronation triggered by sudden voluntary movements at the age of 14. The frequency of attacks was 20\u201330 per day. Carbamazepine (100 mg/day) was prescribed, which led to a significant reduction in the frequency of attacks. However, drowsiness was significant after the intake of carbamazepine and significantly interfered with his daily life, especially school life. He underwent right-sided Vo thalamotomy at the age of 15, which resulted in complete resolution of PKD attacks immediately after the surgery. The detailed clinical course of right-sided Vo thalamotomy has been reported previously (). Four months after the thalamotomy, the patient developed right elbow, hand, and toe flexion (). The frequency of attacks was 10\u201320 per day. The duration of the attacks ranged from 10 to 20 seconds. Carbamazepine (100 mg/day) was prescribed again, and the PKD attacks reduced to 5\u201310 times per day. However, the drowsiness induced by carbamazepine severely interfered with his daily and school lives. He underwent left-sided Vo thalamotomy at the age of 19. The target coordinate of the left Vo nucleus was set the same as in the previous surgery (15-mm lateral, 2-mm posterior, and 1-mm superior to the midpoint of the anterior commissure-posterior commissure). A total of six lesions were created on the left Vo nucleus in the same manner as in the previous surgery. Immediately after surgery, the PKD attacks resolved completely. However, mild dysarthria developed, which spontaneously resolved within three months. Left-sided PKD attacks never developed six years after the right Vo thalamotomy, and right-sided PKD attacks never developed two years after the left Vo thalamotomy without medication. The locations of the coagulated lesions were confirmed using Brainlab Elements. Bilateral lesions covered the Vo and ventral intermediate (Vim) nuclei (). The Vo nucleus is located just anterior to the Vim nucleus of the thalamus. We included both anterior and posterior coagulated lesions in order to cover the entire Vo nucleus. Based on our experience, insufficient lesions to cover the Vo nucleus are likely to develop symptomatic recurrence. The time course of PKD onset and intervention is shown in . The data for this study were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Considering the observational nature of the study, the ethics committee of our institution approved this study, and patient consent was waived.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}

On July 2020, the chest CT scan revealed the presence of an upper left lung lobe and two lower left lung lobe lesions. On August 2020, the patient underwent a wedge resection of the upper and the lower lung lobes lesions with N1 and N2 nodal sampling.\nGross examination of the surgical specimens of the first atypical pulmonary resection of left inferior lobe revealed an Intraparenchymal, peripheral, solid, yellow-white lesion measuring 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Histological assessment identified a well-circumscribed lesion composed of two different morphological components, tightly adhered but not intermingled each other. The first component represented about 60% of the whole neoplasm and was characterized by a solid and trabecular proliferation of polygonal-shaped uniform tumor cells, with nuclei with finely granular chromatin and inconspicuocus nucleoli, consistent with carcinoid. Four mitosis/2 mm2 were identified, without tumoral necrosis. The second component, which represented about 40% of whole neoplasm, showed a main lepidic, non-mucinous pattern with secondary papillary architecture, corresponding to a lepidic-papillary pattern PA. Immunoreactivity for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, and pan-cytokeratins AE1\u20133 was documented in carcinoid component, while adenocarcinomatous component was positive only for TTF-1 and cytokeratins (). CK7 immunoreactivity was selectively documented in the adenocarcinomatous component. A final diagnosis of \u201ccombined pulmonary adenocarcinoma with atypical carcinoid\u201d was made. No immunoreactivity for ALK and ROS1 was documented in both components. TPS for PD-L1 was <1% in both components. Both two other lesions on atypical pulmonary resections of the upper left lobe and inferior left lobe showed intraparenchymal neoplasm of 1.8 and 1.5 cm, respectively, corresponding both to PA with a main solid pattern and lepidic, non-mucinous second pattern. A positivity ROS1 score of 2+ with gene rearrangement on FISH was documented in the upper pulmonary lobe neoplasia. No immunoreactivity for ALK and a PD-L1 TPS of 1%\u201349% were observed. No immunoreactivity for ALK and ROS1 with PD-L1 TPS of >50% were documented in the lower lobe neoplasia. No pleural invasion was observed. No lymph nodes metastases were found. The final UICC 2017 stage pT4 (m-3) (PL0) pN0 was assigned.\nTargeted NGS analysis on Ion Torrent NGS platform using the Ocav3 panel was performed on DNA and RNA extracted from each microdissected histological components of the primary mixed neoplasm (I1/I2) and in the other two adenocarcinomas located in the inferior (I3) and superior (S1) left pulmonary lobes. Summary of genetic results are shown in \n. Among a total of 161 investigated genes included in the NGS panel, both common and private somatic genes mutations were identified in each entity (). The adenocarcinoma I1 and carcinoid I2 components of the mixed neoplasm shared the same mutations in BRAF (p.Gly466Ala), NF1 (p.Pro1359LeufsTer19 and p.Glu1928Ter), STK11 (p.Gly188AlafsTer99), and AKT2 (p.Leu52Ter) genes. Four additional somatic mutations were detected in the DDR2 (p.Arg806Ter), CDK6 (p.Thr107Ser), and SMARCA4 gene (p.Arg1135Gln) were identified in the adenocarcinoma component, whereas no specific mutations were identified in the carcinoid component. A different genetic profile emerged from the molecular analysis of the two additional adenocarcinoma nodules I3 and S1, lacking those somatic mutations identified in the mixed nodules, but shared two somatic missense mutations in the KRAS (p.Gly12Asp) and NOTCH1 (p.Pro498Arg). In addition, the I3 adenocarcinoma showed a specific, somatic mutations in ATM (p.Gln1117Ter), TP53 (p.Gly245Asp), and CDK12 (p.Arg44Trp) genes, whereas the S1 adenocarcinoma showed a specific, somatic, missense mutations in IDH2 gene (p.Arg172Ser).\nSince November 2020, considering the ROS1 positivity, the patient started crizotinib, which is still ongoing, reporting a stable disease.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Histologically, a well-circumscribed neoplasia composed of two different morphological components, which were separated in some areas and intermingled in others, was documented. The first component represented about 70% of the tumor burden and consisted of an organoid proliferation of polygonal, shaped uniform tumor cells with nuclei with finely granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli, consistent with carcinoid. Four mitosis/2 mm2 and diffuse, punctate necrosis were identified. The second component, representing about 30% of the tumor burden, showed a glandular architecture corresponding to acinar pattern of PA. Neoplastic infiltration of parietal pleura was documented (PL3). Immunoreactivity for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, and pan-cytokeratins (AE1-3 clone) was observed in carcinoid component, while glandular component was positive only for TTF-1 and cytokeratins; cytokeratin 7 was selectively expressed in the adenocarcinomatous component (). Metastatis constituted by both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine component was found in four out of six hilar lymph nodes, showing the same immunoreactivity in different neoplastic areas such as primitive lesion (). Immunoreactivity for ALK and ROS1 resulted negative in both component, in primitive tumor and in lymph nodal metastasis. TPS for PD-L1 was <1% in both component, in primitive tumor and in lymph nodal metastasis. A final diagnosis of \u201ccombined pulmonary adenocarcinoma with atypical carcinoid\u201d was made with stage pT3 (PL3) pN2 sec UICC 2017.

The finding of anemia was noted, but the lack of any corresponding elevation in bilirubin made acute hemolysis less likely. The hyponatremia was felt to be consistent with the patient's hypervolemic clinical picture. The lack of leukocytosis was noted, though limited inferences can be made from this value in isolation. Overall, the laboratory results made acute decompensated congestive heart failure and bacterial pneumonia lower on the differential.\nA 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with normal axis and intervals, with no acute injury pattern and no evidence of right-heart strain. A chest radiograph was obtained () and was interpreted by the radiologist as demonstrating \u201cbilateral patchy atelectasis\u201d\u2014however, the emergency physicians felt it demonstrated a pleural-based wedge-like consolidation in the right inferior lobe consistent with Hampton's Hump. The initial differential considered by the providers included pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and infectious endocarditis. At this time, a third set of blood cultures were added to the patient's workup.\nA limited bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (Figures and ) in the ED revealed findings concerning for tricuspid valve vegetations as well as a slightly enlarged right ventricle without any D-sign (i.e., a D-shaped left ventricle on parasternal short-axis view, consistent with right ventricular strain causing shift of the ventricular septum). Cardiology was consulted for concern for potential IE. A CT-angiogram (CTA) of the chest was ordered to assess for pulmonary embolism and further characterize the pulmonary lesions seen on radiography, and the patient received intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover possible community-acquired pneumonia while the CTA was pending. The CTA revealed findings consistent with multiple septic emboli and mycotic aneurysms (Figures and ), as well as multiple segmental pulmonary arterial occlusions with associated infarcts or hemorrhage. A stat formal echocardiogram was obtained and interpreted at bedside by the cardiology fellow, confirming the presence of tricuspid vegetations as well as moderate tricuspid regurgitation, with no evidence of right ventricular strain.\nThe patient was treated with IV vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin to provide coverage for possible MRSA endocarditis, due to the concern for possible undisclosed IVDU, and was admitted with consultation of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Infectious Disease (ID).\nThe patient was maintained on IV gentamycin and vancomycin and underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) on hospital day 2 which revealed a large 2.0 \u00d7 2.1 cm posterior leaflet tricuspid valve vegetation with severe tricuspid regurgitation. On hospital day 5, the patient admitted to a history of heroin IVDU but was not forthcoming about the date of her most recent use, and a urine toxicologic screen was negative. The patient underwent a tricuspid valve annuloplasty and reconstruction using autologous pericardial tissue by Cardiothoracic Surgery on hospital day 8. The patient's blood cultures remained negative on hospital day 9, at which time ID recommended the patient receive ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily for 6 weeks. Pathology of the valve leaflets resulted on hospital day 10 and indicated granulation tissue with focal areas of bacterial colonization without bacterial identification. The remainder of the patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, and on hospital day 15, she was transferred in good condition to a skilled nursing facility to complete her 6-week course of IV ceftriaxone.

{"clinical_note": "We present a 5-year-old female child who was symptomatic since the early neonatal period with skin lesions, intermittent painless vaginal bleeding, and breast enlargement. For these complaints, the parents took the child to the nearby health facility, but they were reassured. Compared to her peers, her growth in length was fast since her early childhood, but she had poor weight gain. At the age of 3 \u00bd years, she presented to an orthopedic clinic with bowlegs for which she was seen and sent home without any intervention. But after one week, she had a trivial fall down accident, and she sustained pathological fractures on both upper and lower extremities. Plaster of Paris (POP) cast was applied for the lower left arm, and open fixation with plate was done for the left femur.\nDuring the procedure, tachycardia was detected, for which she was investigated and diagnosed to have hyperthyroidism. She was initially put on propylthiouracil (PTU) and propranolol. After eight months of the procedure, there was displacement of the plate. The orthopedic surgeon decided to revise the operation, but the thyroid function was not controlled for which she was referred to a paediatric endocrinology clinic for better management of hyperthyroidism.\nOn physical examination at the paediatric endocrinology clinic, she was emaciated. Her weight was 16 kg (between 10th and 25th percentiles) and her height was 115 cm (on the 95th percentiles). Weight for height was far less than 5th percentile (underweight), based on CDC growth charts. Her pulse rate was 123 bpm, and she had protruded eyes.

{"clinical_note": "A 45-year-old obese man (height, 178.7 cm; weight, 97 Kg; body mass index, 30.8 kg/m2) complained of general fatigue and drowsiness at work. A blood examination revealed severe diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 10.6%), and he was accordingly referred to our university. Treatment for diabetes mellitus was started and extensive evaluations for sleep apnea syndrome were performed. Although treatment using a continuous positive airway pressure mask was initiated, general fatigue continued. Concurrently, SITSH was diagnosed based on the following findings: serum TSH, 6.890 \u00b5IU/mL; free T3, 4.9 pg/mL; and free T4, 2.29 ng/dL.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland revealed a poorly enhanced mass measuring 5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 8 mm ( and ). The TRH loading test showed a low and delayed TSH response (pre-TSH, 6.89 \u00b5IU/mL; max TSH, 10.8 \u00b5IU/mL; 60 minutes after TRH loading). However, there were no abnormal responses for both GH and PRL on several other loading tests. The absence of a family history of SITSH or TR\u03b2 gene mutations prompted the diagnosis of thyrotroph adenoma.\nInitial treatment with the somatostatin analog (SSA) did not yield any response. Further, the free T4 levels remained over 2 ng/dL after 3 courses of lanreotide autogel (90 mg). Since his diabetes mellitus was already under control, we decided to remove the tumor surgically.\nThe surgery was performed using the standard endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. The pituitary gland appeared normal on the surface. However, a midline split revealed a well-circumscribed whitish tumor inside the pituitary gland (). Complete tumor resection was achieved (), and tumor tissues were collected wherever possible. As the intraoperative pathological diagnosis ruled out a pituitary adenoma, tissue samples for electron microscopy were obtained.\nHis serum TSH levels decreased drastically to 0.320 \u00b5IU/mL on postoperative day 1. However, the patient developed transient diabetes insipidus that was treated with oral desmopressin acetate tablets. Three days after the operation, he was diagnosed with influenza type A, followed by hyponatremia with a minimum serum Na level of 118 mEq/L. Electrolyte levels were closely monitored during the treatment for influenza, and he was discharged 18 days after the operation without any electrolyte management. Oral administration of hydrocortisone and levothyroxine was started after the operation, which was tapered and ceased completely after 3 months.\nThe patient\u2019s complaint of fatigue improved, and his cardiac heart rate was reduced by 10 bpm. Blood examination 6 months after the operation revealed an improvement in endocrinological parameters, including serum TSH (0.808 \u00b5IU/mL), free T3 (2.9 pg/mL), and free T4 (1.35 ng/dL). The TRH loading test showed a normal TSH response (pre-TSH, 0.589 \u00b5IU/mL; max TSH, 7.830 \u00b5IU/mL) 30 minutes after TRH loading. The patient has remained healthy for 2 years without tumor recurrence.\nPostoperative MRI revealed complete tumor resection. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the tumor was composed of small- to large-sized neuronal or ganglionic cells containing abundant acidophilic cytoplasm and nuclei with a prominent nucleolus against a background of fine, fibrillar, neuropil-like matrix ( and ), which were diffusely immunoreactive to synaptophysin, chromogranin A, neurofilament, and NCAM (CD56), and partially immunoreactive to NeuN (). Interjacent small cells were considered to be reactive lymphocytes and not adenomatous cells based on their immunoreactivity to CD3. The cytoplasm of the tumor cells with peripheral displacement of the nucleus was immunoreactive for low-molecular-weight keratins, CAM 5.2, and patchy reactive for CK7 ( and ), but not for CK5/6, CK 8, CK 20, and CK 34\u03b2E12, supporting the exclusion of paragangliomas. Further, the absence of immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein confirmed the exclusion of ganglioglioma (). Although Ki-67 staining revealed a labeling index of 2.6%, no other atypical features were detected. Only 0.4% of the entire tumor showed P53 immunopositivity. Based on these findings, a final pathological diagnosis of isolated GC was made.\nWith respect to the pituitary and hypothalamic hormones, the cytoplasm of the tumor cells showed diffuse but strong immunoreactivity for TSH () and equivocal faint positivity for gonadotropin; however, it was negative for GH, PRL, and ACTH. Meanwhile, it also showed diffuse but strong immunoreactivity to TRH (). Transcription factors such as the acidophilic cell lineage transcription factor Pit-1, SF-1, Tpit, ER, and GATA-2 are important to pituitary cytodifferentiation from the Rathke pouch stem cell. Further immunohistochemical studies for these transcription factors revealed diffuse and strong nuclear immunoreactivity for Pit-1 and GATA-2 ( and ), but not for SF-1, Tpit, and ER, confirming thyrotropic cell differentiation of tumor cells. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is a tissue-specific transcription factor that regulates the expression of selected genes in the thyroid, lung, and diencephalon for embryonic development and differentiation; it is well known that it aids in nuclear expression, specifically that of posterior pituitary, thyroid, and lung tumors (, ). All tumor cells stained negatively for TTF-1. Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) status may predict treatment response to first- and second-generation SSAs. With respect to SSTR membranous immunopositivity proposed by Volante et al (), more than 50% of tumor cells stained positively for SSTR2 (Score 3 ()); however, none of the cells stained positively for SSTR5 (Score 0).\nBased on these immunohistochemical findings, this tumor was considered to be differentiated into an entirely neuronal lineage rather than mixed or interjacent with 2 components. Electron microscopy revealed the tumor cell has a light nucleus with a prominent nucleolus, which is surrounded by many secretary granules, synaptic vesicles, and some lysosomes in the cytoplasm. Typical neuronal processes contained both dense core vesicles and clear vesicles ().", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'interpret laboratory or other diagnostic study results and identify current/future status of patient', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 28-year-old nonbinary individual presumed female at birth has recently commenced full masculinizing hormone therapy with transdermal testosterone gel. You receive a referral from their primary care physician concerned about polycythemia. Their hemoglobin is 168 g/L with hematocrit 0.49, which has been flagged in the laboratory report as high (reported with female reference range of 115-155g/L and 0.33-0.45 relative to the male reference interval of 120-170g/L and 0.36-0.50).\nAndrogens are known to stimulate erythropoiesis while the impact of estrogens are not as well understood. In trans people who have been on established and full-dose feminizing hormone therapy (estradiol and anti-androgen) for at least 6 months, there is a significant decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count to the female reference range (, ). Conversely after 6 months of masculinizing testosterone therapy, trans people demonstrate an increase in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count to the male reference range (, , , ). Serum hematocrit in the range of the affirmed gender is evident from 3 months after commencing gender-affirming hormone therapy (). Of note, there are association studies suggesting higher hematocrit is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (, ). This is probably a consideration for people using masculinizing hormone therapy, more so than those using feminizing hormone therapy. As smoking may additionally increase hematocrit, smoking cessation should be emphasized in those with elevated hematocrit. While the long-term cardiovascular implications of using a different reference range for hemoglobin or hematocrit are unclear in general, reference ranges of the affirmed gender should be used. Female reference ranges should be used for someone taking gender-affirming feminizing hormone therapy and male reference ranges should be used for people using masculinizing hormone therapy.\nIn trans women, there is a small statistically significant but clinically insignificant rise in platelet count (which remains within the normal reference range) shown in several cohort studies after 6 to 12 months of feminizing hormone treatment (, ), while white blood cells do not change significantly. No apparent changes are observed in either platelet count or white blood cells with masculinizing hormone therapy (, ).\nCase 1 outlines a nonbinary individual presumed female at birth receiving full-dose masculinizing hormone therapy. In this case, the male reference range for hemoglobin and hematocrit would be most appropriate and this should be shared with the nonbinary individual so they are aware and can expect to be misgendered when reviewing their own results. As such, their hemoglobin of 168 g/L and hematocrit of 0.49 would fall within the expected reference range and no change in management needs to occur.\nReference ranges for serum ferritin, a common indicator of body iron status, vary depending on age and sex (). Ferritin reference ranges are typically lowest in premenopausal people presumed female at birth, followed by postmenopausal people and are highest in people presumed male at birth, with lower limits of the female reference range approximately 10 to 20 ug/L below that of the male reference range (30 ug/L) (). This may be partially attributed to increased iron utilization in menstruating individuals resulting in lower ferritin, as well as a multitude of factors that have been shown to impact upon adult serum ferritin levels including age, body mass index, waist to hip ratio, and liver function (, ). Animal studies suggest that iron is distributed differently in males and females associated with differences in hepatic hepcidin expression rather than sex-steroid concentrations (, ). No studies have evaluated whether ferritin or other iron indicators change with gender-affirming hormone therapy.\nFrom a practical perspective, the main reason to evaluate for iron deficiency is anemia. In individuals who have a ferritin below the \u201cmale\u201d reference range, we suggest interpreting the iron studies in the context of red cell indices such as mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration to guide management rather than on the use of gender-affirming hormone therapy. If the trans individual is menstruating or pregnant, it would be most practical to use the premenopausal female reference range for interpretation of iron studies.\nFor evaluation of possible iron overload, in situations of borderline results which fall between the female and male reference ranges, relying on the absolute ferritin level or transferrin saturation will be difficult. It is pertinent to assess for concurrent inflammatory disease, liver disease, or iron overload states, such as hemochromatosis, which may further guide clinical management.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "A cardiologist calls as they are planning a coronary angiogram for a 68-year-old trans woman and are concerned because the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is unknown. They are uncertain how to risk stratify her for potential contrast-induced nephropathy. She has a history of longstanding hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, vaginoplasty, and has been on various formulations of estradiol therapy for over 20 years. On review of her investigations, her serum creatinine is 109 umol/L (1.23 mg/dL) but her eGFR has not been reported for the last 18 months. Laboratory providers cannot report eGFR if a male or female marker is not provided on the request form, as this is required along with age to estimate eGFR. Using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula, if classified as female, the eGFR would be 45 mL/min/1.73m\nclassed as Stage 3 chronic kidney disease and would meet the guidelines for intravenous hydration prior to procedure. However, if classified male, the patient would have an eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73m\nwhich would be classed as Stage 2 chronic kidney disease and would not require prehydration. Which is the most appropriate eGFR to use?\nAccurately assessing renal function is essential for not only assessment of renal diseases, but also clinical situations that may potentially affect renal function (such as diabetes or radioiodine contrast administration) as well as considerations for medication dosing of renally cleared drugs. The most commonly used marker of renal function in clinical pathology laboratories is eGFR, which is calculated based upon an individual\u2019s serum creatinine level, age, and sex (). Typically, people presumed male at birth have a higher eGFR than people presumed female at birth at the same level of serum creatinine because the formula assumes a higher muscle mass in men contributing to the serum creatinine independent of renal function. The difference between these groups (given the same age and weight) is more marked at higher levels (with a difference of approximately 30 when eGFR\u2005>90 mL/min/1.73m2), becoming much more similar as eGFR declines (difference of approximately 4 when eGFR\u2005<30 mL/min/1.73m2). In clinical situations where accurate assessment of renal function is necessary, such as in the transplant setting, it may be more appropriate to use 24-hour urine creatinine clearance, urinary inulin clearance (), or serum cystatin c levels, which are less affected by sex and not affected by muscle mass in contrast to serum creatinine (). Inulin clearance and cystatin c are more expensive and less readily available. Creatinine clearance can be calculated on paired 24-hour urine and serum creatinine concentration and is independent of muscle mass and sex steroids. This can provide a baseline estimation for renal function and cumulative serum creatinine results can then be used to monitor decline in renal function with aging.\nFrom a practical perspective, laboratory reports will need to make an assessment on how to report the eGFR for trans individuals. For individuals receiving masculinizing or feminizing hormone therapy, changes in body composition appear to be maximal in the early period after commencement, evident within the first 3 months of treatment (, ). For those receiving masculinizing hormone therapy with testosterone, given higher muscle mass and lower fat mass compared to females, the male CKD-EPI formula would be more appropriate. Conversely if a person has been on feminizing hormone therapy, which typically induces gain in fat and decrease in muscle mass from 3 months of use, then the female equations should be used. It would be a challenging task to expect pathology laboratories to provide the \u201cright\u201d eGFR given limited access to clinical information.\nWe recommend that the treating clinician specify the sex-specific reference interval desired for reporting on the laboratory request (ie, female for a trans person using feminizing hormone therapy). Using current laboratory information systems, the gender marker can be used as a field to specify the reference range desired for reporting. While the binary female or male gender may not necessarily reflect the individual\u2019s gender, this will allow for the appropriate reference range to be reported and the trans patient informed so they can prepare to be misgendered. For laboratory providers, if the gender marker is unknown, then treating clinicians should be contacted to specify the sex-specific reference interval desired.\nFor the trans woman described in Case 2 who was on longstanding feminizing hormone therapy with female body composition, the female reference range for renal function would be most appropriate triggering appropriate renoprotection prior to administration of radioiodine contrast for her angiogram. From a harm reduction approach, given the absence of data in the field, if either the male or female calculated eGFR suggests renoprotective strategies, then this can be implemented. A 24-hour urine creatinine clearance can also be performed to more accurately assess renal function.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 70-year-old trans woman who had been on feminizing hormone therapy for 6 months had a PSA performed as part of a routine health check. She was taking transdermal estradiol 100mcg/24hr patches twice weekly and cyproterone acetate 12.5mg daily. Her total testosterone was 1.5 nmol/L (43 ng/dl) and PSA was 2 ng/mL. She had mild lower urinary tract symptoms with reduced urinary flow over a number of years but had no family history of prostate cancer. How should she be managed?\nThere are no studies examining the effect of feminizing hormone therapy on PSA. It is known that androgen deprivation as part of feminizing hormone therapy is associated with a substantially lower risk for prostate cancer than the general male population (). All published case reports of prostate cancer in trans people using feminizing hormone therapy have had histology showing high risk adenocarcinoma with PSA concentrations at diagnosis ranging from 5 to 1722 ng/mL (ng/mL equivalent to ug/L) (, ). Physiologically, in the setting of androgen deprivation in people with a prostate gland, it would be expected that PSA should be lower than the age-specific reference interval. There is insufficient data to recommend a specific cutoff for trans people using feminizing hormone therapy. Individualized decisions based upon clinical history and examination should inform need for serial monitoring for PSA velocity or imaging.\nCase 3 had a digital rectal examination which showed a smooth but mildly enlarged prostate gland.

{"clinical_note": "A 49-year-old trans man who had been on testosterone therapy for 10 years presented to the emergency department with central chest pain. His high-sensitivity cardiac troponin was 24 ng/L (female reference range\u2005<16 ng/L, male reference range\u2005<26 ng/L). How should he be managed?\nCardiac troponin is released from damaged cardiomyocytes and is one of the most common biomarkers used in the prediction of myocardial infarction. There is considerable debate regarding the use of sex-specific reference ranges for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), as there is uncertainty whether the use of sex-specific reference limits impact upon clinical management or outcome prediction (). However, as upper reference limits based on sex-specific 99th percentiles for hs-cTn are subtly higher for people recorded as males than those recorded females in population studies (), use of sex-specific cutoffs for hs-cTn assays have been endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (). The difference has been attributed to people presumed male at birth having a larger cardiac mass as well as subclinical coronary artery disease (). No studies have been performed to examine cardiac mass changes that may occur with masculinizing hormone therapy in people presumed female at birth. There are however data in polycystic ovary syndrome in which high testosterone concentrations are a clinical feature (albeit far lower than testosterone concentrations seen in transgender men). Polycystic ovary syndrome has been associated with higher left ventricular mass index and larger left atrial diameter over 5 years of follow-up, even after adjustment for blood pressure, body mass index, glucose, and lipids (). Large population-based studies have also shown that left ventricular mass correlates with body weight, lean body mass, and fat mass (). There is currently insufficient data to draw an inference regarding the appropriate reference range in people using gender-affirming hormone therapy, and emphasis must be placed on clinical history, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and serial trajectory of hs-cTn levels if the hs-cTn falls in between the male and female-specific reference ranges.\nDespite the fact that Case 4 had been on established testosterone therapy for 10 years with resultant male body composition, there is insufficient data to suggest that cardiac remodeling or change in cardiac size occurs\nwith high (or low) testosterone concentrations. Despite the risk of being oversensitive, in order to minimize the risk of missing an acute coronary event, we suggest that the reference range of the sex presumed at birth (female) should be used to interpret hs-cTn, provided the patient is informed of this rationale in addition to monitoring with serial troponin to ensure there is no rise. Case 3\u2019s subsequent hs-cTn was elevated above the male reference range and his ECG revealed anterior ST-segment depression consistent with acute coronary syndrome.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

The burn occurred when she was 4-year-old. She underwent two reconstructive procedures at 7 and 14 years in local medical centers. Due to the pain caused by the occurrence of cicatricial carcinoma, affecting eating and speaking, she had tried several medical centers for treatment in the past year, but failed for unsuccessful ATI. In preoperative physical examination, severe scar contractures and large tumor of approximately 15 \u00d7 12 cm were observed on the lower lip, neck, and anterior chest (Figure ); the chin, chest, and bilateral armpits fused together; the cervicomental and mentosternal angles completely obliterated; the anterior neck structures, including the larynx, the trachea, and the carotid arteries, were unidentifiable or impalpable. Mouth opening was limited (15 mm) and Mallampati test could not be performed. The left nostril was obstructive for stenosis, but the right nostril breathing was smooth. Preoperative X-rays and a computed tomography scan (data not shown) revealed distortion of the upper airway and no stenosis of the trachea. It was difficult to perform face mask ventilation because of the nearly fixed neck and regressed mandible.\nAccording to the guidelines on the management of difficult airway, awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation with topicalization is preferred in such patients, but the patient rejected ATI for discomfort and nociceptive recall before. Meanwhile, other awake strategies, including lightwand, GlideScope\u24c7 Video laryngoscope, laryngeal mask airway, oral or nasal blind intubation, retrograde intubation, surgical tracheostomy, seem impossible. Therefore, a flexible bronchoscopic intubation protocol under precise sedation, topicalization, and spontaneous respiration preservation seems a promising strategy, but the airway should be secured for there was no definite backup plan.\nA written informed consent was taken with explanation focused on the risks of difficult airway. Atropine 0.5 mg was intramuscular injected to reduce secretion 30 min before transferring to the operating room. The patient was monitored by respiration rate, ventilation volume, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, blood pressure and bispectral index (BIS), and preoxygenated once she arrived in the operation room.

Sevoflurane 2% with a flow rate of 4 L/min with 100% O2 was administered via an endoscopic mask connected to the ventilator circuit. The concentration of sevoflurane was gradually increased to 4% and stopped when the BIS reached 55\u201360 within 3 min, then airway reassessment and precise topicalization were achieved by a modified SAYGO technique., , An epidural catheter (Figure ), with an outer diameter of 3.8 mm, was fixed and 1.5 cm longer was applied at the end of the fiberscope (MDH A10; Zhuhai Mindhao Medical Technology Co., Ltd., ShenZhen, China). Topicalization was achieved by spraying 2% lidocaine (7 ml) via the catheter onto the posterior nasal canal, pharyngeal cavity, epiglottis, glottis, and tracheal (Figure ). Meanwhile, supplemental oxygen 10 L/min was delivered by a hose (Figure ) through the mouth to avoid hypoxemia.

{"clinical_note": "A patient in her late seventies was incidentally found to have a large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm in 2013 for which she had undergone an uneventful percutaneous endovascular aortic repair with left chimney. She lived alone, remained independent in her activities of daily living, and was community ambulant without aid.\nShe was electively admitted in September 2019 for embolization of a type 2 endoleak by the interventional radiologist. Super selective cannulation of the distal aspect of the iliolumbar branch supplying the nidus with a micro catheter was performed. Embolization was carried out using Onyx\u00ae until complete exclusion of the nidus. This was followed by repeat aortogram, which showed complete exclusion of the nidus from right-sided branches. However, there was continued filling of the nidus from the left lumbar branches. It was therefore decided to embolize the left side. After embolization, angiogram showed complete exclusion of the endoleak and the left-sided branches supplying the endo leak.\nFive hours after the procedure the patient complained of bilateral lower limb weakness and numbness, right more than left. Physical examination revealed lower motor neurone pattern of weakness over bilateral lower limbs, right worse than left (Table ). Sensation testing revealed normal sensation over left, impaired sensation for right L2 to S1. Proprioception at bilateral big toes was intact. Reflexes were absent in bilateral lower limbs.\nLumbar spinal drain was inserted to decompress the spinal cord to allow more arterial flow as there was concern with spinal cord ischemia. The patient was started on fluid replacement to maintain the mean arterial pressure above 80 mm Hg. Urgent CT aortogram followed by MRI thoracolumbar spine was performed. Aortogram showed postinterval embolization of bilateral feeding arteries. Onyx material was seen within a branch of the embolized right iliolumbar artery, which extends into the spinal canal at the level of L3 and appears to exit at the level of L2. It ran external to the thecal sac. MRI thoracolumbosacral spine showed no abnormal cord signal or restricted diffusion.\nShe was subsequently admitted for inpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation. On initial functional assessment, she required moderate assistance for bed mobility and transfer with poor dynamic sitting and standing balance. She did not complain of pain. After 1 month of inpatient rehabilitation, she made some neurological recovery with functional improvement. She had good dynamic sitting balance and was able to transfer under supervision. She can self-propel wheelchair within the ward. However, she had poor standing balance and was still unable to ambulate. She was discharged to a subacute rehabilitation facility before being discharged home. Please see her functional improvement over time using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) instrument illustrated in Table .\nElectrophysiology study was performed 12 weeks later showed electrophysiological evidence of an acute right lumbar plexopathy involving the right obturator and femoral nerves, with no evidence of axonal continuity.\nShe was reviewed in the outpatient clinic 14 weeks later. Neurologically remained largely unchanged for right lower limb; however, left lower limb power had further improved to about 4 on manual motor testing. Functionally, she had also made slight progression, and she was able to walk 25 meters using walking frame with 1 person providing standby assist.

Two weeks later (November 2020), he had a recurrence of high spiking fever. Imaging revealed a left-sided lung consolidation. He was treated for probable pneumonia with oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. At 1-month follow-up (December 2020), there was an inadequate clinical improvement with an increase in the size of the consolidation (Figure ). Bronchoscopy was done, and bronchoalveolar lavage grew Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Sputum Xpert-TB-PCR was negative. Multiple blood cultures, bone marrow biopsy and culture reports for routine bacteria, Mycobacterium and fungal organisms were negative. A bronchoscopic transbronchial lung biopsy was done. Histopathology was suggestive of organizing pneumonia. Past COVID-19 infection was considered as the likely cause for organizing pneumonia. He was started on high-dose steroids, with which he improved.\nHe was readmitted in April 2021 with a persistent fever. Since the patient was on high-dose steroids, the fever was attributed to a probable secondary infection or organizing pneumonia itself. Sputum culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an antibiotic, piperacillin, was commenced. Computed tomography thorax showed resolution of the previously seen left lower lobe consolidation but had new-onset bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (Figure ).

An experienced forager, the patient had collected and prepared the mushrooms for dinner. Between six to eight hours later, the patient noted abdominal pain and associated vomiting. The vomitus was bilious in nature with multiple episodes occurring over the next two to three hours. With persistent vomiting, she called an ambulance that brought her to her local hospital. Admission and investigation found a deranged liver profile, and the diagnosis of acute liver failure secondary to the fungi consumption was made. Ms. XY was transferred to the National Liver Unit where she underwent orthotopic liver transplant. Following a tumultuous post-operative course including an ICU admission, and Hepatic, Renal, Plastics, Rheumatology and Dermatology input, an incidental finding on CT of the abdomen/pelvis foreshadowed the orthopaedic trajectory of our patient.\nFollowing discharge from the ICU, the patient began recovery on the ward. At this point, her primary concern was painful discolouration at the pulps of her fingers and toes. Painful lesions were also noted in the right flank region. Dermatology input resulted in a diagnosis of skin necrosis post-transplant with microvascular thrombosis of the hands and feet. Skin graft to the right flank region was performed by the Plastics team. The post-operative period was once again complicated by sepsis and treated with antibiotics. She remained on a prolonged course of steroids for up to six months post-operatively.\nAs XY continued to improve clinically, her recovery was aided by our multi-disciplinary team input. Throughout this period, the patient noted a new onset of groin pain resulting in regression in her mobility. In the proceeding four weeks, Ms. XY continued to suffer from pain, impeding her progress with physiotherapy.

XY described the pain as sharp, without radiation and aggravated by movement. A physical exam revealed an oedematous swollen joint surrounding the cruciate ligament. An MRI was conducted as suggested by the pain team to investigate the integrity of the surrounding soft tissues. The cruciate ligaments, the menisci and both the quadriceips and patellar tendons were found to be intact. The associated musculature was atrophic. Several serpiginous lines within the subchondral marrow of the medial and lateral femoral condyles and in the patella with alternating hyper- and hypointensity were noted. Heterogenous surrounding marrow was also visualized, all of which was depicting AVN and a reactive sclerosis. Orthopaedic intervention was not advised. Evidence is provided in Figure and Figure .\nXY was in bed almost 24 hours a day and was experiencing bilateral hip pain. Normal X-Ray is shown in Figure . However, pelvis MRI now revealed marked bilateral femoral head oedema, with bilateral sepiginous low-signal circumscribed areas also noted in both femoral heads, with advanced loss of joint space and articular cartilage bilaterally (Figure ). A subchondral collapse in the superolateral aspect of the left femoral head was noted (Figure ). Complex effusions were described bilaterally, thus showing a secondary synovial osteochondromatosis. Muscular oedema was noted throughout; the right rectus muscle was severely atrophic. Avascular necrosis was confirmed.\nOrthopaedic input\nOne week later, the patient underwent bilateral total hip replacements. Left femoral neck osteotomy was performed from the posterior approach and Multihole Pinnacle size 50 was inserted. A 48-mm cup was inserted on the right side from the posterior approach. The surgery was conducted under a general anaesthetic and then a spinal anaesthetic. Jubilee dressings were applied bilaterally, and continued for up to three weeks post-operatively.

Unfortunately, it was not possible to evaluate the symptoms of the patient with MRI at this time due to the coronavirus disease pandemic-induced stress on the healthcare system of our country.\nThe patient denied falls or trauma during the pregnancy, nor was there any history of smoking, alcohol abuse, use of glucocorticoids, or presence of rheumatologic/oncologic disease. Additionally, the patient was not malnourished, she underwent routine antenatal care, and took multivitamins. Serologic tests for inflammatory markers, as lab tests for serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and D-dimer returned normal.\nDuring multidisciplinary rounds, it was decided that delaying surgery was the best course of action out of fear of causing either mechanical or fluoroscopy-induced damage to the fetus during total hip arthroplasty. Five days later the patient experienced premature rupture of membranes, which was managed with emergency cesarean section (C-section) - no complications were encountered and a healthy 2300 g female was successfully delivered.

The significant degree of displacement (grade IV) of the fracture lasting over one week precluded open reduction with internal fixation due to fears of femoral head necrosis. During our literature review, we encountered a similar case of femoral neck fracture with grade IV displacement that was treated with open reduction internal fixation - despite restoration of blood flow to the femoral head within 15 hours, the authors still encountered femoral head necrosis with collapse six months later []. Given the considerable delay between symptom presentation and treatment, we decided the case warrants total hip arthroplasty instead of native hip salvage. Hemiarthroplasty was considered but was ultimately discarded as the conversion rate to total hip arthroplasty in young patients remain relatively high and the fracture was subsequently treated with a total uncemented prosthesis (Figure ), consisting of a 50 mm cup with 32 mm ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene insert and a 32 mm head with a 4 mm ceramic insert (Link Inc., Hamburg, Germany). Postoperative radiography confirmed prosthesis placement (Figure ); antibiotic and anticoagulant prophylaxis was initiated with ampicillin/sulbactam and enoxaparin sodium, respectively.\nThree days after the intervention the patient developed moderate abdominal pain without fever and accelerated intestinal transit, which both worsened over the next four days. Given the clinical presentation, there was a high index of suspicion for infection with Clostridium difficile (C. diff), although the diagnosis was ambiguous as the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the C. diff-specific antigen glutamate dehydrogenase was positive, while EIA for exotoxin A and B were negative. Due to exacerbation of symptoms and development of moderate hypokalemia (2.9 mEq/L), empiric treatment with metronidazole was began and marked rapid improvement. The patient was discharged five days later.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 21-year-old male patient came to the hospital with complaints of fever, vomiting, pain in the abdomen, headache, and myalgia for three days. The patient was apparently alright three days ago when he started complaining of fever that was sudden in onset, intermittent, without diurnal variation, and not associated with chills or rigors. The fever was temporarily relived with antipyretics. He also had generalized weakness and joint pain associated with fever.\nThe patient also complained of pain in the abdomen for three days. The pain was diffuse, present in the epigastrium and umbilical region, and aggravated after consumption of food. It was associated with nausea and vomiting. The patient had around four to five episodes of vomiting after food every day. Vomitus contained food particles. There was no hematemesis. The patient was nonalcoholic.\nOn examination, his pulse rate was 88 beats per minute, blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg in the right arm in the supine position, and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. On abdominal examination, there was tenderness in the umbilical area. Heart sounds were normal, no murmur was heard, normal breath sounds were heard, and there was no focal neurological deficit.\nOn investigation, the patient tested positive for nonstructural antigen 1 for dengue fever. Platelets on admission were 53000/mm3, which gradually decreased until the fifth day after admission and then progressively increased (Table ). The patient\u2019s serum amylase and lipase were found to be raised.\nUltrasonography of the abdomen showed a bulky pancreas without ascites. Following this, contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen was done, which revealed bulging of the uncinate process of the pancreas and peripancreatic fluid collection along with minimal ascites (Figure ). These features were suggestive of acute pancreatitis with a score of 2/10 (mild) as per the revised Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis [].\nThe patient was kept nil by mouth and was treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics (ceftriaxone and doxycycline), antipyretics, opioids, and proton pump inhibitors. During the course of the hospital stay, the patient improved gradually along with an increase in platelet count. The patient did not require any platelet transfusion. Along with the improvement in hematological parameters, there was a decrease in amylase and lipase levels.

{"clinical_note": "A 59-year-old female patient presented to a plastic surgery clinic with a lump on her right medial thigh. She noticed the lump eight months ago and it was gradually increasing in size. It was painless initially; however, the lump gradually became tender. The patient was otherwise fit and well with no co-existing morbidities. Closer examination of the right thigh revealed a high consistency mass, with reduced mobility. There was no right inguinal lymphadenopathy or lymph nodes enlargement.\nLaboratory blood tests were unremarkable. An MRI scan was requested to further assess the mass, which was irregular but well-defined in the medial compartment of the thigh, measuring 8.2 x 6.6 x 4.3 cm in size. The mass showed an intermediate signal on both T1 and T2-weighted imaging, appearing hyperintense compared to the adjacent muscular tissue, which also persisted on fat-suppressed imaging. The mass invaded the intramuscular fat planes and caused compression and displacement of the adductor muscles. There was no evidence of intra-muscular invasion. Normal cortical outline and medullary signal intensity of the femur were seen in the right thigh. There was no evidence of bone contusion, marrow oedema, fracture line, or cortical discontinuity. Other muscles of the thigh had a normal outline and signal intensity with no evidence of focal or diffuse oedema. Neurovascular structures were unremarkable. Overall, MRI findings were suggestive of soft tissue neoplasm, with a possibility of a neurogenic tumour. A wide excisional biopsy was then performed to further assess the tissue histologically by the pathologist and confirm the diagnosis. The removed mass measuring 8.5 x 6.5 x 5.4 cm and is shown in Figure . The mass had a smooth outer surface and a soft consistency. The cut surface showed a homogenous tan-white appearance with some slit-like spaces and occasional haemorrhagic spots. Multiple sections were processed for histopathological examination from different planes.\nHistopathology of the mass revealed a tumour arranged in sheets and fascicles composed of round to oval cells along with variably sized adipocytes (Figure ). Numerous interspersed lipoblasts with indented nuclei were also seen. Moreover, severe nuclear atypia was noted including bizarre cells (Figure and Figure ). An area of necrosis was seen with a few areas, which showed malignant and fibrous histiocytoma-like features. Furthermore, a few thin-walled dilated and congested blood vessels were also noted. Also, brisk mitosis was noted (35-38 per 10 HPF) (Figure ). Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) was also performed and the tumour cells were diffusely positive for vimentin and focally positive for S-100; while negative for creatine kinase (CK), smooth muscle antigen (SMA), desmin, CD34 and MyoD1. Overall, the pathological findings are all suggestive features of a high-grade sarcoma, favouring the epithelioid variant of PLS.\nThe patient was also referred to the Department of Nuclear Medicine & Molecular Imaging for post-surgical restaging and assessment for possible metastases using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) scan. The abdominopelvic section showed the liver measuring within normal limits; however, the scan revealed an ill-defined hypermetabolic hypodense lesion seen involving segment VI measuring approximately 2.8 x 1.8 cm suggestive of hepatic metastases with concurrent fatty liver. The scan was also remarkable for the musculoskeletal system, revealing multiple hypermetabolic osseous lesions involving the skull base, right iliac bone, and few vertebrae (predominantly T7-L1); which was suggestive of skeletal metastases. A non-hypermetabolic pulmonary nodule in the right lung field was also detected; it was considered to be likely benign, but interval scanning is suggested to monitor further progress. Finally, there was also evidence of diffuse subtle hypermetabolism at the site of surgery which is suggestive of postsurgical inflammatory sequelae; however, microscopic residual disease cannot be completely ruled out. These multi-organ lesions were due to be biopsied to examine their immunohistochemical findings to confirm metastatic lesions of primary pleiomorphic liposarcoma.

{"clinical_note": "A 71-year-old man initially presented to clinic with right hip and low back pain with radiation to his posterior right thigh. He denied numbness, tingling, and weakness of his bilateral lower extremities. He had reproducible pain in the right SI joint region after SI joint provocative testing. A radiographic spine survey was unrevealing for a structural source of low back pain or radiculopathy. Preoperative imaging, including MRI, did reveal lumbarization of the S1 vertebra, mammillary bodies in the alar region, and a residual S1-S2 disc (Figure , ). After obtaining adequate pain relief from two separate right-sided SI joint injections, the patient decided to pursue surgical intervention in the form of SI joint fusion using the iFuse implant System\u00ae (SI-Bone, Inc., Santa Clara, California).\nIn the operating room, the patient underwent general anesthesia and was positioned prone on the Jackson table. He was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Fluoroscopy was used to mark the borders of the sacrum on the patient\u2019s skin. Next, a 3 cm incision was made parallel to the sacrum beginning over the center of the S2 vertebral body as approximated with lateral fluoroscopy. The incision was carried down through the gluteal fascia. The first implant was placed within the S2 body caudal to the level of the residual S1-S2 disc on the lateral radiograph. The mid-S2 body was chosen as the site for the first implant in an effort to avoid iatrogenic L5 nerve root damage from starting more cranial due to the known sacral dysmorphism seen on preoperative imaging. The next pin was placed caudal to the first using a double-barrel guide. After the path for the second implant was broached, there was an immediate flow of bright red blood from the wound. The second implant was quickly inserted, and the bleeding stopped. Therefore, we decided to proceed with the third implant (Figure ). The third implant was then placed, and the wound was irrigated and closed without evidence of continued bleeding. The patient was discharged home the same day in stable condition.\nOn postoperative day 19, the patient presented to the emergency room with a three-day history of pain in the right gluteal and posterior thigh regions. He also complained of dizziness and occasional syncope when ambulating. Physical exam revealed a well-healed surgical incision with a large bruise extending from his right hip down the right leg (Figure ). CT of the pelvis showed a large gluteal hematoma with extension into the posterior compartment of the thigh (Figure ). CT angiogram (CTA) of the right lower extremity showed disruption of the blood flow through the superior gluteal artery at the level of the inferior two implants as the vessel exited the greater sciatic notch (Figure ). Interventional radiology was consulted for possible embolization, but they determined there was no visible active extravasation and recommended observation and serial hemoglobin draws. The patient\u2019s hemoglobin on the day of presentation was 9.8 g/dL, and on hospital day one it was 8.5 g/dL. Due to this drop in hemoglobin over 24 hours and the patient\u2019s increasing pain level, the decision was made to take the patient to the operating room for exploration and removal of hematoma.\nThe patient was placed in a left lateral decubitus position, and a curved incision was made over the right posterolateral hip for a Kocher-Langenbach approach. Electrocautery dissection was taken down to the level of gluteus maximus muscle fascia. The fascia was carefully incised, and the hematoma was progressively evacuated from under the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius planes. After evacuation, the greater trochanter became palpable. Once the surgical bed was cleared of hematoma, the SGA was identified. A branch of the SGA was noted to have been lacerated with active bleeding (Figure ). The vessel was clamped and ligated using 3-0 silk sutures. A 15-French subfascial Jackson Pratt drain was placed at the end of the procedure. On postoperative day three, he was discharged in improved condition. His surgical drain was removed at the three-week postoperative visit. At his two-month follow-up visit, the patient\u2019s right-sided SI joint pain was gone. At four months, the patient was walking unassisted and was not requiring pain medicines.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Three months prior to her presentation, she had been experiencing progressively worsening confusion and respiratory distress. According to her family, she became bed-bound approximately a week before admission, when she was brought in by ambulance after being found unresponsive by family members.\nOn admission, her vital signs were unremarkable with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute. Her physical examination was significant for lethargy, facial swelling, macroglossia, and bibasilar crackles of the lung fields. Laboratory findings were pertinent for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at 58.5 ng/dL and free thyroxine (T4) of 0.19 ng/dL. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltage QRS complexes with electrical alternans (Figure ). The enlarged cardiac silhouette was noted on chest radiography (CXR) along with congested lung fields (Figure ). Following consultation with the endocrinology service, the patient was started on intravenous levothyroxine and hydrocortisone and admitted to medicine telemetry service for further management.\nOn the following day, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a large pericardial effusion with the swinging of the heart in the pericardial sac with the diastolic collapse of both atria and the right ventricle (Figure , Figure , Figure ). The patient was upgraded to Cardiac ICU and underwent urgent pericardiocentesis with 1300 mL serous straw-colored fluid drained. Analysis of pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells. Acid-fast bacilli stain and culture were negative. The patient was discharged on levothyroxine. Serial TSH and T4 measurements over the subsequent two months showed normalization of both values.

Diarrhea was associated with severe, diffuse, waxing, and waning abdominal cramps, which were noted to improve after emesis. No correlation was noted with eating habits and no history of recent antibiotic use was reported. On examination, the abdomen was soft but tender on deep palpation, with audible bowel sounds. No organomegaly or costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness was appreciated.\nInitial laboratory results revealed hypokalemia (3.3 mEq/L), lipase within normal limits (32 U/L), and normal transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]: 19 U/L; alanine aminotransferase [ALT]: 10 U/L) and bilirubin (total bilirubin: 0.7 mg/dl; direct bilirubin: 0.1 mb/dl). Stool studies were unremarkable and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was negative.

Five days after the development of initial symptoms, productive cough with orange-colored sputum began. His condition worsened four days before presentation, with the development of fever, chills, night sweats, significant diarrhea, emesis, and pleuritic chest pain. On initial presentation, the patient appeared ill and anxious. He was febrile with a temperature of 102\u00b0 Fahrenheit, tachycardic with a heart rate of 118 beats per minute, and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 109/54 mmHg. On physical exam, he had a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. His neck was supple with absent lymphadenopathy and both lungs were clear to auscultation. Laboratory work on admission was remarkable for a leukocyte count of 23.2 x 10^9/Liter, a neutrophil count of 85.6% with 16% bands, serum sodium of 132 mmol/Liter, and a D-Dimer of 4.29 mg/L FEU. Initially, one gram of ceftriaxone and 500 mg of azithromycin were administered intravenously in the ED. Tests were then ordered including a monospot and rapid Streptococcus A antigen via pharyngeal swab, as well as (1,3)-beta-D-glucan and HIV-1 RNA via serum, and Legionella pneumophila urine antigen; all without remarkable findings. A complete viral respiratory panel was negative, and PCR did not detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae, SARS-CoV-2, or Chlamydia pneumoniae. A portable chest X-Ray performed in the ED demonstrated right upper lobe pneumonia (Figure 1). A CT angiogram of the chest ordered to rule out pulmonary embolus (Figures -) demonstrated no signs of acute pulmonary emboli. However, findings displayed a large consolidation in the right lower lobe and a 4 cm cavitation in the left lower lobe. Transthoracic ECG was then performed, demonstrating no vegetations or valvular abnormalities. Trans-esophageal ECG was recommended to the patient, but he declined. Next, a CT scan of the neck was ordered, showing no evidence of abnormalities. Without significant improvement in WBC count for three days and persistent fevers >100\u00b0 Fahrenheit, his antibiotic regimen was escalated to three grams of ampicillin-sulbactam administered intravenously every six hours.

{"clinical_note": "A 21-year-old Danish man diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescence, which was currently untreated, was involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric ward by the police in an agitated and aggressive state after a violent conflict with his parents. Clinically, the patient\u2019s state was compatible with acute intoxication, and the patient confirmed \u201cdrug intake,\u201d but quantification could not be specified at admission. Eight months prior, the patient had spent 2 weeks in deep propofol sedation at an intensive care unit (ICU) with acute organic delirium due to GHB withdrawal.\nAt the psychiatric ward, the patient\u2019s threatening and aggressive behavior intensified. To avoid violent incidents, the patient was subjected to physical restraint (abdominal belt) and tablet lorazepam 4 mg was administered twice. The patient was disorientated, started expressing paranoid ideas, and developed diaphoresis, tachycardia (heart rate 130 beats per min), and hyperthermia (37.8 \u00b0C, tympanic). Because he started biting the metal locks on his abdominal belt, his hands and feet were also restrained.\nOn the second day, the patient was diagnosed with acute organic delirium caused by GHB withdrawal and treatment was initiated. In accordance with ICD-102, the diagnosis was based upon the clinical presentation in combination with a history of GHB substance abuse. The patient was treated with a cumulative dose of 300 mg diazepam (40 mg as oral administration and 260 mg intravenously), without induction of sleep. To obtain sedation the restrained patient was transferred to the ICU, where he was intubated and sedated with intravenous infusions of propofol (up to 16 mg/kg/hour) and sufentanil (up to 100 \u03bcg/hour).\nOn days 3\u20136, the patient remained deeply sedated and on mechanical ventilation. To counteract potential withdrawal symptoms, clonidine 225 \u03bcg was administered every 6 hours via a nasogastric tube (NG tube), intravenous diazepam 20 mg every 5 hours, and continuous midazolam infusions (up to 1 mg/kg/hour). To prevent Wernicke encephalopathy, intravenous thiamine 200 mg and vitamin B 2 ml solution were given. Due to elevated C-reactive protein (64 mg/L) and white blood cell count (leukocytes 12.2 \u00d7 109/L; neutrophils 9.1 \u00d7 109/L), empiric treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam 4 g every 6 hours was initiated.\nOn day 6, a first wake-up call was attempted. However, upon awakening the patient was disoriented and severely agitated, and he was readily reintubated and resedated. The psychopharmacological treatment was intensified with olanzapine 20 mg/day (via NG-tube), intravenous diazepam 40 mg every 5 hours, clonidine 225 \u03bcg every 6 hours (via NG-tube), and continuous midazolam infusions (up to 1 mg/kg/hour).\nOn days 7\u20139, the intravenous diazepam was increased to 60 mg every 5 hours, and to supplement the propofol sedation, methadone 10 mg twice a day (via NG-tube) was initiated.\nOn day 10, a second wake-up was attempted. Again, the patient was disoriented, reported of ants crawling in the room, and presented with severe agitation. Physical restraints were reinstated and intravenous haloperidol 30 mg/day was added.\nOn day 11, the psychiatrists decided to initiate bilateral frontotemporal ECT as \u201cen bloc\u201d treatment, that is ECT on three consecutive days. Medication status during the three en bloc ECTs was: olanzapine 20 mg twice a day (BID, via NG-tube), methadone 10 mg BID (via NG-tube), intravenous phenobarbital 100 mg every 4 hours, pregabalin 150 mg BID (via NG-tube), haloperidol 5 mg as needed (PRN), up to 50 mg a day, clonidine 225 mg every 6 hours (via NG-tube), and continuous infusions of midazolam (up to 1 mg/kg/hour). Because treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines with long half-lives could compromise seizure induction, the starting ECT dose was set at the maximal energy of 200% (1008 mC) along with intravenous flumazenil 0.4 mg. The ECT series are shown in Fig. .\nOn day 12, the first ECT was administered (ECT #1A). Due to an administrative error, flumazenil was not administered, and restimulation with concurrent flumazenil was performed (ECT #1B). After ECT, the patient remained awake although clinically unchanged.\nOn day 13, the second ECT was administered (ECT #2). Subsequently, the patient\u2019s level of agitation decreased, he briefly responded adequately to verbal communication and sleep improved.\nOn day 14, the third ECT (ECT #3A) was administered. Due to seizure at threshold level, restimulation after hyperventilation was performed (ECT #3B). The patient was less agitated and engaged in brief conversations. Haloperidol was increased to 20 mg every 6 hours. On day 15, 50 mg hydroxyzine once a day (QD) was added.\nOn day 16, agitation had completely subsided, restraints were removed, and the patient cooperated with the remaining treatment.\nOn day 17, the fourth ECT was administered (ECT #4). On day 18, the patient displayed no neurological or psychiatric symptoms, all sedatives and psychopharmacological treatment were discontinued, and he was transferred to a general internal medicine ward.\nOn day 19, the patient was still in complete remission, and he insisted on discharge. Upon discharge the patient confirmed daily use of GHB and cocaine prior to hospitalization, and he provided oral and written consent to report his case in the medical literature.

Two weeks prior to admission, she had symptoms of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea which was later diagnosed to be amebiasis. The patient was diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis at the age of 6 months when she developed arrhythmia related to a cardiac rhabdomyoma. The rest of the medical history included adenoma sebaceum, Ash leaf spots, bilateral renal angiomyolipomas, left-sided retinal hamartoma, and allergic rhinitis. She was previously operated 3 times for the removal of multiple renal angiomyolipomas and underwent partial cystectomy due to invasion of the tumor. Physical examination was normal. The laboratory work-up was unremarkable except for anemia (hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL) and an elevated C-reactive protein value of 125 mg/dL. The computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed extralumination of the rectal contrast material at the rectosigmoid region, indicating bowel perforation. The patient underwent proctosigmoidectomy and formation of an end colostomy together with the closure of the anorectal stump (Hartmann operation). Two weeks after the operation, the patient developed a new onset abdominal pain. The CT scan revealed contrast extralumination in the distal ileum and the patient underwent ileocecal resection due to a new onset bowel perforation and severe adhesions. Several days after the second operation she developed fever and was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection for which she took treatment. Both of the rectosigmoid resection specimen and the ileocecal resection specimen were reported as leiomyomatosis-like lymphangioleiomyomatosis (Fig. ). After 8 months of follow-up, the patient's rectoscopic examination together with a control CT scan was normal. At the first year of follow-up, the patient had an ileostomy closure surgery.\nGrossly, the rectosigmoid specimen (16 cm in length, 7 cm in width, 1 cm in thickness) consisted of full-thickness hemorrhage extending 7 cm proximally from the surgical margin. Macroscopically, there was a 3 cm perforation area in the central part of this hemorrhagic region. Pseudopolypoid lesions ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 cm in diameter were observed in the surrounding mucosa. The ileocecal resection material (ileum 4 cm and colon 16 cm in length) consisted of a 5 cm, pale-colored, nodular lesion in the cecum. Numerous pale nodular lesions, ranging from 0.3 to 5 cm in diameter extending from the mucosa to the subserosa were observed in the cecum. In all resected specimens, the intestinal wall was diffusely thickened and nodular. Infiltration into the subserosal adipose tissue was observed.\nHistological examination revealed nodular lesions with an extensive growth pattern, extending from the submucosa to the mesorectal adipose tissue in some areas, without affecting the mucosa. Microscopically, the nodules consisted of spindle cell bundles with prominent elongated nuclei organized into branching short fascicles (Fig. ). Necrosis, pleomorphism, and mitotic activity were not observed. Among the spindle cells, clusters of epithelioid cells were observed around dilated vascular structures lined with endothelium in some areas (Fig. ). It was noted that these epithelioid cell assemblages in the vessel walls tended to merge with the surrounding lymphatics. Mature adipose tissue was not observed. In the surrounding intestine where the tumor was absent, severe active colitis findings were observed. Immunohistochemically, the spindle and epithelioid cells in both of the resected specimens stained positive for desmin, SMA, and HMB45 and negative for CD34, DOG-1, c-KIT, S100, ER, and PR (Fig. ).

Severe L4-5 central stenosis and root redundancy were diagnosed on lumbar MRI (Fig. ).\nOn February 28, 2018, we performed L4-5 OLIF, followed by bilateral L4 laminotomy and L4-5 percutaneous posterior screw fixation (PPSF). To perform OLIF first, after administering general anesthesia, we ensured that the hip joint was not flexed in the standard right posture. The axilla and hip were fixed using a wide cloth and tape. The external oblique, internal oblique, and transverse abdominal muscles were incised and approached through the retroperitoneum to gently retract the abdominal organs and psoas to expose the intervertebral space. There was no direct blood vessel injury or nerve injury during this process. After determining the height and length of the cage using the C-arm, we vertically inserted a cage (Clydesdale DLIF Cage, 6\u00b0\u221714\u221750 mm; Sofamor, Memphis) combined with a demineralized bone matrix into the intervertebral space. After turning the patient to the prone position, bilateral laminotomy was performed, with minimal damage to the posterior tension band, and severe ligamentum flavum hypertrophy was confirmed and removed. Thereafter, L4-5 PPSF was performed.\nIntraoperatively, an increase in the disc height and foramen height was confirmed using the C-arm, and sagittal alignment was maintained well. There was no motor weakness postoperatively. Two days later, the patient was allowed to walk while wearing an orthosis, and the radiating pain improved; he was then discharged from the hospital.\nAt 6 weeks after surgery, he complained of pain and swelling below both ankles at the outpatient clinic. Lumbar CT and radiographic examination showed that the fusion was maintained without subsidence of the surgical site, the height of the intervertebral disc space and foramen increased, and there was no abnormality in the alignment between the lumbar vertebrae (Fig. ). In addition, a prominently protruding osteophyte, which was considered insignificant before the first surgery, was again observed. In particular, the osteophytes on the foraminal side were severely protruding (Fig. ). In the 10th week after surgery, he visited the outpatient clinic with a cane, complaining of persistent pain below both ankles and motor weakness of the right ankle. A marked decrease in dorsiflexion of the right ankle was observed. The Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength grade of the right ankle was 2. We confirmed the resolution of the previous central stenosis and root redundancy on lumbar MRI and found no other specific findings (Fig. ).\nWe thought that it was necessary to explore the L4 nerve roots again, focusing on the right side. On May 21, 2018, we performed right L4/5 facetectomy and foraminotomy to release the right L4 nerve root. During surgery, the tissues compressing the L4 nerve root and the osteophyte protruding severely and trapping the nerve root were identified and removed. Within 1 week of hospitalization after surgery, the radiating pain in both feet disappeared, and dorsiflexion of the right ankle was restored to MRC grade 4. After the second surgery, follow-up CT of the lumbar spine confirmed clear decompression of the right foramen (Fig. ).

{"clinical_note": "An 80-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department of our institution with a 5-day history of headaches. A week ago, she had presented with a minor head trauma that was caused by a fall. She had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia and had experienced focal cerebral infarction 10 years earlier. The patient had no neurologic abnormalities, except for headache. An initial non-contrast brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed a scanty subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on the left ambient cistern with an enlarged ventricle (Fig. A). Subsequent brain CT angiography (CTA) showed no vascular abnormalities. Based on the CT findings and the patient's history of trauma, she was admitted to the neurosurgery department as a suspected case of traumatic SAH, following which her symptoms improved gradually. On the 10th day of hospitalization, the patient showed sudden stuporous mental deterioration. Brain CT performed at that time revealed SAH on all the cisterns, with intraventricular hemorrhage (Fig. B). A CTA performed immediately after the procedure revealed no definitive cerebral aneurysm on 3-dimensional reconstruction images, but a suspicious aneurysmal lesion was seen in the distal PICA in the thin axial CTA image (Fig. C). Subsequent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a bilobulated distal PICA aneurysm, and an endovascular treatment was planned (Fig. A). Coil embolization was performed under general anesthesia. After a right femoral artery puncture, the left vertebral artery (VA) was not visible on left subclavian angiography; therefore, a 6-Fr soft, torqueable catheter optimized for intracranial access (SOFIA; MicroVention Terumo, Tustin, CA) was advanced into the V4 segment of the right VA under roadmap guidance. Subsequently, we attempted to reach the Headway 17 microcatheter (MicroVention Terumo, Tustin, CA) into the aneurysmal sac, but it failed due to the acute angle of the vertebra\u2013PICA junction. Therefore, after deploying the coil in the VA just before the PICA origin, we planned to position the microcatheter in the PICA with the support of the coil mass (Fig. B). However, some of the coil masses deployed to the VA migrated upward of the PICA origin unintentionally during the navigation process using a microwire and microcatheter (Fig. C). Therefore, we additionally deployed a coil to the VA and finished the procedure after confirming PICA occlusion (Fig. D). Fortunately, with supportive care in an intensive care unit after the procedure, the patient recovered fully, and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed no definitive acute cerebral infarction in the PICA territory. One year after embolization, a follow-up angiography was performed, which revealed recanalization of the right PICA with normal arterial configuration, and no aneurysmal sacs were observed in the distal PICA. The recanalized VA was located medial to the deployed coil mass (Fig. E).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "An 8-year-old Chinese boy with no specific family or psychosocial history was admitted to our hospital with an emergency occurrence of purpura, severe hematemesis, large bloody stools, and sharp abdominal pain. His symptoms had begun 2 weeks prior to admission, with abdominal pain and an erythematous pinpoint rash on his arms. The rash developed from his upper limbs (opisthenar and arms) to his lower limbs. Laboratory examination in the outpatient clinic revealed no abnormalities in indicators such as white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin. After oral medication (specific unknown), his abdominal symptoms began to reduce, as did the purpura. Ten days prior, the rash progressed mostly on the legs, and he experienced deeper abdominal pain in the form of persistent pain with abdominal gassiness and emesis. He was admitted to another hospital with a diagnosis of HSP. Seven days prior, he had melena. After fasting and fluid replacement, there was no obvious improvement in the symptoms. Half a day prior, his face and lips appeared pale, and he had increased abdominal pain, accompanied by numerous bloody stools and hematemesis. He was immediately treated with methylprednisolone, posterior pituitary injection, somatostatin, and hemocoagulase, together with the infusion of large blood products (Table ). At this stage, the patient still produced large amounts of blood in the vomit and stool. His vital signs were extremely unstable, and he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of our hospital. The patient had purpura with lower limb predominance and abdominal pain (consistent with one of the following 4 criteria: abdominal pain, histopathology, arthritis or arthralgia, and renal involvement), and was diagnosed with HSP.[\nOn admission, he had severe anemia, with a blood pressure of 76/44 mm Hg, pulse of 135 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min. There was also a palpable purpura rash on both legs, tenderness in the abdomen, and absence of bowel sounds. Routine blood examination revealed a hemoglobin level of 70 g/L, white blood cell count of 11.48 \u00d7 109/L, and platelet count of 13 \u00d7 109/L. The liver function test showed albumin 10 g/L. The serum electrolytes showed sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 2.92 mmol/L, chloride 112.1 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 15.9 mmol/L (Table ) with coagulopathy. Therefore, HSP complicated with an alimentary tract hemorrhage was diagnosed. He was immediately treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg per day), infusion of blood products, and somatostatin but after 2 days after treatment (day 3), he still had massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, poor circulation, a reduced level of consciousness, and unstable vital signs. Abdominal ultrasonography and plain abdominal radiography revealed no enterobrosis. The patient was also evaluated by pediatric surgeons, and the continuation of medical treatment was suggested. However, his condition deteriorated, and he needed to rely on a life-supporting blood transfusion. He developed signs of peritonitis with abdominal distension. Gastrointestinal tract perforation was suspected. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the whole abdomen revealed curved liquid samples and gas shadows on the left and front of the stomach, supporting the possibility of gastrointestinal tract perforation (Fig. ). On day 4, an emergency laparotomy was performed. The surgery revealed that the anterior wall of the descending duodenum was thinner with a 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm diameter perforation, and the posterior wall had a 3 cm \u00d7 1 cm ulcer, which had penetrated into the peritoneum of the pancreas and experienced active bleeding from the broken end of the vessel. The intraoperative hemorrhage volume was approximately 3000 mL, including intragastric bleeding and intestinal blood clots. Pathological examination indicated chronic inflammation of the intestinal wall mucosa in the descending part of the stomach and duodenum, with hemorrhage, ulceration, interstitial congestion, and edema. Immunofluorescence microscopy of paraffin sections showed granular and lumpy IgA focal deposition in the blood vessel walls (Fig. ). Postoperatively, he was administered nasal continuous positive airway pressure-assisted ventilation, anti-infection treatment, albumin transfusion, platelet transfusion, abdominal drainage, methylprednisolone, fluconazole antifungal treatment, and wound dressing. The general symptoms gradually improved, vital signs were stable, and abdominal pain was relieved. The drainage tube was assessed after discharge, the abdominal CT was repeated after 1 month and the duodenostomy tube was removed 50 days after surgery.

{"clinical_note": "A 42-year-old man was admitted to emergency service after a ski injury. He was unable to weight-bear. Effusion of the knee, severe posterior knee pain, and tenderness of the posterior structures of the knee were determined in the initial physical examination. The pain was getting worse when the knee was extended. The range of motion (ROM) was very limited, and the motion itself was causing the patient a lot of pain. The patient did not allow the tests Lachmann, McMurray, or posterior drawer to be performed due to pain and spasm. There were no findings of neurovascular damage.\nTwo avulsed fragments were revealed in the plain radiographs (Fig. A&B). MRI showed the fragments belonged to PCL and lateral meniscus, and concomitant avulsion fractures of the medial meniscus and PCL were diagnosed (Fig. ). ACL, lateral meniscus and medial/lateral collateral ligaments were intact. Based on these radiological and clinical findings, and due to the instability and locking risk that simultaneous PCL and medial meniscus avulsion fracture would create in the knee, the patient was recommended to operate.\nThe operation was performed the day after the injury. Under general anesthesia, physical examination was performed again, and the posterior drawer test was positive with a soft endpoint. Lachmann test was negative, and valgus stress test when the knee flexed 30\u00b0 was positive as grade I laxity (opening of the medial joint <5 mm). Varus/valgus stress radiographs were performed under fluoroscopy, and medial space opening was checked and confirmed.\nThen the patient was placed in the prone position, and a tourniquet was applied and inflated. An L-shaped incision was made over the fossa poplitea. Dissection was performed, and the interval between the semimembranosus and medial head of the gastrocnemius was used, as described by Burks and Schaffer.[ At that point, a varicose vein that enlarged and curved, that we thought it was caused by trauma, was detected over the capsule; a cardiovascular surgeon was attended to the surgery and ligated the veins (Fig. A). And then gastrocnemius muscle was retracted laterally, and the posterior capsule was exposed. The avulsed bone fragments were palpated over the capsule, and a vertical capsular incision between these fragments was made (Fig. B). After removing the bone clots and soft tissues around the avulsed fragments, bone beds were prepared. Firstly, the medial meniscus's avulsion fracture was reducted and fixed with two Kirschner wires temporarily, and then PCL avulsion fracture was reducted in the same way under fluoroscopy control. Later, permanent fixation of the avulsion fracture of the medial meniscus was done with two headless 3.0 mm compression screws after drilling and measurement (Fig. C). Then, the PCL avulsion fracture was fixed with a 4.0 mm partially threaded, cannulated, cancellous screw with a washer (Fig. D). The fixation of the fragments was confirmed under fluoroscopy again, and the posterior drawer test was performed gently to check stability. After the irrigation of the wound, the capsule, subcutaneous layers, and skin was closed. A hinged, long leg brace was applied and locked in 0\u00b0 knee extension.\nThe knee was kept in full extension with the hinged brace for two weeks and instructed for leg raises only in the brace several times daily. On the third week, isometric and passive ROM exercises with continuous passive motion device were applied and gradually increased as tolerated. Weight-bearing was not allowed for six weeks. At postoperative controls, knee X-rays were taken, and fracture healing was followed (Fig. C&D). No complications were encountered in the follow-up of the patient. Full weight-bearing and ROM without pain were achieved in the third month after the operation. The visual analog scale score was 8 before surgery and 2 in the third month after the surgery.

Spherical equivalent refraction was \u201310.5 diopters and \u201314.0 diopters in the right and left eyes, respectively. The intraocular pressure was 18 and 16 mm Hg in the right and left eyes, respectively. Slit-lamp examination showed a slight nuclear cataract of grade 1 in both eyes, based on Emery-Little classification. Fundus examination revealed tigroid fundus in both eyes, and a white, well-defined, and patchy lesion at the superonasal to the fovea in the left eye (Fig. A). Autofluorescence showed hypofluorescence area in the macula. This is consistent with the aforementioned lesion in the left eye (Fig. B).\nUpon applying OCT to the vertical section through the fovea, the sclera curved posteriorly at the location superonasal to the fovea, and the choroid was thickened in the area (Fig. C). Additionally, the ellipsoid zone (EZ) was disrupted in the area between the fovea and the curved sclera. Horizontal volume scans of the OCT through the patchy lesion also showed posterior curvature of the sclera, thinning of the outer retina, and disappearance of the RPE\u2013Bruch's membrane complex, resulting in a pseudo-fovea appearance (Fig. D). Another horizontal volume scan of the OCT demonstrated a connection of blood vessels running from the sclera to the choroid (Fig. E). There was no obvious connection between the vitreous cavity and the superior choroidal cavity with OCT; taken together, we diagnosed this case as PCA with macular ICC.\nDuring a 4-year follow up, the white patchy lesion in the fundus and the hypofluorescence region determined by autofluorescence gradually expanded, especially toward the optic disc (Fig. A and B). The BCVA in the left eye decreased with the expansion of the lesion and was 20/100 at the final visit. OCT through the fovea showed that the disrupted EZ expanded toward the ICC and the sensory retina of the fovea became thinner with time (Fig. C).

He had previously been treated with antibiotics (cephalosporin and azithromycin) over 10 days. However, the symptoms continued. A detailed medical history revealed that he had an episode of pulmonary cryptococcosis 5 years ago (Fig. A). He recovered without any treatment and became asymptomatic. He has chronic HBV infection and is undergoing long-term treatment with entecavir. In addition, exposure to bird droppings was reported.\nComputed tomography (CT) performed at admission revealed multiple areas of consolidations and ground-glass shadows of bilateral lung fields (Fig. B). Chest auscultation demonstrated crude lung respiratory sounds and no evidence of dry and moist rales.

{"clinical_note": "A 45-year-old man (occupation: medical doctor) visited a university hospital with a chief complaint of fainting 1 day back. He had no history of medical problems and was not taking any medications. He had hiked 4 to 5 times a week for 2 years. Syncope occurred while hiking on a cold winter night (temperature: \u22128\u00b0C). He fainted while resting for a while in a standing position after hiking at a fast speed for an hour. The witness reported that he lost consciousness for about 1 minutes, and no head strike or seizure-like activity was observed. Upon awakening from syncope, the patient had no syncope recollection. After syncope, the patient did not have any illnesses or symptoms, such as headache, cognitive deficits, or somnolence. He had no prior episodes of syncope or fainting.\nAt the time of examination (the day after the syncope), his blood pressure was 122/77 mm Hg, and his resting heart rate was 75 beats per minute. Electrocardiogram, 24 hours ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring, echocardiogram, tilt table test, and exercise tolerance test showed no abnormal findings. In addition, in conventional brain and chest computed tomography and brain MRI, no abnormalities were observed. All blood test results, such as electrolyte level, hemoglobin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level, were normal. In the physical examination, he did not show any neurological symptoms, including motor, sensory, or cognitive deficits (Mini-Mental State Exam: full marks, no patient's subjective symptoms). The deep tendon reflex was normoactive in all the extremities. Based on the patient's history and examination results, the cardiologist diagnosed the patient with transient loss of consciousness due to syncope. In addition, considering that syncope occurred during excessive physical activity at cold temperatures, the possibility of vasovagal syncope was thought to be high.\nDCE scans were acquired using a 3T system (Skyra, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). In addition to the patient, a DCE scan was obtained from a healthy control participant (42-year-old man) who volunteered for the study. Seven pre-contrast sets of DCE-MRI (echo time= 1.92 ms, repetition time= 5.46 ms, the field of view = 230 \u00d7 135 mm2, matrix size of 256 \u00d7 150, and slice thickness of 3 mm), followed by an additional 114 sets under the intravenous injection of contrast agent were imaged in axial view. The permeability (Ktrans) of the mid-slice was calculated using the Patlak model.[\nHere, t indicates the time step, \u03c4 indicates the variable of integration, Vp indicates the volume of plasma, and Ct (t) and Cp (t) indicate the temporal variation of the concentration of the contrast agent in the tissue and plasma, respectively. A circular region of interest (ROI) with an inner diameter of 1 to 2 cm was located at the superior sagittal sinus, which has higher consistency and plausibility compared to the internal carotid artery or the arterial vessel closest to the lesion.[ In the axial image where the body and crus of the fornix were presented, 10 round random ROIs of 2 cm diameter (dotted circles in Fig. ) were selected (5 in each hemisphere) to quantify the overall averaged Ktrans of the brain. ROIs were depicted, including sulci in which the bright blue colored lines (BBB disruption) are presented.\nFor the quantitative analysis, in each ROI of the healthy control participants and the patients, the T2 and Ktrans values were measured. The differences in the measured values between the healthy controls and patients were compared using an independent t-test. Statistical significance was set at P < .05.\nIn the conventional MRIs of the healthy control and the patient, no lesions were observed (Fig. A, 1B). In addition, in the Ktrans map of DCE MRI of healthy control participants, no specific abnormal findings were observed (Fig. C). However, in the patient, bright blue-colored lines were observed within the sulci throughout the cerebral cortex (Fig. D). These findings indicate disruption of the BBB of vessels in the overall cerebral sulci. In the quantitative analysis, the averaged T2 intensity (within 10 randomly selected ROIs) of healthy control and patient was 403.95 \u00b1 24.91 (AU) and 404.50 \u00b1 24.21 (AU), which was not statistically different (P = .9625). Here, the average Ktrans of healthy controls within 10 randomly selected ROIs was 0.000156 \u00b1 0.000099 (minutes\u22121) and 0.001067 \u00b1 0.000806 (minutes\u22121) for the patient.

Necrotic tissue was scraped out of the wound with a sterile blade (see extensive muscle necrosis, fat liquefaction, and large amounts of purulent secretions overflowing as in Fig. A) until the wound oozed blood. Then, after rinsing with saline, PRF was injected into the wound and the submerged area, so that the autologous platelet-rich fibrin mixed with the preparation could fully contact with the wound and close the wound, and then covered with oil gauze to keep the wound moist and promote the growth of granulation.

Before the operation, a skilled anesthetist performed routine nasotracheal intubation with a video laryngoscope. The endotracheal tube cuff was filled with 10 mL water to replace air to make inadvertent laser damage to the endotracheal tube cuff more noticeable. During the operation, a saline-soaked absorbent cotton was placed at the subglottis to protect the trachea. There was no evidence of intraoperative damage to the tracheal wall.\nFifteen hours after the operation, the patient experienced sudden dull pain in the anterior neck but no dyspnea. Repeat direct rigid laryngoscopy showed no abnormalities. This patient is considered to be a common throat in TML and discharged from the hospital. At 23 h after initial surgery, she returned to emergency room presenting subcutaneous emphysema and cough.

The patient's condition gradually worsened and manifested with increased step distance and drunk walking from side to side at admission. The patient complained of recent difficulties in eye opening, involuntary tremor of both upper limbs, and catatonia, which were aggravated after activities.\nNeurological examination: Conscious mind, dysarthria, normal memory, calculation and orientation power, normal visual acuity and field of both eyes, free movement of both eyes in all directions, horizontal nystagmus when both eyes look to the left, ptosis of both eyes, unstable and inaccurate bilateral finger-nose test, clumsy bilateral alternating bilateral movements, bilateral heel-knee-shin test, and no bilateral pathological reflex.\nAuxiliary examinations: Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the proband (III-3) showed cerebellar atrophy with no clear abnormal signals. Cervical MRI suggested no atrophy or thinning of the cervical cord (Fig. ).\nFamily surveys: Figure shows the family history of the proband (III-3). The mother (II-3) developed similar symptoms in her 30s, was paralyzed in bed in the following days and died in her 40s. The elderly maternal uncle (II-2) and his children (III-1, III-2) have no clear clinical manifestations. The younger maternal uncle (II-5) began to suffer from illness in his 20s and died from disease in his 30s.\nThe daughter of the younger maternal uncle (III-5) (25-year-old now) gradually had unsteady steps and unclear speech with no obvious incentive at around 20 years old, manifested as a slightly wide step base, unstraight walking, influent speech, and appearance of choking cough in drinking water in the past year (Table ). Neurological examination: conscious mind, dysarthria, horizontal nystagmus when both eyes look to the left and right, active tendon reflex of limbs, unstable and inaccurate bilateral finger-nose test, clumsy bilateral alternating movements, and bilateral heel-knee-shin test. Auxiliary examination: Head magnetic resonance imaging suggested cerebellar atrophy (Fig. ).\nAfter obtaining informed consent from patients and their families, serum samples of the proband (III-3) and his cousin (III-5) were collected to identify genes involved in the pathogenesis of SCA. The blood samples were sent to the Beijing High Trust Diagnostic for Whole Exome Sequencing. Sanger sequencing of the patients (III-3 and III-5) revealed a c.1852A > G missense mutation in the exon region of the AFG3L2 gene, resulting in a lysine-glutamate amino acid substitution (p.K618E) (Figs. and ). Sanger sequencing of the other family members (II-1, III-1) revealed no AFG3L2 mutations. We checked the human gene mutation database and found that the gene mutations reported here had not been reported before. According to ACGS recommended guidelines, we thought this mutation considered pathogenic. SCA28 is the one uniquely caused by a pathogenic variation in the mitochondrial protein AFG3L2. Combined with the clinical manifestations, auxiliary examinations and sequencing results of the patients (III-3 and III-5), the diagnosis of SCA28 was suspected.

Accordingly, after explaining this situation to the patient and his caregivers, a 12 French trocar tube was inserted into the left thoracic cavity of the patient. In order to allow the lungs to expand slowly, natural drainage was performed without suction, and the rubber tube connecting the chest tube and the water seal bottle was partial clamped. On the day after chest tube insertion, there was an finding of air leakage through the chest tube, but the lungs were not found to expand much as a result of chest x-ray (Fig. B), thus the partial clamped rubber tube was de-clamped. However, about an hour after de-clamping, the patient suddenly complained of severe respiratory distress, cough with foamy sputum, and vomiting. Immediately the chest tube was clamped to stop drainage. With oxygen saturation measured 75%, oxygen was administered to the patient via an oxygen mask, but no improvement was observed. In turn, a chest x-ray was followed during additional high flow nasal prong (HFNP) therapy, exhibiting REPE findings such as newly developed ill-defined consolidation in the left lung (Fig. ). Oxygen saturation did not improve even after HFNP therapy, and further, persistent cough with foamy sputum, shortness of breath, and a drop in blood pressure occurred.

{"clinical_note": "A 6-month-old male child was referred to our hospital with a mass on the anterior alveolar ridge of the mandible. The patient's parents noticed this mass at the age of 4 months, which rapidly increased in size thereafter.\nAt his first visit to our hospital, his face was symmetrical, but the lower lip was protruded. A relatively well-defined spherical mass (30 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 20 mm) was located on the mandibular alveolar ridge extending from the right mandibular deciduous canine to the left mandibular first deciduous molar (Fig. ). The mass had normal mucosal color, was elastic hard and non-fluctuant with the left mandibular deciduous central incisor attached to the surface of the tumor.\nComputed tomography (CT) showed a relatively uniform multicentric osteolytic lesion extending from the right mandibular deciduous central incisor to the left mandibular deciduous canine with expansion of the surrounding bone and numerous displaced tooth germs. The density of the lesion mass was lower than that of the muscle, and the boundary with cancellous bone was irregular (Fig. ). Histopathological findings of the biopsy specimen showed that the biphasic tumor cells consisted of large melanin-containing epithelioid cells and small neuroblast-like cells forming a solid alveolar pattern (Fig. A) and a gland-like pattern (Fig. B). The large tumor cells had a slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and an oval bright nucleus with small but distinct nucleoli. These were occasionally positive for melanin pigment, which was visualized in the form of black granules on Fontana-Masson staining (Fig. C) and were bleached with potassium permanganate\u2013oxalic acid (Fig. D). The small tumor cells had a scanty cytoplasm and a slightly deeply stained round nucleus, often showing detached clusters. A small number of mitotic figures, and a low degree of cellular polymorphism were observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the large and small tumor cells were positive for neuron-specific enolase (Fig. A & B). The large tumor cells stained positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), human melanin black-45, and vimentin (Fig. C\u2013E). The small tumor cells stained positive for CD56 and synaptophysin (Fig. F & G). The tumor cells were negative for S-100 (Fig. H) and chromogranin A. The MIB-1 proliferation index was >50% (Fig. I). Based on these findings, the tumor was finally diagnosed as MNTI.\nThe tumor continued to grow rapidly, and marginal mandibulectomy was performed under general anesthesia 28 days after the first visit to our hospital. The extent of resection was determined by referring to the mandibular 3D model which was created based on the CT data obtained before the surgery. Marginal mandibulectomy, approximately 5 mm lateral to the tumor, was successful in preserving the inferior margin of the mandible (Fig. ). The mental foramen on the left side was included in the resection, and the foramen on the right side was preserved. All deciduous tooth germs were included in the excision, except for the right deciduous second molar. After rounding the sharp edges of the bone with a file, the raw surface of the mandible was completely closed by the surrounding soft tissue with help of polydioxanone monofilament synthetic absorbable suture. The postoperative course was uneventful, and oral intake of milk was started 3 days after the operation. On the 7th day after the surgery, the patient was discharged from the hospital with good general condition. At the time of discharge, he had no abnormal facial swelling or infection in the surgical wound.\nSimilar to biopsy specimens, histopathological findings of the excised mass showed that the tumor consisted of 2 types of cells: large polyhedral cells sometimes containing melanin granules and smaller round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scanty cytoplasm resembling lymphocytes. No nuclear atypia or mitosis was observed. Tumor cells were seen invading the surrounding tooth germs and bone.\nThe patient is being closely followed up, and no evidence of recurrence or metastasis was observed on CT images taken 1 year after surgery (Fig. ).

Subsequently, valproate and lacosamide were added 5 and 3 years ago, respectively, due to poor seizure control. During a regular visit, a neurologist noticed that the patient's serum creatinine level increased from 0.98 to 1.29 mg/dL over 6 months. As his serum creatinine level continued to increase to 1.74 mg/dL, he was referred to the nephrology department. He presented no symptoms, and physical examination revealed no abnormal findings. Laboratory analyses showed renal dysfunction, mildly elevated C-reactive protein levels, and increased levels of urinary markers for tubular injury (see Table ). Renal biopsy was performed. Although the glomeruli were intact, there was marked interstitial lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration (Fig. A, B), suggestive of AIN. No immunoglobulin or complement deposition was observed. Since he had no other organ involvement (including uveitis) and no laboratory findings suggestive of autoimmune disorders such as sarcoidosis and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, the AIN was ascribed to drug allergy. Based on a positive result of lymphocyte stimulation test (LST), zonisamide was discontinued and daily oral prednisolone (40 mg, 0.8 mg/kg) was started.\nSerum creatinine levels decreased to 1.35 mg/dl and prednisolone dose was tapered monthly. However, 10 months later, serum creatinine levels increased again to 2.07 mg/dL (Fig. ). 67Ga scintigraphy revealed significant radioactive tracer uptake in both kidneys (Fig. C), suggestive of AIN recurrence. Oral prednisolone (40 mg/d) was restarted, and valproate and lacosamide were discontinued based on a neurologist's recommendation. Renal function immediately improved, although minor epilepsy occurrence increased. Oral prednisolone was gradually tapered to 10 mg/d, after which serum creatinine levels increased again to 1.99 mg/dL. Repeat renal biopsy revealed similar findings of tubulitis with both lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltrations. Prednisolone dose was increased to 60 mg (1.0 mg/kg) daily; nevertheless, it was difficult to discontinue carbamazepine due to the need for major epilepsy prevention. Since the patient had multiple AIN recurrence and was corticosteroid dependent, 1500 mg daily of oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was added to the corticosteroid therapy. This treatment was well tolerated and enable successful prednisolone dose tapering to 5 mg daily, with serum creatinine level stabilization (Fig. ).

{"clinical_note": "A 36-year-old male patient presented with anorexia, easy fatigability, and melena for 3\nmonths. His clinical examination was largely unremarkable. We found melena on a digital\nrectal examination. An upper GI endoscopy revealed a large mass projecting into the gastric\nlumen ( ), arising from the posterior gastric\nwall. The lesion was closer to the lesser gastric curvature than the greater curvature. At\nthe summit, the mass suffered from a bleeding mucosal ulcer, the cause of his melena.\nSeveral endoscopic biopsies were inconclusive, consisting of only gastric mucosal tissue\nwithin the biopsy specimens. An endoscopic ultrasound-guided needle aspiration revealed\nstromal cells on cytology. An abdominal CT demonstrated a well-defined, intramural mass\narising close to the lesser gastric curvature with a small mucosal defect at the\nsuperolateral aspect of the lesion ( ). The\nsoft-tissue fat planes were intact and there were no enlarged or abnormally enhancing lymph\nnodes. The patient's severe anemia was corrected with several preoperative transfusions.\nOperative steps : Under general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with\nhis legs split. Laparoscopic ports were inserted as shown in . The initial diagnostic laparoscopy did not reveal any peritoneal\ninvolvement. The lesser sac was accessed by dividing the gastrocolic and posterior gastric\nattachments. The tumor mass was large, making gastric retraction difficult. The tumor base\nat the posterior gastric wall exhibited increased vascularity ( ) without any evidence of invasion into adjacent tissues. After replacing\nthe stomach in its natural position, a liberal, longitudinal anterior gastrotomy was created\nat the summit of the tumor using ultrasonic shears. Manipulation of the tumor mass had\ncaused brisk bleeding from the ulcer, which could not be controlled with bipolar energy. The\ntumor was delivered through the gastrotomy ( ) and\npivoted over the shaft of a grasper placed parallel to the splenic axis. This caused the\ngastric wall adjacent to the tumor base to tent ( \n), allowing us to apply several linear staplers across it ( ). All sequential stapler fires were applied in close apposition to the tumor,\nwith the intention to save as much of the uninvolved posterior gastric wall. The use of\nstaplers not only allowed us to resect the lesion, which halted bleeding, but also\nsimultaneously reconstructed the posterior gastric wall. The staple line was oversewn on its\nluminal aspect with 2\u20130 polydiaxonone suture in a continuous manner after the resected\nlesion was placed in an endobag and parked adjacent to the right hepatic lobe. The anterior\ngastrotomy was closed using 2\u20130 delayed-absorbable barbed suture in two layers. The patient\nwas placed in a steep Trendelenburg position, and saline was instilled into the upper\nabdomen. Intraoperative gastroscopy with intraluminal CO2 insufflation helped objectively\nconfirm the integrity of the gastrotomy closures. The saline was suctioned out and a drain\nwas placed adjacent to the stomach through the flank port. The specimen was retrieved\nthrough a Pfannenstiel incision. The resected specimen measured 9.5 \u00d7 8.5 \u00d7 7.5 cm ( ).

Vascular examination revealed right femoral bruit and diminished right popliteal pulse, suggesting the presence of a right femoral lesion. However, the right ABI measured by a volume plethysmograph (Form PWV/ABI; Omron Health Care Co., Kyoto, Japan) was 1.28, within the normal range (1.00\u20131.40) (Fig. ). On the other hand, the left ABI was elevated to 1.55 (> 1.40), suggesting that the infrapopliteal arteries at the left ankle were incompressible. Upstroke time, the transit time from the nadir to the peak of the pulse volume waveform recording, of the right ankle was prolonged to 201 milliseconds (\u2265 180 milliseconds), whereas upstroke time of the left ankle was within the normal range (130 milliseconds) (Fig. ). These findings suggest that the right ABI was falsely normalized due to incompressible infrapopliteal arteries at the right ankle despite the presence of PAD in the right extremity. Indeed, intra-arterial angiography revealed the presence of a severe stenotic lesion at the origin of the right superficial femoral artery (SFA) (Fig. A), whereas there was no occlusive arterial disease in the left extremity. Fluoroscopic images showed severe calcification of infrapopliteal arteries at the right ankle (Fig. B).

The CT scan was interpreted by a radiology resident 15 minutes later and final interpretation by a board-certified emergency radiologist was completed in an additional 1 hour and 25 minutes. The initial CT interpretation indicated nonspecific wall thickening of the proximal jejunum, and occult small bowel injury could not be excluded. Given these findings, a repeat CT of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast was ordered by the trauma service as per our institution\u2019s standard protocol for evaluation of possible occult bowel injury in blunt abdominal trauma.\nThe follow up CT performed after midnight, 8 hours after the initial CT, demonstrated trace pneumoperitoneum, possibly originating from the splenic flexure of the colon without evidence of extravasation of oral contrast (Fig. ). The time from repeat CT scan completion to initial interpretation by a radiology resident was 30 minutes. The resident made the surgery team aware of these findings immediately. A board-certified emergency radiologist reviewed and provided another preliminary interpretation for the study 10 minutes later, confirming the presence of pneumoperitoneum. Based on the presence of pneumoperitoneum in a patient with blunt abdominal trauma, the patient was taken to the operating room as per standard protocol at our institution. Six hours after the follow up CT was performed, an academic board-certified abdominal radiologist provided a final interpretation.\nOn laparoscopy, cyst-like structures projecting from the wall of the distal transverse colon and splenic flexure were noted. Due to the patient\u2019s body habitus, the surgery team did not feel that they could adequately explore the area and the decision was made to convert to exploratory laparotomy. No evidence of bowel perforation was found. A segmental section of the diseased portion of the colon was taken and sent to pathology. Pathology results showed multiple enlarged cystic nodules ranging from 0.5 to 3 cm in the bowel wall (Fig. ).\nSubsequently, the radiologic studies were reviewed by a panel of abdominal radiologists. The panel concluded that the proximity of the pneumoperitoneum to the pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis suggested that the pneumoperitoneum may have been caused by incidental atraumatic or traumatic rupture of the cysts. However, they could not rule out bowel perforation based on imaging alone.\nThe patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was transferred to an acute care facility of equal acuity for further medical management as per the patient\u2019s health insurance request.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}

Corneal scrapings and confocal microscopy in vivo were performed instantly. A mass of hyphae was found in the 10% KOH wet mount stained with lactophenol blue and examined via confocal microscopy. Fungal keratitis was identified, and right corneal keratectomy was performed. Empirical antifungal and antibacterial therapy was initiated including topical and systemic fluconazole, levofloxacin, and cefminox sodium. After treatment of 2 weeks, the ulcer and symptoms did not improve and the patient was admitted to our hospital. Conjunctival congestion persisted, and a central corneal ulcer with a diameter of around 6 mm that reaches deep into the stromal layer can be seen (Fig. A, B). Subepithelial and superficial stromal opacities with dot-like and tentacle-like infiltrates accompanied this. Intracameral fluconazole injection was used to conduct a lamellar keratoplasty. Amphotericin B was administered immediately after the surgery. The first day post-surgery, hyperemia and a thin exudation membrane in the anterior chamber were discernible (Fig. C, D). Four days after the keratoplasty, full-thickness large central infiltrate with hypopyon was observed in the right eye (Fig. E, F). Given the increasing infiltrate with hypopyon and ineffectiveness of antifungal therapy, the right eye was enucleated. Microbial culture for corneal tissue revealed fungus-like organism showing long sparsely septate hyaline hyphae (Fig. G, H).

On examination, his abdomen was distended with generalized tenderness, but his laparoscopic wounds had healed.\nInitial laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 27,300/\u03bcL (4000\u201311,000 \u03bcL), hemoglobin 17.3 g/dL (10\u201315 g/dL), and serum lactate 7.6 mmol/L (0.5\u20131.9 mmol/L). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast revealed extensive acute on chronic portosplenic and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, with consequent small bowel ischemia (Fig. ).\nHe was admitted under the care of the acute surgical team and resuscitated, and underwent laparoscopic exploration, which confirmed the CT findings. After conversion to midline laparotomy, 255 cm of small bowel was resected (Fig. ) and the abdomen was left open with a vacuum-assisted closure device dressing (Fig. ). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. A second look was carried out 24 hours later, and both the small and large intestines appeared healthy, so primary anastomosis and abdominal closure were performed. A solid diet was introduced gradually, and the patient was discharged home on day 12 postoperation on warfarin. A thrombophilia screen was negative. The patient was seen multiple times for follow-up; he was tolerating oral intake and had reduced his BMI to 19 with no clinical manifestations of short bowel syndrome.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows individual\u2019s risk factors for development of condition', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 63-year-old woman visited a clinic for a palpable right axillary mass. US showed a 2.5-cm irregular hypoechoic mass in the right axilla, which was considered to be a malignant lymph node such as metastasis (Fig. ). Similar to physical examination and mammography, US revealed no remarkable findings in both the breasts and the left axillary region. A 14-gauge core-needle biopsy revealed the right axillary lymph node as a metastatic carcinoma, possibly from the breast, with positive estrogen receptor (ER) status. Breast MRI was performed to determine the presence of occult breast malignancy. No lesions were detected in the right breast, whereas a 0.6-cm irregular enhancing mass was observed in the left upper inner breast, assessed as breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) category 4C (Fig. A). To exclude primary malignancies other than breast cancer as the origin of the metastasis, chest computed tomography (CT) and whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) were performed. They revealed no specific findings, except the known right axillary metastasis.\nSecond-look US showed a 0.6-cm irregular, indistinct, isoechoic mass in the left upper inner breast, corresponding to the mass observed on breast MRI (Fig. B). US-guided 14-gauge core-needle biopsy confirmed the mass as an invasive carcinoma of no special type. The ER status of the cancer was positive, same as that of right axillary metastasis. Therefore, the right axillary metastasis was suspected to originate from the left breast cancer, and surgery was planned for its management and to confirm the diagnosis.\nRight axillary lymph node dissection and left breast conserving surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. The invasive carcinoma in the left breast was 6 mm in size, with cells positive for ER and progesterone receptor (PR) and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It was a low-grade invasive cancer with low Ki-67 expression (5%), histologic grade 1, and without lymphovascular invasion. Sentinel lymph node biopsy confirmed no left axillary involvement. In the right axilla, three macrometastatic lymph nodes were discovered, including the known palpable metastatic lymph node. Histologic findings of cancer cells in all three lymph nodes were fairly different from those of cancer cells in the left breast (Fig. ). Examination of the right axillary metastasis showed high-grade carcinoma with poorly formed glands and nests of atypical cells, while examination of the left breast mass showed low-grade cancer with well-differentiated glands and fairly uniform nuclei. These findings clearly indicated that the metastasis to the right axillary lymph node did not originate from the left breast cancer, although both of them showed ER positivity. Metastatic cancer cells in the right axilla were also positive for gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), suggesting that the metastasis was derived from the breast (Fig. ).\nFinally, the case was diagnosed as bilateral breast cancer consisting of occult right breast cancer with axillary metastasis (TxN1M0) and early-stage left breast cancer (T1bN0M0). Four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of taxane (AC-T) chemotherapy, radiation therapy for each breast, and hormone therapy were administered after surgery. No recurrence or metastasis was observed 14 months postoperatively.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 77-year-old Japanese woman, para 7, who went through menopause at age 48, suffered sudden onset of left lower abdominal pain and visited a primary care doctor. Computed tomography (CT) revealed torsion of a left ovarian cyst, and she was transferred to our hospital for surgery. She had a history of left-side breast cancer and underwent total left mastectomy at the age of 67, with no recurrence thereafter. Although she was a carrier of hepatitis C, her liver function and coagulation remained normal, and she was being followed-up without medication. Furthermore, she was taking nifedipine and candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. Meanwhile, her family history and psychosocial history were unremarkable. She also had no history of trauma.\nCT showed a 7.5-cm long elliptical mass in the left adnexal region that was continuous with the uterus (Fig. ). The ovary was atrophic because of the patient\u2019s age, and difficult to identify; the appearance of blood and the continuity with the surrounding pelvic peritoneum were suggestive of retroperitoneal hematoma. Physical findings at admission were as follows: height, 144.5 cm; weight, 57.2 kg; body mass index (BMI), 27.4 kg/m2; blood pressure, 112/50 mm Hg; pulse, 72 bpm; and body temperature, 37.1 \u00b0C. Physical examination detected no significant findings. On external (body surface) and internal examinations, no palpable masses or tenderness were noted in the left pelvic area. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed an atrophied uterus; however, the bilateral adnexa could not be identified due to atrophy. The hematoma in the left pelvis could be identified. These findings were identical to those obtained by CT. Blood test results were a hemoglobin value of 9.5 g/dL, a hematocrit value of 28.4%, a white blood cell count of 7970/\u03bcL, and a C-reactive protein level of 0.05 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed mild occult blood. After admission, the hematoma did not enlarge, and the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels did not decrease. After 11 days of bed rest, with no exacerbation of the inflammatory response, lower abdominal pain was relieved, and she was discharged. After discharge, we planned to investigate the cause of her bleeding on an outpatient basis, but 6 days after discharge, she was readmitted to our hospital after relapse of symptoms caused by retroperitoneal bleeding from the same site. The hematoma had grown to a size of 11.7 cm, and magnetic resonance imaging showed an abnormal vascular network extending from the left side of the uterus to the left adnexal area. Three-dimensional CT (3D-CT) similarly showed an abnormal vascular network on the left side of the uterus, and we suspected a possible arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or arteriovenous fistula (AVF) from the uterine artery to the left ovarian vein (LOV; Fig. ).\nWe decided that urgent treatment was needed for her repeated bleeding and performed vascular embolization therapy simultaneously with angiography. However, angiography of the internal iliac artery, including the left uterine artery, and the left external iliac artery, did not show AVM or AVF into the LOV. Angiography of the left renal artery confirmed that the contrast medium discharged from the left kidney did not flow into the inferior vena cava (IVC) but flowed back into the LOV (Fig. a). Subsequent venography also confirmed that the blood from the LRV did not flow into the IVC but regurgitated into the LOV and the lumbar vein (Fig. b). Left ovarian venography showed retrograde blood flow into a dilated and tortuous aneurysm in the pelvis and into the right internal iliac vein via a vein around the uterus (Fig. c). The cause of retroperitoneal bleeding was rupture of the LOV, the distension of which was caused by reflux. We performed embolization of LOV with N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and placed a coil centrally to prevent recanalization. Postembolization LRV imaging showed blood flow to the upper left lumbar vein and vertebral plexus (Fig. d). CT on the second day after the procedure confirmed good embolization of LOV and reduction of the retroperitoneal hematoma to a size of 6.4 cm (Fig. ). The patient then underwent regular outpatient follow-up, and the retroperitoneal hematoma gradually shrank and disappeared. At her final visit 2 years later, the hematoma had not recurred.\nIn this case, angiography confirmed the continuity of LRV and IVC but demonstrated no antegrade blood flow to the IVC. Therefore, we attributed LOV regurgitation to extravascular physical compression of LRV. After close examination of the CT images, we determined that LOV rupture was caused by NCS because the LRV was severely stenotic between the abdominal aorta and the SMA (Fig. ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

{"clinical_note": "A 70-year-old male, diagnosed with CTEPH, was hospitalized for PEA. He had post-exercise exhaustion and shortness of breath for almost 2 years, and experienced a sudden dizziness with visual rotation and syncope. Despite the medical therapy, the clinical symptoms gradually worsened. Echocardiogram showed a dilated and poorly functioning right ventricle, as well as a small left heart with normal systolic and diastolic function (Fig. -A1, A2)(Tricuspid annular plane systolic excusion (TAPSE) 9.6 mm, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 64%, average E/E\u203211.94, lateral E\u203212.1 cm/s,tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity 2.5 m/s). Ventilation/perfusion scan and computed tomography angiogram confirmed the presence of CTEPH at the sub-segmental levels.\nAfter the patient was induced, the initial pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was 93/46(63) mmHg, and preoperative right radial artery blood pressure (ABP) was 120/88 mmHg. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring presented the basic cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) range from 60 to 65%. After median sternotomy, the ascending aorta and both vena cava were cannulated regularly, and CPB was initiated. After the initiation of CPB, the mean PAP (mPAP) decreased to the range from17 to 31 mmHg. Aortic cross-clamping and blood cardioplegia were administered during pulmonary arteries dissociation. Then, the removal of thickened arterial intima and old organized thrombi was completed under deep hypothermic (22 \u00b0C) low flow (DHLF) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). NIRS fluctuates from 55 to 60% during DHLF and DHCA. After the surgical procedures, full flow was restored, heart rebeated, and the patient was gradually rewarmed to normal. Norepinephrine (0.05\u03bcg/kg.min), epinephrine (0.02\u03bcg/kg.min), and isoproterenol (0.02\u03bcg/kg.min) were used to maintain stable hemodynamics. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed good systolic and diastolic heart function.\nHowever, during the first attempt to discontinue CPB, the PAP increased rapidly to 63/35(43) mmHg, with unstable hemodynamic (ABP 70/40 mmHg), and TEE suggested right heart insufficiency, accompanied with normal left ventricular function. Then, CPB was resumed immediately. After assisting for another 45 min and increasing the dosage of vasoactive drugs (norepinephrine 0.06\u03bcg/kg.min, epinephrine 0.05\u03bcg/kg.min, isoproterenol 0.05\u03bcg/kg.min), the separation failed again, just the same as the first time. Considering that severe residual PH combined with right heart dysfunction are the main reasons for the failure of CPB weaning, ECMO was adopted. Consequently, 19F arterial cannula and 22F venous cannula were inserted into the right femoral vessels, and femoral VA-ECMO was initiated with a flow of 3.0 ~ 3.5 L/min. On arrival at the intensive care unit, ECMO flow rate was 3.5 L/min, and severe PH (PAP 56/25 mmHg) persisted with low ABP (70/55 mmHg). Echocardiography revealed significant decrease of biventricular function (Fig. B)(TAPES4mm, LVEF28%, average E/E\u203215, lateral E\u20326.7 cm/s, TR velocity 4.1 m/s) on postoperative day (POD) 1, indicating the patient developed severe secondary left ventricular dysfunction on the basis of right ventricular dysfunction, during ECMO support. The postoperative troponin-T(C-TNT) increased gradually (Fig. ), which suggested the myocardial injuries occurred. Hence, comprehensive measures were adapted: ECMO flow rate was reduced from 3.5 L/min to 2.5 L/min to decrease left ventricular afterload while maintaining systemic perfusion, norepinephrine (0.1\u03bcg/kg.min), epinephrine (0.06\u03bcg/kg.min) and isoproterenol (0.06\u03bcg/kg.min) were increased to ensure coronary perfusion, inhaled nitric oxide and treprostinil were administered to relieve PH. Besides, tidal volume was reduced to 6 ml/kg, and PEEP (5 cmH2O) was initiated to achieve lung protective ventilation. Oxygen flow rate was increased from 2 L/min to 6 L/min, with oxygen concentration raised to 47% for myocardial oxygen supply improvement. Moreover, atrial septostomy was carried out to decompress the right ventricle, so as to reduce the PAP. Consequently, mPAP decreased to 10 mmHg gradually, and the cardiac function improved slowly.\nOn POD 7, echocardiography revealed a normal sized heart with acceptable ventricular function (Fig. C). In this condition, ECMO was discontinued successfully, with satisfactory BP (90 ~ 120/50 ~ 80 mmHg), and normal PAP (mPAP 10-12 mmHg). The postoperative echocardiography data is shown in Table .\nThe postoperative course was complicated by unexpected brain ischemia and luminal infarction, which required tracheostomy on POD 13.

His parents reported that he had noisy and difficult breathing a few days after birth, which worsened over time and was associated with episodes of cyanosis and poor bottle feeding. A general pediatrician saw him at one month of age for stridor and poor weight gain, assumed a diagnosis of laryngomalacia, and advised the parents to increase the frequency of his feed. After that, his parents sought medical advice several times, including emergency department visits for significant respiratory distress, increasing stridor, and failure to thrive. He was then referred to our neurology clinic to assess hypotonia. No workup was performed, and he was not hospitalized before the referral. Physical examination revealed inspiratory stridor, suprasternal and subcostal retractions, tachypnea, and bilaterally reduced air entry.

No dysmorphic features were present.\nChest X-ray and regular laboratory test findings were normal, including serum electrolytes, complete blood counts, renal and liver functions, thyroid hormone levels, and blood gas analysis. The patient was taken to the operating room for an airway assessment based on the above findings. The patient underwent flexible laryngoscopy, which revealed a cystic mass measuring approximately 2 x 3 cm in size, arising from the lingual surface of the epiglottis and significantly occluding the laryngeal inlet (Figure ).\nDirect laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy under general anesthesia were promptly performed to evaluate the extent of the cystic lesion. The vocal cords, subglottic area, and trachea were observed to be normal. A thyroglossal cyst and retention cyst were initially considered as the differential diagnoses. However, based on clinical, endoscopic, and later histological findings, a vallecular cyst was established as the final diagnosis.\nMicrolaryngoscopic marsupialization was performed by the ENT surgeon to remove the cyst, which drained serous fluid. A biopsy of the cyst wall revealed the presence of connective tissue covered with non-keratinizing squamous epithelium with vascular congestion and chronic inflammation, suggestive of a vallecular cyst.\nPostoperatively, the patient was feeding well and showed a complete resolution of his symptoms.

Emergency personnel at the scene found him comatose and pulseless. After several rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and rapid sequence intubation, he was stabilized for transport to our hospital. On arrival to the emergency department, he had developed refractory hypotension and lost a carotid pulse for which he again required a round of CPR before return of spontaneous circulation. Once resuscitated and stabilized, head, spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scans were obtained. He was found to have bilateral temporal bone fractures as well as a transverse clival fracture, as well as diffuse but predominantly right-sided traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhages with scattered locules of pneumocephalus (Figure ). Spinal imaging revealed intradural air at the L3-L4 levels (Figure ). There was no imaging evidence of direct spinal trauma, nor any evidence of pneumothorax or pneumoperitoneum.\nNeurological examination on arrival revealed an intubated young male with a GCS of 6T: he did not open his eyes nor display any localizing movements but was able to withdraw all of his extremities from painful stimuli. He had dried blood in both ears but was otherwise without otorrhea or rhinorrhea.\nHe was admitted to our trauma ICU and an intracranial pressure monitor was placed and monitoring was noted as normal. A follow-up head CT was unchanged. His GCS improved rapidly and he was extubated 11 hours after admission, and his intracranial monitor was removed. Repeat neurological examination noted that he was coherent and oriented, but amnestic to his injury. He had developed a left facial nerve paresis and was prescribed a two-week course of prednisone without significant improvement noted by the time of discharge. He remained without strength or sensation deficits of his extremities. Pelvic injuries necessitated operative fixation on hospital day 2.

{"clinical_note": "A 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presented to the emergency with acute-onset, diffuse, cramping abdominal pain, worst in the epigastrium and lasting one day. He denied fever, vomiting, loss of appetite or weight loss, diarrhea, constipation, or rectal bleeding, or any prior similar episodes. He had no prior abdominal surgeries. On examination, he was in distress and had moderate guarding and generalized tenderness with hypoactive bowel sounds. He was afebrile. Laboratory evaluation showed microcytic anemia and thrombocytopenia on complete blood count, hypokalemia on basic metabolic profile, and a normal lipase level (Table ).\nAbdominal X-ray showed an evolving small bowel obstruction (Figure ), which was confirmed by a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast (Figure ). On the same CT scan series, a urachal remnant with a superimposed mass lesion was depicted (Figures , ).\nA decision was made to go forward with an emergent surgery to release the small bowel obstruction. After receiving a platelet transfusion, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy. He was found to have a high-grade small bowel obstruction due to an extensive mass concerning for a malignancy. A frozen section was intraoperatively sent and read as adenocarcinoma (Figure ).\nAn incisional biopsy of the urachal mass was also sent. The final pathology specimen was reported as a moderately differentiated urachal adenocarcinoma (Figure ) with positivity for CK20, CDX2, and CK7 (focal) stains (Figure ).\nThe patient was staged at Stage IIID (Sheldon staging) due to the spread to local viscera other than the bladder. The tumor was deemed unresectable due to the involvement of multiple loops of the small bowel and the mesentery of the small and large bowels. Systemic chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), folinic acid, and oxaliplatin (modified FOLFOX-6) was initiated. The patient has received six cycles of chemotherapy so far.

{"clinical_note": "The patient is a 28-year-old male with prior history of a grade 3 astrocytoma, who presented to our emergency department (ED) after having a general tonic-clonic seizure (GTC). Initially, his disease was appreciated four years prior when he presented with a GTC and was found to have a grade 3 astrocytoma of the left occipital lobe (Figure ). He underwent maximal safe resection followed by adjuvant EBRT to 45 Gy in 25 fractions at an outside institution. Due to reasons outside the patient\u2019s control, he received only two cycles of adjuvant temozolomide following EBRT. He developed disease recurrence, presenting as a GTC six months prior to this ED presentation, where imaging demonstrated tumor progression with increased extension into the parietal lobe (Figure ). He subsequently underwent a second maximal safe resection later that month. Final pathology returned as GB. Follow-up imaging four months afterward demonstrated disease progression and he was started on bevacizumab as well as a tumor treatment field (TTF) device. He unfortunately only tolerated TTFs for one month, ending one month prior to the ED presentation.\nUpon admission to our hospital from the ED, MRI demonstrated progression of disease in the left occipital-parietal lobes with extension into the splenium and anterior-inferior extension into the left thalamus and basal ganglia (Figure ). His physical exam was notable for mild right-hand weakness, but he was otherwise neurologically intact. Despite changes to his antiepileptic medication, he had seizure recurrence a few weeks following admission. Presuming that the area of tumor recurrence received a definitive dose in the past, the consensus decision was to proceed with repeat maximal safe resection with GammaTile placement. A dose of 60 Gy was prescribed to a 5 mm depth using a total of eight tiles, each containing four Cesium-131 3.5U seeds, to line the post-operative cavity volume of 17.6 cc. A significant portion of the occipital-parietal disease was debulked, with final pathology again demonstrating a grade 4 astrocytoma with molecular studies indicating an IDH-mutated, ATRX mutated, and MGMT promoter methylated phenotype with hypermutation. Postoperatively he was noted to have right upper and lower extremity weakness/spasticity with right foot drop and mild right face weakness. He required a cane to assist with ambulation and reported word-finding difficulties and decreased short-term memory. He was planning to start adjuvant temozolomide; however, he developed a severe GTC with increased muscle weakness and altered mental status two months later. MRI following this episode demonstrated mildly increased enhancement to the tissue surrounding the surgical bed with the progression of disease in the splenium and left thalamus/basal ganglia (Figure ).\nGiven this symptomatic disease progression, a treatment plan was made to take the progressive regions of disease outside the irradiated GammaTile volume to 35 Gy in 10 fractions. As shown in Figure , an initial planning target volume (PTV) was delineated consisting of the T1 post-contrast-enhancing disease with a 5 mm margin. The volume that received greater than 35 Gy from the GammaTile treatment was excluded from the PTV. The PTV was then separated into two portions by subdividing the remaining volume between tissue that received less than 17.5 Gy (PTV1), and that which received 17.5-35 Gy (PTV2). Using a volumetric modulated arc therapy plan with five arcs, one non-co-planar, a homogeneous dose of 35 Gy in 10 fractions was delivered to PTV1. This dose was calculated to have a biologically equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) of 45 Gy. Dose painting gradually decreased the dose from 35 Gy to as low a dose as achievable approaching the resection bed border of PTV2 (Figure ). A composite of the GammaTile dose volume (Figure ) with a dose delivered from PTV1 and PTV2 resulted in a homogeneous dose of approximately 50 Gy EQD2 to the residual disease extending into the splenium and the left thalamus/basal ganglia (Figure ). Digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM)-RT data from the initial 45 Gy delivered from the outside institution were obtained, and cumulative dose to critical organs at risk (OARs), including the brainstem, ocular structures, and cochlea, were within established constraints.\nDue to the hypermutation phenotype of his tumor, the patient was started on CCNU (100 mg/m2) and completed his EBRT with no issue or progression of his current neurological symptoms. He was last seen in follow-up by our team three months after his most recent EBRT, at which point he reported significant improvement in the right leg tremors/spasms and improved headache. He demonstrated decreased right foot drop but continued to have word-finding difficulties and short-term memory deficits. He has not developed any new areas of muscle weakness or paresthesia, visual loss, or other forms of altered sensoria. The current plan is to complete six cycles of CCNU with alternative systemic therapy thereafter upon disease progression. While temozolomide could be used to this effect, the high mutational burden found in his most recently resected disease would permit entry into currently available trials of immunotherapy.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}

The patient was intubated using a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope to avoid dislodging the foreign body. During fiberoptic intubation, a whitish plastic foreign body was found in the hypopharynx, which was removed using foreign body forceps under endoscopic guidance. Examination post foreign body removal showed a small wound in the posterior pharyngeal wall, which represents the site of the perforation (Figure ).

Shortly after ingestion, he called emergency medical services (EMS) for hives and difficulty breathing. He was tachypneic, diaphoretic, and nauseous on arrival to the ED, tripoding with a hot-potato voice, and had oropharyngeal angioedema. Vital signs showed a temperature of 98.5 (F), heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 cycles per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% while on 6 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.\nAfter receiving epinephrine x3, methylprednisolone 125mg x2, and diphenhydramine the patient was still symptomatic. Epinephrine infusion was commenced at 1 microgram/minute for refractory anaphylaxis. ENT observed uvula edema without laryngeal edema on two separate fiberoptic exams. Given voice changes in the ED, the patient was admitted to the ventilator unit for monitoring of biphasic anaphylactic reaction. He was titrated off the epinephrine drip for lack of hemodynamic instability congruent with anaphylaxis.\nInitial laboratory investigations showed a troponin of 0.03ng/ml at 4.5 hours post-ingestion which increased to 2.98 and 3.08 at 18 and 23 hours post-ingestion, respectively. The patient initially denied chest pain; however, when informed of his cardiac enzyme elevation, he retrospectively endorsed intermittent, non-radiating, mid-sternal chest pressure that was 5/10 in intensity after receiving epinephrine, which decreased to 2/10 in intensity within 24 hours. Electrocardiogram (EKG) at 22 hours post-ingestion showed sinus rhythm, left anterior fascicular block, and no ST-segment changes (Figure ).\nHe was started on aspirin, heparin infusion, and atorvastatin.\nAn echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function with an ejection fraction of 56-60%.

His social history was significant for 55 pack-years of smoking. Due to his mentation on arrival, no further history was obtained. Vital signs were normal on admission. Physical examination on admission showed non-responsiveness to sternal rub, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and thick white plaques around the corners of his mouth. Examination of the extremities showed 1+ bilateral lower leg edema, and pulmonary examination revealed right-sided wheezes and rales.\nOn admission, the patient had an elevated blood glucose of 662 mg/dL (normal: 70-110 mg/dL), an anion gap of 15, \u00df-hydroxybutyrate of 1.86 mmol/L (normal: 0.02-0.27 mmol/L), point-of-care (POC) lactate of 3.3 mmol/L (normal: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L), serum potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, urine volume of 850 mL, and no ketones on urinalysis. The arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.48, HCO3 of 24.6, and PCO2 of 33 meq/L. The slightly elevated anion gap on admission is likely multifactorial. It could have been caused by the increase in the negative charge for albumin and enhanced production of lactate seen in metabolic alkalosis []. Conversely, it is also possible that scant ketones, which are produced in a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, as seen by mildly elevated \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and the absence of ketones in the urine, could have contributed to the elevated anion gap [].\nAdditionally, the patient had hypernatremia (sodium of 185 mEq/L corrected for hyperglycemia), acute kidney injury (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] of 49 mg/dL, creatinine [Cr] of 1.55 mg/dL, from a previous baseline Cr of 1.01 mg/dL), and hemoconcentration (hemoglobin [Hb] 17.1 g/dL, hematocrit [Hct] 51.6%). Chest X-ray indicated a potential right lower lung zone infiltrate. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest indicated right lower lobe mass or consolidation, with multiple mediastinal and hilar masses as well as enlarged left axillary nodes compatible with lymphadenopathy, suggestive of malignancy and metastatic disease (Figures , ). CT of the abdomen showed heterogeneous liver attenuation but could not differentiate between nonocclusive disease and metastatic disease. Adrenal nodules and kidney nodular densities were also present (Figure ). CT of the brain showed a suprasellar mass measuring 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm (Figure ). The patient was started on half normal saline and insulin, and the acute kidney injury significantly improved on day 3; however, no significant improvement in sodium level was noticed after correction for elevated glucose levels (Figure and Table ).\nAdditional investigations for the refractory hypernatremia showed a urine osmolarity of 699 (normal: 50-1,400), serum osmolarity of 360 (normal: 280-301), urine sodium of 10 mEq/L (normal: 20 mEq/L), serum AM cortisol of 61.3 ug/dL (normal AM: 6.2-19.4 ug/dL), 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test cortisol of 6.06 ug/dL (normal: <1.8ug/dL) and ACTH of 228 pg/mL (normal: 7.2-63.3 pg/mL) (Table ). MRI of the brain revealed a 1.1 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm enhancing lesion of the optic chiasm without evidence of mass effect (Figure ) and small lymph nodes in deep portions of the bilateral parotid glands that were potential metastasis. Throughout the admission, the patient\u2019s arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a primary respiratory alkalosis with secondary metabolic alkalosis (pH of 7.48, HCO3 of 24.6, PCO2 of 33 meq/L), which was persistent until discharge (pH of 7.48, HCO3 of 27.6 meq/L, PCO2 of 37 mmHg). Additional endocrine investigations demonstrated an follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) of 0.3 miU/L (normal: 1.5-12.4 miU/L), luteinizing hormone (LH) < 0.3 miU/L (normal: 1.7-8.6 miU/L), testosterone of 27 ng/dL (normal: 264-916 ng/dL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 0.01 u/iU/L (normal: 0.34-5.60 u/iU/L), and prolactin of 9.7 ng/mL (normal: 4.0-15.2 ng/mL).

The patient's heart rate and blood pressure were noted to be within normal limits.\nPast medical history\nThe patient\u2019s past medical history includes hypertension being treated with lisinopril, and diabetes mellitus being managed with metformin. Patient encounter records confirm that at some time between two and three months prior to presentation, the patient began taking levofloxacin daily. An occurence of painful rectal bleeding in 2015 prompted a colonoscopy, which revealed a colonic polyp and grade two hemorrhoids.

Radiologic interpretation suggested these findings could be indicative of acute or chronic inflammation that may be an unusual presentation of chronic appendicitis. A dilated right extrarenal pelvis and proximal ureter with minimal right calyceal dilation were also seen (Figures , ). In addition, a small non-obstructing stone in the right renal pelvis was seen, suggesting a chronic ureteropelvic junction stricture.

A follow-up colonoscopy revealed the absence of the haustra between the transverse colon and rectum, without any obvious tumors. Histopathological examination of multiple random biopsy specimens obtained from the transverse colon to the rectum showed dysplasia with p53 overexpression in the rectum, which suggested cancer.\nWe performed laparoscopic proctocolectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy concomitantly with TaTME. The procedure involved two surgical teams. We inserted five abdominal ports, and the colon was mobilized from the ileocecal region to the rectum along with laparoscopy-guided dissection of blood vessels. The rectum was mobilized in the TME plane, and the left and right neurovascular bundles were incised. Transanal surgery was performed simultaneously using the laparoscopic procedure. We used the Lone Star Retractor System (Cooper Surgical, Trumbull, CT, USA), GelPOINT path transanal access platform (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA), and AirSeal system (ConMed, Utica, NY, USA) to ensure active smoke evacuation to aid in the visualization of the operative field. Circumferential mucosectomy was performed with preservation of the anal sphincter muscle. We used a purse-string suture and closed the rectal lumen to prevent mucus leakage and cancer cell dissemination. Mucosectomy was performed starting from the dentate line and extending into the anal canal. The circular and longitudinal muscles were incised, and the abdominal cavity was opened (Figure ). The specimen was extracted after a slight extension of the umbilical port site. We created an ileal pouch (J-pouch) and performed an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.

After radiation was completed, she was started on nivolumab 240 mg IV every two weeks in August 2019. In January 2020, her nivolumab was held due to worsening transaminitis and thyroiditis, which presented as hypothyroidism and then hyperthyroidism after starting levothyroxine. CT abdomen was done at that time, which showed increased heterogeneous attenuation of the liver. She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily. With her history of being a current smoker of 1 ppd for the last 30 years, she admitted to a productive cough that was clear in nature, chest tightness, and orthopnea but denied paroxysmal dyspnea and fever. Chest CT without contrast, done in February 2020, as seen in Figure , showed multiple pulmonary nodules with some interstitial/ground-glass changes in the upper lobes bilaterally, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe, which were worse than her previous chest CT two weeks prior, as seen in Figure . She was diagnosed with nivolumab-induced pneumonitis. Her lab work showed a very low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of < 0.07 along with her free triiodothyronine (T3) being normal, free thyroxine (T4) of 4.6, and negative thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO) antibody. Levothyroxine was then stopped. She still had transaminitis. She was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible pneumonia. A higher intravenous dose of steroids was initiated. She underwent bronchoscopy with BAL with findings of erythematous bronchial mucosa of the right lower lobe. BAL results were negative, including a viral panel, Gram stain and culture, and fungal stain and culture. After increasing the steroids, she felt better, and her breathing improved. She was discharged on prednisone 60 mg daily and was recommended to follow up on an outpatient basis with oncology and pulmonology.

The pathology report showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with visceral pleural invasion and transcription termination factor 1 positive. She completed carboplatin/Alimta in 2018. In January 2019, her repeat chest CT (Figure ) showed multiple nodular masses in the right lower lobe where her original lung cancer was. A positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan was done, which showed subpleural nodules with moderate fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) activity, indicating relapse. At that time, she had declined a biopsy. She was started on palliative chemotherapy of carboplatin, taxol, and pembrolizumab in March 2019 and finished the regimen in May 2019.

{"clinical_note": "A 71-year-old lady initially presented with gradual onset of painless lower limb weakness for one week \u201coff legs\u201d, lower limb paresthesias and increased urinary frequency. Patient denied any recent symptoms of infective etiology. There was no recent or past history of trauma or accidents. Patient\u2019s past medical history was unremarkable and also had no family history of significant concern. Patient was a non-smoker and teetotaler and there was no exposure to environmental factors such as industrial chemicals, radiation, heavy metals or any toxin exposures reported. Patient led an active life as a housewife (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status 1 before admission) and used to live with her partner. On examination she had symmetrical lower limb motor weakness in an upper motor neuron pattern with Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle power 4/5 both proximally and distally on admission. There were reduced sensations in lower limbs symmetrically to fine touch, pinprick, temperature and proprioception, initially mild but progressed to significant sensory loss over next couple of weeks with sensory level slightly below umbilicus at T11. There was relative sparing of saddle area and anal tone was patulous. There was no spinal tenderness. Her deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs were exaggerated with extensor plantar responses. Rest of the general and systemic examination was unremarkable. Her blood tests including full blood count, inflammatory markers, B12, folate, thyroid functions, calcium, liver function test and myeloma screen came back normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis done on second day after admission was unyielding and non-specific with normal protein, glucose and cytology etc. She was evaluated with non-contrast MRI spine which showed focal myelopathic cord signal at the conus and at the level of T10 and T11 vertebrae (radiological differential diagnosis on MRI were B12 deficiency/inflammatory/infection) (Figure ).\nWhile being evaluated for same, she underwent a chest x-ray which was suggestive of suspicious nodules in the right lower and mid zone. This triggered further computed tomography (CT) scans with contrast which showed disseminated malignancy with metastatic lesions to anterior chest wall, liver, lungs, and a necrotic 3.5 cm nodal mass in the left gastric region. There was no obvious primary identified on the CT scan. Tumor markers cancer antigen (CA)-125, CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 15-3 were all negative. A repeat MRI spine with contrast was done afterward with suspicion of spinal metastasis which has led to lower limb weakness. MRI contrast showed a 20*10*19 mm enhancing soft tissue metastatic mass lesion seen within conus in comparison with plain MRI done one week earlier (Figure ).\nThere was no obvious primary identified on the CT. This was discussed in upper GI MDT (Gastrointestinal multidisciplinary team) and was thought to be a disseminated malignancy arising from a gastric primary. An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed a deep, malignant-looking gastric ulcer on the high anterior greater curve of stomach. This was seen with EUS as a hypoechoic mass extending into the serosal margin. Biopsy from the stomach lesion surprisingly showed a metastatic malignant melanoma. Histopathology showed scanty strips of benign columnar epithelium with most of the tissue representing tumour, focally necrotic (Figure ). Immunohistochemical assays for focal Melan-A, human melanoma black-45 and SOX10 confirmed the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the BRAF gene was done which revealed the presence of a mutation within codon 600.\nThis case was discussed again in dermatology-oncology MDT after biopsy results and was decided that the best course of action would be palliative treatment, considering the advanced stage of the disease and poor performance status. Management options and prognosis were discussed with patient who agreed to palliative management. After discharge patient contracted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia for which she was again hospitalized and treated with oral dexamethasone 6mg (milligrams) once a day and oxygen inhalation via nasal cannula between 2-4lit/min for 10 days.

{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 79-year-old Caucasian male with a 7-year history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a complaint of abdominal pain. The pain started in the evening of the day before and was accompanied by fever, oral intolerance, nausea, and vomiting. He did not complain of bowel habit changes, although he had a history of chronic constipation. Past medical and surgical history was positive for MDS and cholecystectomy. MDS was controlled with daily thalidomide, deferasirox, dimethicone, pantoprazole, gabapentin, vitamin B12, and folic acid. He also took erythropoietin and rivaroxaban three times a week and filgrastim every fifth day. The family history and habitual history of the patient were unremarkable.\nThe patient was awake and oriented on admission, yet he was ill, dehydrated, and mildly agitated. He had blood pressure 95/60 mmHg, pulse rate 105/min, respiratory rate 17/min, Temperature 37.9 \u00b0C, and O2 Saturation 90% on ambient air. Tenderness of the epigastrium and right upper quadrant of the abdomen was noted, without abdominal distension, rebound tenderness, or guarding. Laboratory results were as mentioned in Table . The patient\u2019s electrocardiogram was unremarkable.\nPlain thoracic and abdominopelvic radiographs were normal. In abdominopelvic ultrasonography, mild fluid in subhepatic and inflamed echogenic fat in the upper abdomen and around the pancreas was found, along with duodenal wall thickening. With the impression of pancreatitis, intravenous Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole, Ondansetron, normal saline, and one unit of packed red blood cells were administered. As the patient did not have a proper urinary output (200ml since urinary catheterization), the computed tomography (CT) scan was performed without intravenous contrast. The abdominopelvic CT scan demonstrated edematous wall thickening of the entire duodenum with water halo and significant adjacent fat stranding and swelling of the pancreas. Pancreatitis was a potential etiology of secondary duodenal wall thickening []. However, observing the bulk of the pathologic changes at the duodenum and severe duodenal wall edema also raised the possibility of primary duodenal pathology. Accordingly, a sign of ischemia was suggested, and a contrast-enhanced CT scan was advised to evaluate the related vessels further.\nThe patient remained hypotensive and oliguric regardless of intravenous fluid resuscitation. Nine hours after admission, norepinephrine was initiated. However, blood pressure remained low and fluctuated during the next five hours, with the minimum being 60/40 mmHg. Despite supportive treatment, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated to the extent of severe electrolyte imbalance, gasping, severe acidosis (arterial pH = 6.8), and GCS 4/15. Due to the mentioned deterioration, another abdominopelvic CT scan with intravenous contrast was requested at the fourteenth hour of admission. The second CT scan demonstrated a marked decrease in the enhancement of the edematous duodenum and target sign. Since the related visible vessels were patent, microvascular ischemia or necrosis of the duodenum was highly suggested (Fig. ).\nThe patient was immediately transferred to the operating room in a critical condition. With a midline laparotomy incision, 400 mL serous fluid was drained. Kocher\u2019s maneuver was performed to explore the duodenum and the retroperitoneal structures. Duodenum (D2\u2013D3\u2013D4) was grossly ischemic, the stomach was dilated, and the small bowel distal to the Treitz ligament appeared normal (Fig. ). The Pancreas was normal in view, without any saponification, inflammation, or edema in favor of pancreatitis. Exploration of the superior mesenteric artery and vein did not reveal any pathologic findings. Whipple\u2019s procedure was planned initially. However, the patient\u2019s cardiac arrest during the operation directed the plan to a damage control surgery. The overall operation time was approximately one hour and a half. To do the pyloric exclusion in the shortest time, the pylorus was isolated, and a polyester surgical tape was passed behind that. Tight ligation of the tape around the pylorus temporarily excluded the ischemic duodenum. To achieve a damage control surgery, decompression of the stomach was done by a red (18 French) nasogastric tube (Fig. ). Lastly, an open (corrugated sheet) drain was placed near the duodenum, and the patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit. Despite two hours of supportive therapy, blood pressure remained 40 mmHg/pulse, leading to a cardiac arrest with asystole rhythm and patient expiration.

{"clinical_note": "In 2017, an 83-year-old Japanese woman presented to our department with a chief complaint of a mass in her right maxillary premolar region. She had initially noticed a painless mass in her right maxillary premolar region in 2002. After she had first noticed of the mass, it grew gradually in size, but she sought no treatment for it. She was referred to us for examination and treatment because it was difficult to perform tracheal intubation for surgery of sigmoid colon cancer at another hospital. Her history included sigmoid colon cancer, subarachnoid hemorrhaging, bronchitic asthma, and cardiac insufficiency. Regarding the intra- and extra-oral findings, a massive pedunculated mass in the right maxillary premolar region measuring 83 \u00d7 58 \u00d7 35 mm was palpable (Fig. ). Furthermore, it covered the front of the right palate, and it protruded to the extra-oral region from the right maxillary premolar alveolar region. Its surface was almost entirely smooth, and some erosions and ulcerations were seen. It was elastic and hard and showed no tenderness on palpation. There was no palpable regional lymphadenopathy, and a laboratory examination revealed no abnormal values.\nPanoramic X-ray revealed the shadow of the mass in the right maxillary premolar region, which included some hard tissue (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) showed scattering calcified images in the mass (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging was not performed because she had vertebral artery clips and screws in her forehead. Given the above findings, we suspected benign gingival tumor in the right maxillary premolar region and performed a biopsy under local anesthesia (Fig. a, b).\nHistologically, proliferation of dysplastic squamous epithelia was observed (Fig. ). We noted subepithelial mild dysplastic spindle-shaped cells and collagenous fibers, and scattered calcification and ossification were also observed (Fig. ). Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were negative for pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), and nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin was not observed in the spindle cells (data not shown). Therefore, we excluded a diagnosis of carcinosarcoma and fibromatosis. However, we were unable to diagnose absolutely whether the dysplastic squamous epithelia were pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia of the gingiva or well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed that the maximum standard unit value (SUVmax) of the sigmoid colon and the oral lesion were 15.27 and 14.99, respectively, and there were no other obvious metastases (Fig. ). Therefore, we performed tumorectomy under general anesthesia. The pedicle of the tumor was located at the right maxillary premolar area, and the tumor\u2014including the tissue surrounding the lesion\u2014was resected as one mass together with the periosteum (Fig. a\u2013d). At that time, partial destruction of the maxillary bone was seen. The exposed bone surface was slightly curetted. After resection, the wounded area was covered with artificial dermis (TERDERMIS). Finally, tie-over dressing by gauze with ointment was performed.\nThe microscopic findings of the surgically removed tumor were similar to those of the biopsy specimen. The body of the tumor was composed of spindle-shaped cells that were proliferating with collagenous fiber, and scattered bone formation was also observed (Fig. ). The destruction of the basement membrane by atypical squamous epithelia was observed in the surgically removed specimen, suggesting stromal invasion. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the dysplastic squamous epithelia were positive for Ki67 and CK17, suggesting that they were squamous cell carcinoma, not pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia. Furthermore, some spindle cells were positive for smooth muscle action (SMA), indicating myofibroblastic differentiation. Therefore, the epithelial component of the tumor was considered to be well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Because most of the tumor was occupied by spindle-shaped cells and marked ossification histopathologically, we diagnosed the tumor as POF with squamous cell carcinoma (pT1N0M0).\nOne week after surgery, we removed the gauze and covered the wound with an oral appliance for protection (Fig. a, b).

{"clinical_note": "A 57-year-old Caucasian woman was recently diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian cancer. Otherwise healthy, she had initially consulted her general practitioner simply for abdominal distension. Further investigations [abdominal computed tomography (CT), serum CA125determination and laparoscopy] revealed a peritoneal carcinomatosis. The diagnosis of stage III (FIGO classification) ovarian cancer was established and the patient received a carboplatin-paclitaxel based chemotherapy regimen in a neoadjuvant setting. The indication of a debulking surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) was retained by our institutional tumor board. A CVL was inserted via the right jugular vein into the superior vena cava in prevision of surgery and the appropriate positioning of the catheter was verified by chest x-ray. An implantable central venous catheter (Port-a-Cath) was already in place (Fig. ).\nThe first 48 postoperative hours were marked by difficult pain management, hypotension, and transient hyperlactatemia responding to fluid replacement and norepinephrine. On postoperative day 3, she presented acute onset dyspnea when transferred from the bed to a chair, and a major drop in pulse oxygen saturation (from SpO2 96% to 83%) justified the administration of oxygen (5 L/min) via a nasal cannula. On physical examination, her body temperature was 37.4 \u00b0C, blood pressure 135/81 mmHg, heart rate 122 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min. No chest pain was reported. Pulmonary examination revealed a bilateral reduction of basal breath sounds with dullness at percussion. Chest x-ray examination (Fig. ) showed bilateral pleural effusions that could largely explain patient\u2019s dyspnea and oxygen desaturation. After switching from a nasal cannula to a nonrebreather mask (FiO2 0.40), the patient\u2019s condition seemed to stabilize in supine position. A measurement of the arteriovenous oxygen difference was obtained via sampling through the arterial and central venous line after the patient was again lying in supine position (Table ).\nA sampling error or a wrong positioning of the recent CVL was suspected, but a sample taken from the Port-a-Cath confirmed the venous value. A transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with bubble test failed to show a right-to-left shunt, atrial septum was intact. No pulmonary hypertension was detected and right ventricle was not dilated. A CT pulmonary angiography (Fig. ) showed large bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis of both lower lobes, acute pulmonary embolism in the right middle and upper lobe pulmonary arteries, and ultimately an anatomical variant of the left upper pulmonary vein draining into the left innominate vein. Following bilateral chest drainage, the patient was treated with low molecular weight heparin twice daily. There was no evidence for deep venous thrombosis. This was followed by a significant clinical improvement, a disappearance of the platypnea\u2013orthodeoxia complaints and a reduction of oxygen requirement over the following days.\nAt 1-year follow-up, TTE showed no right ventricular dilation and absence of pulmonary hypertension.

He was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma in 2010 and treated with an R-CHOP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) for six cycles, achieving complete response; in 2017, because of a disease recurrence, he was treated with six chemotherapy cycles with R-bendamustine, followed by maintenance therapy only with rituximab for 2 years. The last administration was in February 2020. Clinical and radiological follow-up was negative; during the maintenance therapy, the patient had urinary tract recurring infections, gingivitis, and herpes zoster cutaneous reactivation.\nHe sought medical attention because of progressive vision loss. His pharmacological therapy included atorvastatin, amlodipine, and pantoprazole. He was afebrile; his vital signs were in range. General and neurological physical examination was negative, except for right homonymous hemianopia. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed an uneven cortical and subcortical hypodense lesion in the left posterior temporal and occipital areas, with no contrast enhancement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the left parenchymal lesion, composed of two parts: a periventricular one showing inhomogeneous signal (decrease in T1-weighted, increase in T2-weighted sequences); and a more uniform one, involving white matter and characterized by strong T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity. Restricted diffusion was noted in both components, especially in the white matter, but no gadolinium enhancement was observed. Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy pointed out a reduction of N-acetyl aspartate peak, an elevated choline peak, and a double peak of lactic acid.\nTotal body contrast CT did not document hematological disease activity and confirmed the two previously known lymph nodes, a left axillary and a right mediastinal para-esophageal one, stable in dimensions (16 \u00d7 10 and 11 \u00d7 6 mm, respectively). Neurological findings were interpreted as a consequence of intracranial relapsed lymphoma. So, after a multidisciplinary assessment, brain biopsy was planned. Histological samples showed a large number of macrophages (CD68+, CD14+) overshadowing any other cell, except for isolated reactive astrocytes and mild perivascular T-lymphocyte infiltrates. No neoplastic cell was clearly individuated. No microbiological test was performed on brain tissue.\nThe patient, discharged after brain biopsy, returned to the hospital because of worsening eyesight, mental confusion, and psychomotor slowing. Laboratory investigation on blood was not significant: peripheral blood cell count was normal with 4.61 \u00d7 109 white blood cells and mild reduction in hemoglobin level (13.9 g/dL); C-reactive protein was < 5 mg/L. Electrolyte levels, renal function, liver enzyme levels, and coagulation examinations were in range.\nBrain MR was repeated (Figs. , ) and showed, especially on FLAIR/T2-weighted images, the hyperintense left temporal\u2013parietal\u2013occipital and peritrigonal lesion notably increased in dimension and extended from the left to the right hemisphere through the corpus callous. It was also characterized by vasogenic edema with a slight mass effect on cortex gyri. There was no significant contrast enhancement; diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed restricted diffusion around lesion edges. Despite the rapid progression of clinical and imaging findings, the absence of significant contrast enhancement and, above all, the inconclusive response of previous histological report excluded the hypothesis of an expanding neoplastic lesion; MR features were instead considered suggestive for inflammatory demyelinating process, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was finally suspected. Therefore, a diagnostic lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid appeared clear and colorless. Chemical\u2013physical analysis showed presence of 10 leukocytes/\u03bcL (0.00\u20135.00) and mild elevation in protein level (albumin 0.350 g/L); glucose level was normal (cerebrospinal-fluid-to-serum ratio 82%). There was an immunoglobulin G (IgG) level of 0.025 g/L and an IgG index (Link index) of 0.66 (< 0.7). Oligoclonal bands were negative. Bacterioscopic and microscopic examination for Cryptococcus neoformans was negative; cultural examinations for mycobacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Toxoplasma were negative; galactomannan antigen was absent; polymerase chain reaction for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex 1 and 2, HHV6, HHV7, HHV8, varicella\u2013zoster, measles, BK virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, Toscana virus, and rubella was negative; virus JC quantitative real-time PCR was positive with detection of numerous viral genomes (9,548,473 units/\u03bcL).\nCSF serology for aforementioned infectious agents was negative. CFS immunophenotype, despite the low amount of cells after centrifugation, was characterized by 18.0% of lymphocyte, predominantly T, without any B population.\nBlood serology for HIV Ag/Ab was negative.

{"clinical_note": "In December 2017, a 19-year-old female was referred to our hospital with a recent diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma. The patient had presented as pharyngeal pain and left neck mass with fever for 2 months. She had received tracheotomy because of airway obstruction resulting from the large mass arising from the left parapharyngeal space at local clinic. PET/CT scan showed a large solid mass located in the left parapharyngeal space with compression of pharyngeal cavity and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left neck (). The histopathological review confirmed diagnosis of HS. Histologically, HS is composed of large polygonal cells with epithelioid-to-pleomorphic morphology, abundant eosinophilic to vacuolated or foamy cytoplasm, ovoid to irregularly shaped nuclei, and variably prominent nucleoli (). For immunohistochemical markers, most HS express CD68 and CD163 and partially express S100 (). Chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and etoposide (CHOEP)) was initially started on December 8, 2017 with the aim of stabilization of the fulminate disease course; however, the lesions did not shrink and pain and dysphagia were heavier caused by the compression of the pharynx (). In order to relieve the compression, irradiation to the lesions of pharyngeal and neck was started on day 11 of chemotherapy. After irradiation of 20 Gy/10 F, the size of lesions became a little bit smaller (pharyngeal mass: from 6.0 cm \u00d7 4.4 cm to 5.6 cm \u00d7 4.0 cm; neck mass: from 3.5 cm \u00d7 2.8 cm to 2.9 cm \u00d7 2.6 cm).\nMeantime, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissue was performed using a panel of 93 genes (Gene+ OncoLym). This analysis revealed the presence of oncogenic mutation c.2888-1G>T in the MET gene, exon 14 (allele frequency, 5.58%), as well as an activated mutation c.361T>A (C121S) in the MAP2K1 gene, exon 3 (allele frequency, 17.23%). MEK inhibitor trametinib has been reported to be effective in HS patients with MAP2K1 mutation (); however, trametinib was not available in China at that time. It has been reported that patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutation-positive nonsmall cell lung cancer are sensitive to MET inhibitor crizotinib (); therefore, this histiocytic sarcoma patient began to take crizotinib (250 mg, twice daily) after irradiation of 20 Gy/10 F. Partial response (PR) was observed after radiotherapy of a total dose of 60 Gy/30 F and 1-month treatment of crizotinib, with sum of the product of the longest perpendicular dimensions (SPD) decreased by 57% (). The lesions kept shrinking () after radiotherapy, and crizotinib was still taken daily for 1 month more. However, 2-month treatment of crizotinib cost her family RMB 100,000 Yuan. The patient could no longer afford such an expensive drug.\nIn order to search for new targetable therapeutic drugs, NGS was done again with a panel of 1,021 genes (Gene+ Onco-C1021T). The most frequently mutated genes were mutation c.410G>A (G137D) in the DUSP2 gene, exon 2 (allele frequency, 18.9%), mutation c.290G>A (C97Y) in the HIST1H3B gene, exon 1 (allele frequency, 15.9%), and mutation c.3646A>T (S1216C) in the GRIN2A gene, exon 13 (allele frequency, 15.7%). Both DUSP2 and GRIN2A are in the RET signaling pathway. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that inhibits RET, PDGFR, and KIT. It has been reported to be effective in some HS cases (). The patient was subsequently treated with imatinib (400 mg daily) and thalidomide (100 mg daily) since March 2018. The cost of imatinib and thalidomide was RMB 2,600 Yuan/month. Two months after the treatment, excellent PR was observed () compared with tumor size in March 2018. Four months later the re-evaluation by CT scans showed a nearly complete remission (CR) (). The patient took maintenance of imatinib and thalidomide for 2 years and stopped the treatment in March 2020. To date (September 2021), 45 months after HS diagnosis, she is still alive without tumor recurrence.\nTo explore the possible underlying mechanism of imatinib plus thalidomide in this HS patient, experiments in vitro were performed in a canine HS cell line DH82. Results of cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assays showed that the proliferation activity of DH82 was significantly inhibited by imatinib but not thalidomide (). Combined thalidomide and imatinib treatment did not improve the inhibitory effects of imatinib to DH82 (). We speculated that no synergistic effect existed between imatinib and thalidomide, but each of them might have its own specific antitumor activity.\nAs mentioned above, mutations of DUSP2 and GRIN2A are involved in the RET signaling pathway. RET signaling leads to the activation of the RAS/MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathways and has key roles in cell growth, differentiation, and survival (). Further KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of NGS results from patient\u2019s tissue also revealed that PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways were activated in this HS patient (). Immunohistochemistry staining on the patient\u2019s tissue was performed to detect phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) and phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK) of MAPK pathway and phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) of PI3K/AKT pathway. Results showed that p-AKT and p-ERK were strongly positive, while p-JNK was almost negative (), indicating the patient actually harbored the activation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Treatment of DH82 with imatinib demonstrated that p-ERK and p-AKT were substantially inhibited with imatinib while p-JNK was slightly elevated in a dose-dependent manner, which confirmed the inhibitory effects of imatinib on DH82 by targeting activation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways ().", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

{"clinical_note": "We hereby report the case of a 16-year-old Caucasian female who has been followed at our Allergy Unit of Meyer Children's University Hospital in Florence for allergic asthma since the age of 6. At the physical examination, she presented a history of respiratory clinical manifestations such as cough and shortness of breath. During her asthma history, she also reported two hospitalizations: the first one during a wheezing episode triggered by an airway infection and the second one during an asthmatic attack without an infection. She required treatment with short-acting \u03b22-agonist and systemic corticosteroids during her asthma exacerbations. The patient presented positive skin prick tests to house dust mites and cat fur from the first clinical evaluation and a positive skin prick test to pollen (grass, mugwort, hazel, birch, and poplar) during the follow-up.\nShe also suffered from food allergy, i.e., to nuts, with sensitization to lipid transfer protein and profilin. At the age of 2, the patient had anaphylaxis after eating cashew and adrenaline autoinjectors were prescribed. She had skin prick tests, prick by prick tests, and blood tests for nuts, and they resulted positive not only for cashew but also for peanut, almond, hazelnut, walnut, pine nut, and pistachio, which were all excluded from the diet. Moreover, with carrots and fennels, she presented itch in her throat and dyspnea. For this reason, following the positive skin prick tests, the patient also excluded these foods from the diet. At 16 years old, the patient presented anaphylaxis twice after eating a pear and shrimps, which were then excluded from her diet.\nApart from asthma and food allergy, she did not suffer from other illnesses. The patient reported a parental history of atopic disease: her mother suffered from nickel contact allergy and her father from rhinoconjunctivitis with grass and Parietaria pollen sensitization.\nWe have evaluated all the possible differential diagnoses with asthma or additional factors, which were eventually ruled out. For example, no clinical features of chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, or gastroesophageal reflux were detected. The patient also underwent an electrocardiogram, which did not reveal any rhythm abnormalities.\nAfter the diagnosis of asthma, she attended periodic follow-up visits at our Allergy Unit, where spirometry was performed each time as well. Afterwards, at 16 years old, her asthma clinical manifestations worsened progressively, becoming severe despite treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting \u03b22-agonist, and anti-leukotriene (fluticasone/salmeterol and montelukast) (). Indeed, she had frequent asthma exacerbations, especially in the evenings, about once every month, and dyspnea for minimal physical efforts while under these treatments. In addition, the patient presented a spirometry with a reversible lung obstruction. Indeed, the patient presented a basal FEV1 of 79% with a positive bronchodilatation test equal to 290 ml (+12%).\nThus, treatment with subcutaneous injections of the anti-IgE antibody omalizumab, 600 mg every 2 weeks, was started at the age of 16 years, although it was used as off-label due to her high total IgE serum concentration (2,003 kU/L). The patient's clinical condition benefitted from the treatment with omalizumab (, ), with clinical improvements after the first injection and with an improvement of the spirometry (FEV1 = 94%, with a negative bronchodilatation test) performed after the seventh injection.\nDuring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the patient did not change her habits, including going to school, and on October 20, 2020, one of her classmates resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 from real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab. Therefore, she was sent home for quarantine. Indeed, she did not suffer from clinical manifestations typical of COVID-19, nor her asthmatic signs or symptoms did worsen at the time. However, after 7 days, she performed RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab, which resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was still without clinical manifestations at the time, but after 2 days she developed diarrhea, asthenia, myalgia, epistaxis, and maximum body temperature 37.5\u00b0C treated successfully with paracetamol. At that time, the patient had been undergoing therapy with subcutaneous omalizumab every 2 weeks for about 3 months, as well as fluticasone/salmeterol and montelukast daily (). Moreover, during quarantine, omalizumab treatment was easily continued at home, and it was switched to self-administration through telephonic support and digital material available online (), such as educational videos and the Asthma Control Test. It is worth mentioning that the patient remained free of asthma clinical manifestations the whole time she was positive of SARS-CoV-2, without significant differences in asthma management during this period (). Furthermore, no drug adverse events have been recorded.

{"clinical_note": "Our case concerns a 48-year-old male with a history of syphilis and heterozygous AS sickle cell trait. Mantle cell lymphoma with multiple lymphomatous polyposis had been diagnosed based on a bone marrow biopsy. The patient received three cycles of R-Maxi CHOP and three cycles of R-High Dose-Ara-C (Nordic protocol\n) with complete response on the CT scan. His peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were mobilized and harvested on his last cycle of R-High Dose Ara-C with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor. Seven months after his diagnosis and two months after his last chemoimmunotherapy, he underwent the BeEAM protocol for an autologous HCT, which consists of bendamustine 200 mg/m2 intravenously given on days \u20138 and \u20137, cytarabine 200 mg/m2 intravenously twice a day on days \u20136 to \u20133, etoposide 100 mg/m2 intravenously twice a day on days \u20136 to \u20133, and melphalan 140 mg/m2 intravenously on day \u20132.\n He was only taking vitamin D supplements at the time.\nBaseline laboratory workup was unremarkable, as shown in . On day \u20138, he began the BeEAM protocol and received his first dose of intravenous bendamustine 440 mg (200 mg/m2). He also received intravenous fluids as part of the BeEAM protocol. From day \u20136, his urine output, serum sodium and serum creatinine started to increase (). His urine output markedly increased from 3725 mL on day \u20138 to 7425 mL on day \u20133 and the serum creatinine increased from 75 \u00b5mol/L on day \u20137 to 155 \u00b5mol/L on day \u20133. His serum sodium also increased to a peak of 155 mmol/L on day \u20132. During this time, the patient only complained of mild nausea. Vital signs were stable. Forced diuresis with furosemide was suspended and oral hydration was optimized.\nOn day \u20131, the patient started complaining of polyuria, nocturia and thirst. However, he could not drink, since he had severe mucositis and odynophagia due to his chemotherapy, which led him to be put on total parenteral nutrition a few days after. A nephrology consultation request was made. Laboratory studies revealed the following values: random urine sodium 56 mmol/L; random urine osmolality 307 mOsm/kg and specific urine gravity from urinalysis 1.006. Despite the normal range of urine osmolality, the nephrologist team suspected a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) along with concomitant dehydration in absence of other identified causes of polyuria. However, no water deprivation test or desmopressin challenge was done since the patient had developed an acute kidney injury (AKI), and required fluids for his hypernatremia and his upcoming HCT. After the HCT, the patient\u2019s infusion was first switched to 0.45% sodium chloride and subsequently to dextrose 5%. Serum sodium levels showed little improvement while fluid balance improved but remained negative. On day 5, desmopressin 1 mcg was administered subcutaneously with no effect on diuresis. The following day, a desmopressin (4 mcg) challenge was administered intravenously and showed a 33% increase from baseline urine osmolality of 204 mOsm/kg to an average of 277 mOsm/kg with a decrease in diuresis. These values were compatible with a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. The patient remained polyuric and highly dependent on fluids due to his hypernatremia. Since he was partially responsive to the desmopressin challenge, intranasal desmopressin was started on day 8. The dose was increased until it reached desmopressin 40 mcg twice daily intranasally on day 11 (). A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was then performed on day 12 to rule out central lymphomatous infiltrates, which came back negative and therefore reinforced a diagnosis of partial NDI. On day 13, his natremia returned to normal range along with diuresis decreased to 600-800 cc/8 h, intravenous dextrose 5% was stopped. Desmopressin was weaned off and then stopped on day 15. By then, the patient\u2019s nocturia had markedly improved and NDI was considered resolved. On day 18, the patient was discharged from the hospital.

{"clinical_note": "A 38-year-old woman, 32+ 2 weeks pregnant, previous smoker with a past history of one miscarriage and livedo reticularis was admitted to the emergency department (ED) of her local hospital due to a sudden onset of pain, cold and functional impotence of the lower limbs. During the obstetric evaluation, fetal death was observed.\nGiven the suspicion of lower limb ischemia, low weight molecular heparin was started, and the patient was transferred to our hospital, which has vascular surgery. On admission in our ED, she was alert and oriented, hemodynamically stable and presented with tachypnea. Absence of pulses, cold and pallor of the lower limbs, with minimal neurosensory deficit and muscle weakness were observed. Laboratory workup showed hypocapnia, thrombocytopenia, elevation of liver and pancreatic enzymes, elevated total creatinine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Table resumes clinical and laboratory evolution during hospitalization. The Computed Tomography angiography (Angio CT) showed bilateral (central and lobar) pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and left iliac axis, areas of splenic and right kidney infarction and multiple arterial and venous thrombosis. Juxta-renal aortic thrombosis (Fig. ) was also observed as well as thrombosis of the left renal artery (with hypocaptation of the left kidney), right common iliac artery, left hypogastric artery, left common femoral artery, right deep femoral artery and right tibioperoneal trunk (Fig. ).\nAs lower limb ischemia was tolerated (acute limb ischemia - grade IIA), surgery was postponed. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) where presumptive CAPS diagnosis was made and anticoagulation with unfractioned heparin infusion was started. Despite anticoagulation, the patient presented worsening of neurosensory deficit and muscle weakness (acute limb ischemia - grade IIB), with the need of urgent revascularization surgery. Under general anesthesia, a cesarean section was performed to extract the dead fetus, and intrauterine balloon tamponade was placed for control of postpartum hemorrhage, followed by bilateral thromboembolectomy of the lower limbs and axillary-bifemoral bypass with synthetic prosthesis. Surgery was uneventful. Fetus had no anatomical abnormalities and weighed 1540 g. The patient recovered both lower limb perfusion as well as bilateral femoral, popliteal and distal pulses and was extubated the next day. During her stay in the ICU, the patient maintained therapeutic anticoagulation, underwent a total of six sessions of plasmapheresis and the first dose of rituximab (1000 mg) was administered. Under this treatment, an evident improvement was observed: the platelet count, hepatic enzymes and serum creatinine normalized. On the sixth day of hospitalization, she was transferred to an intermediate care unit at the hospital of her residence area where she continued TPE until the 14th day, when the second dose of rituximab was administered. After those treatments, the patient was discharged with a vitamin K antagonist.

Histological examination of the placenta showed areas of small vessel infarction.\nSix months after discharge, the patient has resumed her day-to-day life activities. She remains under warfarin therapy and the bypass is functional, with distal pulses maintained and without intermittent claudication. Additional workup was repeated and continued to be negative for aPL (even with the patient taking warfarin, which could cause a false positive lupus anticoagulant) and other autoimmune diseases (including SLE, vasculitis and sarcoidosis), with normal complement counts (C3, C4 and CH50) as well as negative for thrombophilia, cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and infectious diseases (negative for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr and toxoplasmosis).

{"clinical_note": "A 24-year-old man was admitted to our hospital 48 h after developing an acute retrosternal chest pain that was radiated to the upper back, associated with multiple episodes of vomit (food content), and progressive dyspnea. Additionally, he describes intermittent difficulty swallowing solid food. His medical history is significant for well-controlled asthma using salbutamol as needed.\nInitial evaluation revealed a temperature of 38.4 degrees; blood pressure, 100/60 mmHg; heart rate, 118/min; respiratory rate, 26/min, and SpO2, 94% on room air. Additionally, the physical examination showed subcutaneous emphysema in the cervical and thoracic regions, shallow breathing, dullness to percussion in both lung bases. His investigation results on admission revealed white blood cell count of 21,000/\u03bcL (91% Neutrophils), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin were 39.2 mg/dL and 9 ng/mL respectively. Liver and renal function were normal. The patient was admitted with sepsis of unclear etiology, although there was a suspicious for esophageal perforation predisposing mediastinitis and sepsis.\nA contrast-enhanced thoracic computed tomography (CT), showed a pneumomediastinum, cervical emphysema, bilateral pleural effusion, as well as extraluminal oral contrast surrounding the distal portion of the gastro-esophageal junction region and fluid-air level indicating a collection in the posterior mediastinum (Fig. a\u2013d). Initial management included intravenous fluid, nothing per oral (NPO), broad spectrum antibiotics, and analgesia. Due to the clinical condition of the patient, time of the rupture and inaccessibility to an intensive care unit due to the Covid 19 pandemic situation, the thoracic surgery and gastroenterology teams decided a nonoperative approach based on endoscopic therapy. The patient underwent endoscopy that showed a distal esophageal lineal tear just above Z line of approximately 4 cm with irregular edges. Irrigation and drainage of food debris of the cavity was performed before a distal auto-expandable esophageal prosthesis SX-ELLA (ELLA-CS) of 25 mm \u00d7 18 mm \u00d7 15 cm with antimigration technology and anti-reflux valve was placed (Fig. ). The thoracic surgeon decided to put a bilateral pleural tube oriented toward the perforation preventing future complications. Biopsies of the esophageal mucosa were obtained confirming the clinical suspicion of eosinophilic esophagitis (Fig. a).\nFive days after admission, a new endoscopic procedure was performed, showing migration of the esophageal stent into the stomach, a persistent perforation defect in the lower third of the esophagus with granulation tissue and two small cavities suggesting a fistulous tract. A fistulogram was performed confirming the fistulous tract between the esophagus and the pleura (Fig. a, b). Based on these findings and previous case reports found in the literature it was decided to place an endoluminal vacuum-assisted closure with sponge in the area of perforation with the fistula (Fig. c\u2013e) to control both complications. The sponge was cutted to 7 cm, adjusted and grasped with a tripod equipped endoscope and introduced in the cavity under direct visualization. After placement of the sponge, a vacuum device was connected and set to a continuous 125 mmHg sub-atmospheric, moderate intensity pressure.\nIn the second intervention for dressing change of the sponge, two OVESCO clips (OTSC\u00ae) were placed as a strategy to reduce the size of the tear and closure of the fistula, reducing up to 30% of the longitudinal size. The patient required four additional dressing changes of endoscopic vacuum-assisted closure with sponge, each one performed every 72 h, until the fistulogram showed resolution of the esophago-pleural fistulous tract (Fig. a\u2013c).\nDespite good progress of the esophago-pleural fistula, the patient condition got worse due Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite appropriate antibiotic treatment, and resucitacion with fluids the patient developed shock with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring vasopressor support and mechanical ventilation with neuromuscular blockade. The gastroenterology team decided to place a new esophageal prothesis in order to avoid dressing changes of the sponge and worsening of the clinical condition. Considering Clostridium difficile infection, a recto-sigmoidoscopy was performed which reported ischemic colitis and pseudomembranes. Due to lack of improvement despite treatment due to uncontrolled foci of infectious (colon), an emergency left hemicolectomy and a Hartmann\u2019s procedure were performed.\nOver the next 7 days, the patient condition improved, allowing to perform an endoscopy with fistulogram that showed a recurrent fistulous esophago-pleural tract (Fig. a). The esophageal prothesis was removed and a new vacuum-assisted closure with sponge was placed. Three dressing changes of endoscopic vacuum-assisted closure with sponge were performed before esophago-pleural fistula resolution was evident (Fig. b, c). The sponge and the OTSC\u00ae was retired due to a complete fistula resolution.\nA follow-up endoscopy performed 3 days after the last vacuum-assisted closure with sponge was removed, that showed epithelized esophageal mucosa with granulation tissue (Fig. d). After 46 days the patient was discharged with outpatient follow-up.\nTwo months later, the patient was asymptomatic, tolerating solids in the diet. A prednisone base therapy and food elimination diet were initiated as a measure of control of his eosinophilic esophagitis.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

He reported that, after an episode of severe chest pain, he was not aware of his surroundings and lost control over his truck for a few seconds. The truck went off the road but fortunately no one was injured. The patient had no previous history of heart disease, and no cough or pleuritic pain. There was no history of alcohol or cigarette use.\nPhysical examination was normal except for hypertension (blood pressure 160/100 mm Hg) and low-grade fever with axillary temperature of 37.5 \u00b0C. He was admitted to hospital. Initially he was investigated for an acute coronary syndrome. Echocardiogram findings and serum troponin levels were normal. On the second days of his admission, he experienced one episode of bloody vomiting. On further questioning, his physicians learned that the patient had pain on swallowing. They also discovered that he was taking ceftriaxone injections and Doxycycline 100 mg capsules twice per day for four days. The medications were prescribed in another health facility for a febrile illness. The patient had no prior history of esophageal disease.\nA gastroenterologist was consulted and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. There were multiple mucosal ulcerations in the proximal and middle esophagus (Figs. and ) as well as at the lower esophageal sphincter. In addition, hyperemia and erosions were seen in both stomach and duodenum. Mild bleeding was noted.\nLaboratory tests were normal except for a mild transient elevation of liver transaminases and a triglyceride level of 243 mg per deciliter. Serum albumin and bilirubin were normal. Hepatitis B surface antigen and Weil flex test were positive. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed increased echogenicity of the liver consistent with liver steatosis and fatty liver. There were no features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension. Chest X-ray, Complete blood count, blood film, and fasting blood sugar were all normal. H.Pylori stool antigen test, Hepatitis C. Virus and HIV antibody tests were negative. Diagnosis of Doxycycline-induced esophageal ulcerations was made, and doxycycline was discontinued. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone one gram intravenous twice daily to complete the course of treatment for the acute febrile illness and omeprazole 40 mg intravenous twice daily. He was also given antacid suspension orally. Parenteral analgesics were added as required. The pain and fever subsided gradually and the patient was discharged improved after 6 days, on omeprazole 20 mg orally twice daily for four weeks. He was advised to swallow pills in upright position and with water to prevent recurrence of similar problems. After 3 weeks, the patient returned for follow-up. He was asymptomatic. Liver transaminases were normal. Hepatitis B. Viral DNA level was 99 international unit per milliliter. Hepatitis e antigen was negative. Antiviral treatment was not indicated and the patient was linked to care for his hypertension and chronic hepatitis B infection.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

He had a history of mild hypertension for 1 year with treatment of amlodipine 2.5 mg/d and poorly-controlled asthma. On examination, he showed completed bilateral horizontal gaze palsy which was uncorrected by vestibuloocular reflex. Gazed-evoked upbeat nystagmus (UBN) was observed on attempted upward gaze but not on straight-ahead gaze position. In addition, he had bilateral peripheral facial paralysis with predominance on the left. Examination on other cranial nerves, including facial sensation, taste, hearing, and pharyngeal reflex, were normal. Mild ataxia was noticed on the left upper extremity when performing finger-to-nose test. His muscle strength was 5 on four limbs and he had normal pinprick sensation and brisk tendon reflexes. Brain MRI revealed hyperintensity in right middle cerebellar peduncle and bilateral dorsal pontine tegmentum on diffusion-weighted image, indicating new infarction (Fig. a). No periventricular white matter lesions were observed. CT angiography of vertebrobasilar artery showed no evidence of significant stenosis (Fig. b). CSF examination showed normal protein level and CSF analysis for oligoclonal band, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody, and aquaporin-4 antibody were negative. Contrast-enhanced transcranial doppler showed > 50 microbubbles during the Valsava maneuver, suggesting potential cardiac right-to-left shunt. Further transoesophageal echocardiography revealed patent foramen ovale (PFO; Fig. c) with a tunnel length of 12.6 mm. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed left atrial diameter of 32 mm and left ventricular ejection fraction of 70.4%. No left ventricle hypertrophy or atrial septal aneurysm was observed. Holter monitor examination in hospital did not capture remarkable arrhythmias, i.e. atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. Rrivaroxaban 15 mg/d was prescribed at discharge and closure of PFO was then administrated.

{"clinical_note": "A 69-year-old Han man complained of chest distress and shortness of breath after stress for four months. He was diagnosed with hypertension for four months, and he felt that these symptoms were accompanied by high blood pressure. The maximum blood pressure measured was 200/110 mmHg. Benidipine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily), metoprolol succinate (47.5 mg Qd), furosemide (20 mg Qd) and spironolactone (20 mg Qd) were applied to control blood pressure. In addition, he had a dull pain in his left waist for four months. Abdominal enhanced computerised tomography (CT) demonstrated a suspected left renal infarction. His past medical history included 10 years of diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. During this hospitalization, he was diagnosed with resistant hypertension with chronic renal disease and renal dysfunction (creatinine 122 \u00b5mol/L, eGFR = 51.80 mL/min \u00d7 1.73 m2). Abdominal enhanced CT was reperformed and showed that his left renal artery was nearly occluded, his right renal artery had mild to moderate stenosis and his left kidney had atrophied. An invasive angiography with angiographic catheter JR 4.0 further demonstrated a 95% stenosis of the proximal segment of the left renal artery, and the middle segment was blurred with multi-channel-like blood flow (Fig. , Additional file ). An RDC guiding catheter was used and run through across the lesion. The proximal lesion was pre-dilated by a 4.0 mm \u00d7 15 mm balloon at 10 atm. A commercially available IVUS system (iLAB, Boston Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, Massachusetts) was used to acquire IVUS images. A 40 MHz, 2.6 F imaging catheter (Atlantis SR Pro or Pro 2, Boston Scientific) was advanced distal to the lesion, and an automated pullback was performed at a speed of 0.5 mm/s. Multiple lumens and HLS were demonstrated by IVUS, and the cavity was surrounded by fibrous tissue (Fig. , Additional file ). A lesion of the middle segment of the left renal artery was sequentially dilated by a 1.5 \u00d7 15 mm balloon, 2.5 \u00d7 10 mm balloon and 4.0 \u00d7 15 mm balloon at 8\u201312 atm, and an express SD 5.0 \u00d7 19 mm stent was implanted at 12 atm successfully, overlapping with the proximal segment of the left renal artery (Fig. , Additional file ).

{"clinical_note": "A 14-month-old Congolese male child with oculocutaneous albinism visited the Mbujimayi pediatric clinic with fever and fatigue. He was originally from Kasai Oriental, a region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He was the youngest in a family of five children, three of whom had oculocutaneous albinism. He himself has sickle cell disease and the rest of the siblings have a sickle cell trait (Fig. ). He was born at term with a birth weight of 3000 g, and presented with spontaneously resolutive neonatal jaundice. The other significant history was episodes of fever with a monthly frequency of two episodes. No vaso-occlusive crisis was clearly diagnosed, in particular no dactylitis episode was reported. The vaccination schedule according to the expanded program of immunization in the DRC was respected with Bacille Calmette et Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis; diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) vaccine; oral polio vaccine (OPV) against polio; hepatitis B and haemophilus influenzae vaccine (HepB-HiB1); rotavirus vaccine (Rotasiil1); pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar); measles vaccine (VAR); and yellow fever vaccine (AAV). The patient has never been hospitalized and has always been treated on an outpatient basis in health centers during febrile episodes such as malaria or typhoid fever. The siblings reported no particular clinical history.\nHis parents are not albinos and have no specific medical history; they never benefited from a prenuptial test. They reported their fear of the judgment of others because they have albino children when they are not affected.\nThe patient was wide awake with good contact and interaction. Generalized pallor was noted with subicteric conjunctivae, and the irises were bluish gray and translucent, thus appearing red with nystagmus (Fig. ). The patient\u2019s skin was pinkish white, depigmented, without any particular lesions or bruises.\nOn physical examination, weight and height were at the third and tenth percentile for age, respectively. There was no fever (temperature 36.5 \u00b0C), the respiratory rate was high (53 cycles/minute), as well as the heart rate (176 beats/minute), but the latter was regular with the presence of a 1/6 systolic murmur at the mitral focus. The oxygen saturation was 94%. The oral examination was normal. The lymph nodes were free, without lymphadenopathy. The lung examination was normal. The abdomen was supple and painless. There was stage III splenomegaly according to the Hackett classification. Laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 48 g/L and white blood cells at 13,200/\u03bcl (complete blood count performed with the Sysmex poch-100i; Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany).\nThe diagnosis of SCD has been suggested on the basis of pallor, jaundice, and severe anemia. It was confirmed first by a positive rapid test (BioMedomics, Inc, Morrisville, USA) and then by hemoglobin electrophoresis.\nThe diagnosis of albinism was proven by molecular genetics on a blood sample and identification of the mutation involved, that is homozygosity for the 2.7 kb deletion of OCA2 (laboratory \u201cCentro Nacional de Biotecnologia CNB-CSIC Campus de Cantoblanco, Darwin 3, 28049 Madrid, Spain). A family investigation was then performed (see Fig. ).\nGiven the very low hemoglobin level, the patient\u2019s age, and SCD, a blood transfusion was indicated. Antibiotic treatment (ceftriaxone and amikacin) was started in the hospital. The evolution was favorable. On discharge from hospital, routine prophylaxis with folic acid and oral penicillin was initiated, and advice on crisis prevention and medical monitoring was given to the parents.\nA dedicated patient monitoring program has been set up for sickle cell anemia and albinism with hygiene advice and sun protection measures. The patient received a hat, sunglasses, and sun protection cream. Ophthalmologic follow-up has also been set up. The evolution remains dermatologically stable, no skin lesion was observed. For SCD, the patient received treatment with hydroxyurea since early 2020. It is still too early to objectify the benefit of this therapy but he had only one infectious episode, one vaso-occlusive crisis, and did not require blood transfusion for over a year.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "A girl presented with asymptomatic proteinuria, which was revealed by a urinary screening test performed in Japan when she was 3 years old. She had no family history of renal or neurological disorders. The urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) was 1.0\u20131.5 g/gCr (reference range < 0.2 g/gCr) at that time. Ultrasonography revealed normal echogenicity in both kidneys. She developed nephrotic syndrome, without systemic edema, at the age of 8 years. Polyuria and polydipsia with a urine output of 3L in a day were also documented. UPCR was 11.5 g/gCr, and the serum albumin level was 2.1 g/dL (reference range 3.7\u20135.5 g/dL). The serum creatinine level was 0.97 mg/dL (eGFR was 46.8 mL/min/1.73m2). The urine specific gravity was 1.008, and urinary beta 2-microglobulin increased to 9,269 \u00b5g/L (reference range \u2264 150 \u03bcg/L). A kidney biopsy revealed that 13 (52%) of 25 glomeruli showed segmental or global sclerosis. Furthermore, two glomeruli showed cellular lesions, which were characterized by swollen, vacuolated, and proliferative glomerular epithelial cells, throughout Bowman\u2019s space. The underlying glomerular capillaries were partially collapsed and occluded by swollen endothelial cells and karyorrhexis, which was consistent with a pathological diagnosis of FSGS (Fig. A) []. No glomeruli with collapse and overlying podocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia were not observed. Cystic dilatations of the tubules and interstitial fibrosis were also observed (Fig. B). The patient presented with no neurological manifestations, such as seizures or developmental delays. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram detected no abnormalities. She could hold her head up at 4 months old, sit at 8 months old, pull up to stand at 9 moths and speak single words at 1 year and 6 months old. She did not need special support to attend school. Her renal function continued to deteriorate, and she eventually developed ESRD, despite the administration of angiotensin receptor blockers. At 9 years of age, pre-emptive kidney transplantation was performed, with a kidney donated by her mother. No recurrence of proteinuria has been observed for 1 year and 9 months after transplantation.\nWe performed whole-exome analysis using a previously described method [], focusing on variants in the genes that are currently known to cause FSGS or nephronophthisis (Tables S and S), and identified a de novo novel heterozygous C to A transition (c.1461C > A) in the last exon of TRIM8, resulting in a premature stop codon (p.Tyr487*). The alternative and reference allele counts were 68 (46%) and 80 (54%), respectively. Sanger sequencing showed that the individual had the variant but that her parents did not. This variant was absent in population databases including the Exome Aggregation Consortium database (ExAC, ), Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, ), 1000 Genomes (1000G, ), ESP6500 (). No additional pathogenic variants in the genes that are currently known to cause FSGS or nephronophthisis were identified (Tables S and S). This variant was classified as pathogenic (PVS1, PM1, PM2, PM6, and PP4) based on the criteria developed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics [].\nThe sequence analysis of mRNA was performed as previouly reported methods []. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The RNA was treated with DNase (QIAGEN) to avoid genomic DNA contamination, and 200 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for the mRNA analysis. The following primers were used to amplify and sequence exon 6 of TRIM8 from cDNA: 5\u2019-GAGTGTCCCCCTGTACCCTT -3\u2019 (forward) and 5\u2019-CTACAGGGTGTATGGGCAGC-3\u2019 (reverse). Polymerase chain reaction experiments were performed, using Invitrogen Platinum II Taq Hot-Start DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and T100TM Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) identifing mRNA sequences transcribed from the TRIM8 mutant allele (Fig. ), which confirmed the escape from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) [].\nImmunohistochemical analysis were performed using the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded kidney biopsy specimens obtained from the present patient and nine control individuals consisting of three living kidney transplantation donors who served as normal controls, five patients with primary FSGS and one patient with nephronophthisis who served as disease controls. We performed autoclave-based antigen retrieval, for 15 min at 105 \u00b0C, in Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 (Leica Biosystems Newcastle, Ltd., Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK). Specimens were incubated with goat polyclonal antibody against an epitope corresponding to amino acids 540\u2013551, at the C-terminus of human TRIM8 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; catalog no. ab4302), overnight, at a dilution of 1:500 []. Immunofluorescence staining, using the anti-TRIM8 antibody in normal control specimens, is shown in Fig. (Fig. A\u2013E). TRIM8 expression was observed in the nuclei of all glomerular cells (Fig. A\u2013C). Double immunostaining with mouse anti-human podocalyxin monoclonal antibody (PHM5, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), at a dilution of 1:100 which was used as a podocyte marker (Fig. B) [] and mouse anti-human cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) monoclonal antibody (QBEND/10, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), at a dilution of 1:40 which was used as an endothelial cell marker (Fig. C) [] showed that TRIM8 was expressed in the nuclei of podocytes and endothelial cells, respectively. Proximal tubular cells that were identified by mouse anti-human cluster of differentiation 10 (CD10) monoclonal antibody (56C6, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) without dilution [] and distal tubular cells that were identified by mouse anti-human epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) monoclonal antibody (Clone E29, Dako, Santa Clara, California, USA) without dilution [] also showed the nuclear expression of TRIM8 protein (Fig. D and ). Similar findings were observed in specimens from disease controls (Fig. S). In contrast, the present patient showed a lack of TRIM8 protein expression in any cells in the glomeruli and tubules (Fig. F\u2013J). The tubules showing cystic dilatation were positive for EMA, but negative for CD10, indicating that cystic dilatation was evident in the distal tubules (Fg. I and ). IHC staining, using anti-SOCS1 goat polyclonal antibody (Abcam, catalog no. ab9870), at a dilution of 1:500 [] of the kidney biopsy specimens derived from the present patient showed stronger cytoplasmic SOCS1 expression in glomerular and tubular cells than observed in control samples (Fig. S).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 71-year-old male was admitted to the hospital due to productive cough along with low grade fever, chest pain and shortness of breath. His past medical history included hypertension and glaucoma, and he took irbesartan regularly (150 mg per day). The patient did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. No relevant travel history or contact history were detected. The patient had no food or drug allergies.\nThree weeks before admission, the patient began to have productive cough, with chest tightness and a temperature of 38 \u00b0C. After 2 weeks of progressive symptoms, the patient visited the local hospital. He reported pleuritic chest pain of visual analogue scale score 2. His vital signs and other physical examination results were reported as normal. Initial blood test showed elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (14.8 \u00d7 109/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level (86 mg/L) as well as liver enzyme elevation. Other laboratory test results were normal. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed patchy opacities in both lower lobes and a small amount of right-sided pleural effusion. He was then admitted to the local hospital and received intravenous sulperazon (cefperazone\u2013sulbactam) 2.0 g once every 8 h, but symptomatic improvement was not noted. Repeated chest CT scan revealed increased pleural effusion in the right. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to our hospital for treatment.\nOn the admission, his temperature was 37.8 \u00b0C, pulse rate 109 beats/min, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, blood pressure 145/87 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The patient reported no night sweats, weight loss, joint pains, or myalgias. Pulmonary auscultation found decreased breath sounds on both lower fields. No icterus or lymphadenopathy was detected. Thoracocentesis was performed immediately and a chest tube was introduced. Purulent and hemorrhagic fluid was aspirated (Fig. A), and laboratory tests of the pleural effusion revealed an exudate (fluid protein 25.70 g/L, serum protein 28.70 g/L [normal: 35.0\u201355.0 g/L], fluid lactate dehydrogenase 621 U/L, serum lactate dehydrogenase 355 U/L [normal < 243 U/L]). Other pleural fluid analysis showed: WBC 5000/\u00b5L with 88% neutrophils, red blood cells 21,000/\u00b5L, fluid glucose 7.31 mmol/L, and fluid adenosine deaminase 18 U/L. Pleural fluid smear, gram stain, bacterial culture, acid-fast bacilli culture and smear, and cytology were all negative. Blood culture was also negative. He was diagnosed as empyema and intravenous tazocin (piperacillin-tazobactam) 4.5 g once every 8 h was initiated.\nDuring the treatment, repeated blood and fluid cultures were all negative, so the pleural effusion was sent for NGS. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted directly from the pleural fluid. The extracted DNA was amplified, purified, and sonicated to a size of 200\u2013300 bp. Fragmented DNA was end repaired to construct DNA libraries, and supplemented with adapter overnight followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Qualified DNA libraries were sequenced using the BGISEQ-100 platform. We generated high-quality sequencing data by removing low-quality reads, low-complexity reads, and reads shorter than 35 bp. Human data were mapped to a human reference (hg19) and excluded. The remaining sequencing data were aligned to the bacterial, virus, and fungal databases. All pathogen sequence reference databases were from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) ().\nNGS identified 14 out of 19317 reads uniquely corresponding to S. constellatus. Although the number of the reads was small, S. constellatus was the only pathogen detected. Tazocin was used continuously for 12 days, then followed by moxifoxacin 400 mg per day for a total of 14 days. Meanwhile, the pleural effusion was drained continuously through the chest tube.

{"clinical_note": "A 25-year-old woman, without previous medical history, presented for infertility lasting for more than one year. Clinical examination was normal but abdominal and pelvic computed tomodensitometry (CT) revealed a cyst of the left ovary associated with abundant peritoneal ascites that could correspond to mucinous material. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed ascites and showed a heterogeneous mass of the left ovary measuring 8.4 \u00d7 6.8 cm with adipose, solid and cystic regions that were suggestive of a dermoid cyst. The right ovary and uterus seemed normal. No other lesion was seen in the rest of the body, notably in the digestive system. In this context, surgery by left oophorectomy with appendicectomy and omentectomy was performed 3 months after the first consultation, without resorting to additional hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Intra-operative examination revealed mucinous material inside the peritoneal cavity and a normal digestive tract with a normal appendix. There was no complication of the surgery. The 5-month follow-up based on clinical and imaging surveillance revealed no complaints. Without relapse, the patient was able to pursue her plan to have a child.\nMacroscopically, the left ovary was cystic measuring 9.5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 cm and weighing 305 g. It was ruptured on 4 cm. Its cut section revealed a heterogeneous and viscous mass with hair. The appendix, measuring 6 cm in length, and the omentum were macroscopically normal. Histologically, the ovarian cyst corresponded to a mature pluritissular teratoma with intermingled skin and pilosebaceous annexes, serous and mucinous glands, respiratory epithelium, adipose tissue and smooth muscle (Fig. ). The organoid areas with the aspect of a colon, representing about 20% of the ovarian cyst, were composed of colonic mucosa, muscularis mucosae, and submucosa from the surface to the depth. A thick muscularis propria was also observed. In the colonic mucosa, some glands were elongated and layered with moderate proliferating epithelial cells with minimal atypia, near to mucin pools stained with Alcian blue. The colonic epithelial cells were immunohistochemistry stained with CK20 and CDX2, and showed heterogeneous staining for CK7. These cells were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors (Fig. ). The ovarian surface was covered with hyperplastic mesothelial cells and presented acellular mucinous pools, also found in the omentum. The left fallopian tube was normal. The appendix examined in totality was histologically normal besides mucin deposits on the surface of the serosa. It did not present any mucocele or LAMN/HAMN. All together, these data suggested a diagnosis of acellular PMP (according to Carr classification []) caused by a ruptured appendiceal-like mucocele associated with LAMN, in a left ovarian teratoma.\nNext generation sequencing of the LAMN of the teratomatous mucocele revealed an activating mutation of KRAS gene c.35G > A corresponding to the p.(Gly12Asp) substitution (Fig. ). Complementary molecular analysis by SNaPshot showed an associated mutation of GNAS c.602G > A resulting in p.(Arg201His). No mutation was found by these two techniques on the other tissues of the ovarian teratoma (squamous, respiratory, adipose or smooth muscle elements) or in the normal appendix and ovarian parenchyma (Fig. ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 45-year-old woman presented to pulmonary clinic for evaluation of worsening dyspnea, cough, and hypoxemia. Her medical history was significant for limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) (Fig. A). She had no history of atopy or food allergies and used an albuterol inhaler as needed. PAH had been diagnosed seven years prior to presentation when she had a reported pulmonary artery (PA) pressure of 80/39 mmHg, mean PA pressure of 56 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 12 mmHg, and cardiac output by thermodilution of 3.17 L/min. Her pulmonary function tests (PFTs) at that time showed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.06 L (75% predicted) and a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 19.61 mL/min/mm Hg (66% predicted). Per her medical records and history, the patient had been treated with dual therapy (tadalafil and macitentan) for PAH and was subsequently able to wean from oxygen supplementation that she had previously required, indicating a therapeutic response. Her ILD was considered mild, and she did not require supplemental oxygen at rest or with exertion. She was treated with mycophenolate mofetil for a year after her initial diagnosis, but the patient discontinued this medication about 6 years prior to presentation due to fear of reactivating remote Lyme infection after she had read about chronic Lyme disease on the internet. The patient had been stable on her regimen of tadalafil and macitentan until 3 months prior to presentation when she began to experience rapidly progressive dyspnea and new onset hypoxemia. Right heart catheterization (RHC) revealed that her PAH had worsened with a mean PA pressure of 72 mmHg and a new drop in cardiac index (1.7 L/min/m2), requiring initiation of subcutaneous treprostinil.\nAdditional history revealed she had taken oral helminth therapy as an alternative treatment for lcSSc. She ingested Necator americanus larvae on 3 separate occasions, 12 weeks apart, with an increasing number of helminths with each dose (3, 5, and 15 larvae). She experienced abdominal pain and diarrhea after the first ingestion. Her respiratory symptoms started 6 weeks after the third and largest dose of helminths.\nIn the clinic, patient appeared to be in mild respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and she required 6\u20138 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain saturations above 90%. She was tachycardic (104 beats/min) with a loud second heart sound, jugular venous distension, and severe lower extremity pitting edema up to her thighs. Auscultation of the chest revealed bibasilar rales. Dermatologic exam was notable for scattered telangiectasias over her face, arms, and hands.\nComplete blood count showed leukocytosis (13.5 \u00d7 103/uL) with 10% eosinophils (absolute count of 0.98 \u00d7 103 cells/uL). Of note, prior blood counts from 2017 had shown normal eosinophil counts (291 \u00d7 103 cells/uL). Basic metabolic profile was significant for an elevated creatinine (1.31 mg/dL) but was otherwise normal. Serum brain natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 578 ng/L. IgE was also elevated at 1372.9 IU/mL, and IgG antibodies to Strongyloides were detected. Multiple stool analyses were negative for ova and parasites. PFTs at that time revealed an FVC of 2.03 L (49% predicted), a decline of over 1.0 L since her prior testing; complete testing was not possible due to her respiratory symptoms.\nHigh resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest showed worsened subpleural reticulations, traction bronchiectasis, and diffuse ground glass opacities suggesting chronic pulmonary fibrosis in a pattern consistent with non-specific interstitial pneumonia. The patient\u2019s CT scan revealed progressive ILD and showed new diffuse ground glass opacities compared imaging from four years prior (Fig. A\u2013D). There were also signs of decompensated right heart failure, including markedly enlarged dilated right heart chambers, pericardial effusion, and flattening of the interventricular septum (Fig. E). Though some of the ground glass opacities could have been consistent with pulmonary edema or parenchymal inflammation, additional areas had tract-like abnormalities leading to pleural edge, atypical for either of those entities [] and not conforming to normal pulmonary vasculature (Fig. D).\nImmediately after her disclosure of the ingestion of parasites, the patient was treated with albendazole and corticosteroids for presumed L\u00f6ffler\u2019s syndrome with transient improvement in her dyspnea and hypoxemia. However, due to progressive hypoxemia and signs of decompensated right heart failure on her examination at her outpatient visit, she was admitted to the hospital.\nTransthoracic echocardiogram revealed preserved left ventricular function but severely dilated right sided chambers, with a right ventricular systolic pressure estimated at 90 mmHg. Repeat RHC revealed persistently elevated mean PA pressure of 73 mmHg, worsened PCWP of 17 mmHg, and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance of 11.5 Wood units. Due to rapid decompensation and severity of hypoxemia, bronchoscopy was not able to be performed.\nRespiratory failure progressed, with the development of refractory hypoxemia and right heart failure that did not respond to aggressive medical therapy in the intensive care unit, including intravenous diuresis and treprostinil as well as inhaled epoprostenol. She was emergently evaluated for lung transplantation but was not offered listing due to her comorbidities, which included severe esophageal dysmotility and renal dysfunction. Her respiratory status continued to deteriorate despite aggressive medical intervetion, and the patient decided to transition to comfort-focused care. She passed away shortly thereafter, and post-mortem examination was declined by her family.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 36-year-old woman presented to a local hospital with a history of neck pain. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a tumor arising from the anterior elements of the C1 and C2 vertebrae. Cervical spine fusion and mass reduction surgery were performed. The resected specimen showed diffuse proliferation of plasma cells and was diagnosed as \u201cplasmacytoma\u201d at that time. Additional radiotherapy was performed, but the patient later dropped out from the treatment course.\nSixteen years later, at the age of 52 years, the patient returned complaining of dysarthria. CT and MRI showed a similar but much larger mass at the same location, and recurrence of the tumor was diagnosed (Fig. ). The mass compressed the spinal cord and was thought to be responsible for the dysarthria. The patient was referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. Quantitative serum Ig analysis showed an increased level of IgG (2096 mg/dl; reference range 870\u20131700 mg/dl) and normal levels of IgM (203 mg/dl; reference range 46\u2013260 mg/dl) and IgA (293 mg/dl; reference range 110\u2013410 mg/dl). A serum Ig-free light chain study revealed increased levels of both free kappa light chain (61.5 mg/l; reference range 2.42\u201318.92 mg/l) and free lambda light chain (88.1 mg/l; reference range 4.44\u201326.18 mg/l) (kappa/lambda: 0.70).\nExcisional biopsy of the tumor was performed. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated a distinct population of abnormal plasma cells which were positive for CD56 (96%), CD38 (70%), CD45 (9%), and CD19 (1%). Approximately 96% of these tumor cells co-expressed cytoplasmic kappa and lambda light chain based on a CD38-positive gate strategy (Fig. ). Histologically, the specimen showed diffuse proliferation of plasmacytoid tumor cells with pale paranuclear area and dense chromatin, and immunohistochemistry showed that these tumor cells were strongly and diffusely positive for CD138 (Fig. a, b) and MUM1, and negative for CD3, CD20, and CD56. Immunohistochemistry for IgL demonstrated co-expression of kappa and lambda light chain (Fig. c, d). Additionally, we demonstrated in situ hybridization (ISH) targeting IgL mRNA using FFPE specimen, and ISH also revealed that tumor cells co-expressed kappa and lambda light chain (Fig. e, f). Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of plasmacytes showing dual expression or deviation of kappa and lambda light chain, and additional CT and MRI revealed no skeletal abnormality except for the primary lesion, and absence of end-organ damage attributable to a proliferative plasma cell disorder.\nWe reviewed the previous specimen and performed additional IgL immunohistochemistry. The sample revealed a histological pattern similar to that of the later sample as well as co-expression of kappa and lambda light chain (Additional file : Fig. S1).\nTaking these findings together, the tumor was diagnosed as SPB with dual expression of the kappa and lambda light chains. After diagnosis, the patient underwent nine courses of VRD (bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) therapy, which reduced the size of the lesion. Two years after diagnosis, the lesions have not increased in size, and bone marrow examinations have shown no progression to PCM.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}
{"clinical_note": "In May 2021, a 19-year-old caucasian male patient was referred to the university hospital of Brandenburg owing to a severe decline of excretory kidney function. The serum creatinine concentration was 649 \u00b5mol/l (normal range 62\u2013106 \u00b5mol/l) at the time of admission (Fig. ). The patient suffered from mild dyspnea, lack of appetite, and moderate itchiness.\nThe patient did not report any known diseases, nor did he take any medication on a regular basis. Approximately 10 weeks earlier, he had an upper respiratory tract infection that did not require antibiotics or other medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Since then, he did not recover completely but instead suffered from persistent fatigue. Also, he lost 8 kg of body weight until admission. He denied fever, nausea/vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, skin abnormalities, photosensitivity, Raynaud symptoms, and hair loss. He did not report morning stiffness or lower back pain. Three weeks before admission, he noticed pain in his right eye, accompanied by redness and blurred vision. A prompt ophthalmological examination led to the diagnosis of anterior uveitis. The ocular inflammatory process was not treated in a systemic manner, particularly not with systemic steroids, antibiotics, or NSAIDs. He exclusively received steroid-containing eye-drops. One day before admission, he underwent outpatient control of several blood parameters to identify the etiology of ocular inflammation. Serum analysis showed severely deteriorated kidney function.\nAt the time of admission, he presented an overall reduced physical condition. His height was 180 cm and body weight 93 kg (BMI: 28.7). His initial blood pressure was 144/114 mmHg and heart rate 124 beats per minute. Respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturation was 99%. He had no increased body temperature. Examination of heart, lungs, and abdomen did not reveal any pathological findings, the same applied for both the central and peripheral nervous system. Abdominal skin was moderately affected by striae distensae.\nBesides impaired excretory kidney function, the patient showed moderately increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (45.7 mg/l; normal range < 5 mg/l) and elevated haptoglobin (2.6 g/l; normal range 0.3\u20132.0 g/l). Also, parathormone (PTH) was mildly elevated (72.8 pg/ml; normal range 15\u201365 pg/ml). Immune diagnostics revealed the following positive findings: anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) titer (1:160; normal range < 1:160) and anti-La (56.6; normal range < 46). Both cytoplasmic and perinuclear Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (c- and pANCA) were negative, anti-proteinase 3 was 2.3 U/mL (normal range < 10 U/mL). Light chain (LC) diagnostics showed increases of both, kappa- and lambda-LC (121 mg/l; normal range 3.3\u201319.4 mg/l, and 60.1 mg/l; normal range 5.71\u201326.3 mg/l), and the ratio differed from the normal range as well (2.01; normal range 0.26\u20131.65). Total serum immunoglobulin-G (IgG) was mildly elevated (22.1 g/L; normal range 5.49\u201315.8 g/L). Chlamydia pneumoniae-IgG (21 RE/ml; normal range < 16 RE/ml) was positive, as was serological testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) [virus-capsid antigen (VCA) EBV-IgG-antikoerper (Ak) (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) 137 RE/mL (normal range < 16 RE/mL), Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA 1)-IgG-Ak 1.02 (normal range < 80)]. Differential blood cell count showed an eosinophil percentage of 3.6% (normal range 0.5\u20137%). Other non-aberrant findings were monocytes, platelet count, and serum and urine calcium.\nSemiquantitative urine analysis showed a proteinuria of 0.25 g/l and few erythrocytes (25/\u00b5l; normal: negative). The daily proteinuria was determined to be 0.77 g (normal range < 0.15 g). Urinary eosinophils were negative.\nTransthoracic echocardiography showed a mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (50%; normal range > 60%). Diastolic function was impaired, although mild as well. The inferior part of the left ventricle was akinetic. Visually, the right ventricular function was slightly reduced. Computed tomography of thorax and abdomen revealed diffuse intraabdominal lymph node expansion. The initial ophthalmological investigation confirmed the diagnosis of unilateral anterior uveitis of the right eye. Specifically, the right conjunctiva showed perilimbical hyperemia, and the cornea was unaffected. The anterior chamber was not flattened and did not contain relevant cell numbers. Retinal investigation did not reveal any signs of inflammation.\nDue to AKI of unknown origin, we performed kidney biopsy (6 days after admission). Two samples were obtained from the left kidney. Initial ultrasound analysis showed normal organ dimensions and no signs of obstruction. The pathological investigation by an experienced renal pathologist showed interstitial inflammatory infiltrates around the tubuli mainly composed of lymphocytes (Fig. ). The findings led to the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis []. Signs of glomerular inflammation were absent. The diagnosis was tubulointerstitial nephritis with anterior uveitis (TINU) syndrome of no specific or suspected origin.\nImmediately after admission, the patient received intravenous glucocorticoids (prednisolone 250 mg daily) on three consecutive days, followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg daily for 7 days, dose reduction of 10 mg daily every 7 days thereafter) since we initially suspected an ANCA-associated autoinflammatory disease. Also, we started the patient on renal replacement therapy (RR, hemodialysis) after central vein catheter insertion into the right femoral vein. Volume depletion during individual dialysis session was not mandatory since urine production was not affected. One week after admission, the patient suffered from fever and general weakness. He received intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin and tazobactam) and was transferred to the local intensive care unit (ICU). The central vein catheter was removed since the patient showed localized pain around the insertion area, that is, signs of catheter-related blood infection. RRT was continued after establishing a new central vein catheter at the ICU. Two days after the initial fever attack, the patient developed generalized rash including moderate itchiness. The antibiotics therapy was adapted to meropenem. During the ICU stay, oral prednisolone therapy was continued as initiated. Discharge from the ICU was initiated after 3 days. The last dialysis treatment session was performed 1 week before discharge from the hospital (Fig. ). Kidney excretory function continuously improved, with a last serum creatinine concentration of 214 \u00b5mol/l. Also, the ocular manifestation resolved almost completely after local corticosteroid eye drop treatment for 7 days. The in-hospital stay lasted for nearly 3 weeks, and the further management was planned in the outpatient area.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 58-year-old Japanese woman with a 3-year history of genital ulcers and oral aphthae was admitted to our hospital. She had a history of uterine fibroids and thrombocytopenia during pregnancy. Her family history included hypertension and diabetes in her mother and MDS in her offspring. A year ago on admission, she developed abdominal pain and persistent diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed multiple colonic ulcers, and she was referred to our hospital. On physical examination, we found erythema nodosum without uveitis on the left forearm. Laboratory tests revealed macrocytic anemia (red blood cell count, 251 \u00d7 104/\u03bcl; hemoglobin level, 9.3 g/dl). White blood cell and platelet counts were 4800/\u03bcl and 14.3 \u00d7 104/\u03bcl, respectively. Serum C reactive protein levels were 0.35 mg/dl and anti-nuclear antibody was negative. Human leukocyte antigen analysis was positive for B51 and A26. Colonoscopy showed multiple, round, punched-out ulcers from the terminal ileum to the descending colon (Fig. a, ). Intestinal Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease (BD) was diagnosed, and she received 3600 mg of mesalazine, 0.5 mg of colchicine, and 30 mg of oral prednisolone per day. Adalimumab, a TNF inhibitor was also added for maintenance therapy. However, during steroid tapering, her abdominal symptoms relapsed. Persistent anemia was observed and bone marrow examination was performed. The results revealed the presence of trisomy 8, trisomy 9, and X chromosome abnormalities (48, + 8, + 9, X, i(X) (q10) in 12 out of the 20 cells examined; Fig. ). The patient\u2019s bone marrow was hypoplastic with the appearance of micromegakaryocytes and < 1% of atypical cells, resulting in the diagnosis of low-risk MDS (refractory anemia). At the age of 60, Infliximab (5 mg/kg) against refractory intestinal BD was initiated instead of Adalimumab. Infliximab was temporary effective for abdominal symptoms, however, she developed pneumonia with fever at the age of 61. Chest X-ray and lung computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs (Fig. a, ). High-resolution chest CT and histopathology via transbronchial lung biopsy revealed the presence of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (Fig. ). Her serum GM-CSF concentration was 4.3 pg/ml (normal range, < 5 pg/ml) and an anti-GM-CSF antibody was negative. Based on findings with the underlying disease, a diagnosis of SPAP was established. She was treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg) for active intestinal BD for every 4 weeks and received whole lung lavage to improve respiratory symptoms with SPAP.

{"clinical_note": "A 36-year old woman was referred to a tertiary unit at 29+5 weeks of gestation due to fetal cardiomegaly and mild ascites (Fig. a, b), which was detected on a scan undertaken for suspected small for gestational age. The woman was nulliparous with a low-risk first trimester combined screening test and unremarkable anomaly scan. She was rhesus B negative and underwent non-invasive prenatal testing that determined the rhesus genotype of the fetus to be rhesus B negative. Otherwise, no red blood cell antibodies were reported. Of note, the maternal grandmother was known to have sideroblastic anaemia that was diagnosed at 17 years of age. The mother of the unborn fetus and her brother had undergone testing as children but were told that no further follow-up was needed. Unfortunately, additional information regarding and genetic testing for this family history was not available. The woman had mild macrocytic anaemia with haemoglobin of 10.4 g/dl and a mean corpuscular volume of 104 fl. The woman had not received any preconceptional or genetic counselling.\nUpon arrival, the first scan in our department demonstrated a middle cerebral arterial (MCA) peak systolic velocity (PSV) value above 1.5 Multiples of the Median (MoM). Fetal biometry was normal, as was the amniotic fluid index and umbilical artery doppler. Dexamethasone for fetal lung maturation was administered, and an uncomplicated in utero fetal blood transfusion (IUT) was performed at 30+3 weeks of gestation. The pre-transfusion fetal haemoglobin was 4.4 g/dl, which was increased to 14.1 g/dl following 120 mL of blood transfusion through the intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein (Fig. ). Investigations to determine the underlying cause of fetal anaemia included microarray comparative genomic hybridization, serology to exclude congenital infection, a peripheral blood film and fetal bilirubin to detect haemolysis. These preliminary investigations were normal. A fetal MRI brain was performed, which showed no abnormalities. In the subsequent weeks, the MCA-PSV improved, as did the cardiomegaly.\nAt 35+3 weeks of gestation, the MCA-PSV increased to above 1.5 MoM. The options of delivery and ex-utero transfusion versus IUT were discussed with the multidisciplinary team and with parents. As it was considered that an IUT would allow pregnancy to proceed to term, it was decided to proceed with IUT. A second IUT took place with a pre-and post-transfusion fetal haemoglobin of 9.7 and 15 g/dl, respectively. The MCA-PSV remained stable until 37 weeks and three days when a caesarean section for breech presentation was planned. Fetal biometry was consistent with previous measurements, and the amniotic fluid index and umbilical artery doppler were normal. The woman was counselled regarding the need for delivery and likely need for exchange transfusion in the neonatal period. Delivery of a female infant via caesarean section due to breech presentation was performed at 37 + 4 weeks. The birth weight was 3150 g, and apgar scores were 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.\nSubsequently, the infant again became anaemic, requiring regular 3\u20134 monthly blood transfusions but she is making good developmental progress. Her anaemia was unresponsive to pyridoxine. Iron levels should be closely monitored to detect the need for chelation therapy in future care plans, since iron toxicity is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in XLSA [].\nFetal and maternal blood was collected for DNA extraction, at the time of the first IUT. DNA was sequenced by next-generation sequencing for 11 genes associated with sideroblastic anaemia. Analysis was performed using Agilent SureSelect XT custom enrichment technology and Illumina DNA sequencing. Significant maternal cell contamination of the fetal blood sample was excluded using the ABI AMPFLSTR Identifiler PCR Amplification Kit. A heterozygous variant in the ALAS2 (NM_000032.4) gene was identified in both the mother and the fetus. The c.488G > A; p.(Arg163His) variant identified affects a conserved amino acid and is absent from the gnomAD controls database []. The variant was therefore classified as pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) variant interpretation guidelines []. The findings for both the mother and the fetus were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. These results were available two days following delivery and verified a heterozygous ALAS2 c.488G > A; p.(Arg163His) and SLC4A1 c.876 + 5G > A mutations in both the baby (Fig. a) and the mother (Fig. b). X-inactivation studies [, ] were undertaken. There was no significantly skewed X-inactivation in the sample provided from the baby.

{"clinical_note": "An 80-year-old Japanese woman presented with a history of TTS complicated by ischemic enteritis (Fig. ). She was previously admitted to our hospital, where she presented with bloody stools due to ischemic enteritis, and was treated with hydration of 1500\u20132500 mL/day and dobutamine. The patient was subsequently discharged without cardioprotective drugs. She was married and had one daughter. She had no family history of cardiovascular disease. She used to cook at a nursing home but she retired. She had smoking history and a drinking habit. She presented to our hospital with upper abdominal pain and bloody stools, 4 months after her first hospital admission for TTS.\nAt the examination, her general condition was good, she was conscious alert, with a temperature of 36.6 \u00b0C. Her height and weight were 148 cm and 42 kg (body mass index 19), respectively. Her blood pressure was 114/80 mmHg, heart rate was 90 bpm, and arterial oxygen saturation on room air was 97%. Her abdominal pain improved upon admission. Her abdomen was flat, soft, tender, and had good gurgling,however, digital rectal examination showed blood on the examining finger, indicating a possible relapse of ischemic enteritis. Physical examination showed a regular cardiac rhythm with normal S1 and S2, no detectable murmurs, and clear lungs. Although the patient did not experience chest pain, her electrocardiogram revealed negative T waves in many leads (I, II, III, aVL, aVF, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6). Blood examination showed that her brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin I levels had risen to 1578 pg/mL (healthy upper limit 18.4 pg/mL) and 357.2 pg/mL (healthy upper limit 15.6 pg/mL), respectively. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels had risen to 26.1 mg/dL (healthy upper limit 20.0 mg/dL) and 0.87 mg/dL (healthy upper limit 0.79 mg/dL), respectively. There were no findings of liver dysfunction. Echocardiography showed wall motion abnormality centered on the left central ventricle, with ballooning of the apical portion. We suspected the recurrence of TTS. We believe that the abdominal pain and dehydration due to ischemic enteritis may have contributed to the development of TTS.\nAs a treatment, we gave the patient a small amount of oxygen (2 L/min). She also received 10,000 units/day of continuous intravenous heparin for 2 days to prevent left ventricular thrombosis, and fluid replacement of 1500 mL/day to treat TTS (Fig. ). Although her body weight increased temporarily, the urine volume was normal, oxygenation was stable, and exacerbation of heart failure was not observed. The BNP level also showed a downward trend; hence, diuretics were not administered and hydration was continued. The BNP level and myocardial wall motion were normalized on the fourth day after admission (Fig. ).\nFor differentiation of ischemic heart disease, a coronary angiography and an acetylcholine provocation test were conducted on the 22nd day after admission. Although no significant stenosis was found in the coronary artery, the acetylcholine provocation test revealed a considerable multivessel coronary spasm in the left coronary artery, suggesting coronary vasospastic angina pectoris associated with TTS, which was treated using \u03b2-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nicorandil. She was discharged on the 22nd day. The negative T-wave on the electrocardiogram normalized on the 60th day after discharge. (Fig. ). She was also treated in gastroenterology and psychiatry, and was prescribed probiotics and anxiolytics. Her ischemic enteritis remained stable without abdominal pain.

{"clinical_note": "A 63-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital with intermittent epigastric abdominal pain for the past three months. Results of the physical examination on admission indicated no icteric sclera. The abdomen was soft with no palpable abdominal mass. The patient had experienced a weight loss of about five kg in the past two months and had no history of hepatitis B or C. She had been exposed to dogs and sheep and denied any history of exposure to infected cases from the epidemic area. After admission, CA19-9 was measured and was 796.20 U/mL. No serological examination for echinococcosis was performed because of the limited conditions of our hospital. Test results from pelvic ultrasound indicated menopausal uterus and uterine fibroids. Test results from gastroscopy showed chronic non atrophic gastritis. Colonoscopy revealed multiple polyps in the large intestine (basically removed); intestinal histopathology (cecum, biopsy) showed severe chronic inflammation of the mucosa and adenomatous hyperplasia of the individual glands. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the upper abdomen (Fig. A) revealed a more homogeneous thickening of the gastric wall in the antrum. Round unenhanced low-density foci with a diameter of 4.6 cm was seen in the S7 segment of the liver. Nodular calcifications were also observed. No significant dilatation was noted in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The size and shape of the gallbladder were normal, the wall was not thick, and no significant abnormal density was observed in the cavity. The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands showed no significant abnormalities. Test results from computed tomography indicated liver cyst and intrahepatic calcifications. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the liver and gallbladder (Fig. B, ) revealed a normal size and shape of the liver and proportion of each lobe, and the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and flow vessels ran naturally. A long T1 and long T2 cystic signal with a diameter of about 4.7 cm was observed in the right lobe of the liver, with liquid level, short T1 high signal intensity in the lower layer, high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging sequence, and enhancement of the cyst wall on the enhanced scan. Test results from magnetic resonance imaging showed that the space-occupying lesion of the right lobe of the liver had been considered to be more likely a hepatic hydatid cyst. Preoperatively, three-dimensional reconstruction demonstrated the location of the tumor and its relationship with the surrounding vessels (Fig. A).\nThe patient underwent laparoscopic S7 segmentectomy. Intraoperative findings showed that the tumor was located at the S7 segment of the liver and was about 5 \u00d7 4 cm in size and partially protruding from the surface of the liver, with an intact capsule and clear boundary with normal liver tissue. The tumor compressed the right hepatic vein and its tributaries and densely adhered to the right hepatic vein (Fig. B). On postoperative pathology, a mass was observed immediately adjacent to the liver capsule, with a volume of 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4.5 cm. The section surface showed a brown turbid fluid, a smooth inner wall, and greyish red, greyish yellow, and soft section surfaces of other liver tissues. The pathological section showed a low-grade mucinous cystic neoplasm (volume 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4.5 cm) in the S7 segment of the liver, with steatosis in the surrounding hepatic tissue area, chronic inflammatory cell infiltration in the portal area, and no tumor cell involvement in the margin of the liver resection.\nImmunohistochemistry demonstrated tumour cells CK7 (+), CK19 (+), and CEA (\u2212); stromal cells ER (+), PR (+), \u03b1-inhibin (a small amount +), vimentin (+), desmin (+), and actin (+) (Fig. A\u2013C).

{"clinical_note": "The patient is a 7-year-old boy born and raised in the Central-West region of Brazil (Cuiab\u00e1) from nonconsanguineous parents. He exhibited odontogenic abscesses associated with unexplained sinusitis at age 4 with resolution of the condition after standard treatment. At the age of 5 years, a low-impact trauma in the right elbow, evolved to a local disproportional inflammation within a few hours, was treated with immobilization with plaster splint. Over the following two weeks, the patient developed fever and persistent, painful edema diagnosed as pyoarthritis in the right elbow. At that time, laboratory analysis revealed mild anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) = 10.0 g/dL), hematocrit (Ht) = 30.5%), high levels of acute reactant markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) = 21 mm, and C-reactive protein (CRP) = 15.3 mg/dL (reference value (RV) < 1 mg/dL)). Also, a computed tomography (CT) of the right elbow revealed the presence of diffuse periosteal reactions affecting the proximal metaphyseal regions of the radius and ulna, as well as of the distal metaphyseal region of the humerus plus voluminous joint effusion and diffuse soft tissue elbow enlargement, especially in the medial aspect. With the diagnostic impression of probable sepsis of the elbow, the patient underwent arthrotomy with surgical drainage of a large amount of purulent fluid with lumps, and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated. After 72 hours of antibiotic therapy and arthrotomy, the patient maintained the marked painful edema in his right elbow and culture of the synovial fluid came out negative. The patient remained hospitalized until the 53rd postoperative day when he presented with sudden and pronounced edema and pain in the left knee after trauma caused by falling from his own height while playing in the corridor of the ward. He underwent to another arthrotomy of the left knee with discharge of abundant purulent liquid. Due to persistent painful edema, the patient underwent another arthrotomy of the left knee for drainage of a joint effusion that was repeatedly purulent, all with negative cultures.\nOf note, a magnetic resonance imaging of the left knee () showed significant inflammatory arthropathy, with joint effusion associated with diffuse synovitis; extension of the inflammatory process into the periarticular soft parts affecting the popliteus and quadriceps muscle; extrusion of the medial meniscus; and small foci of inflammatory edema affecting the subcortical bone marrow of the trochlear sulcus and the medial femoral condyle, which may have corresponded, according to the radiological report, to the focus of incipient osteomyelitis.\nAfter 60th day of hospitalization, the patient was discharged, but two weeks after, there was another need for hospitalization due to another arthritis. At that time, laboratory analysis demonstrated high levels of acute reactants markers, and he never evaluated to sepsis. Another arthrotomy was necessary again with pus drainage.\nBecause of the recalcitrant situation and the suspicion of an inborn error o immunity, a target gene panel (Invitae panel, 407 genes, Jeffrey Modell Foundation Partnership Program) was requested, and an already reported mutation in the PSTPIP1 (c.688 G > A (p. Ala230Thr)) gene was found in the patient and in the mother.\nCuriously, just after genetic founding, the mother discovered similar cases in the family and reported of herself having a prolonged episode of arthritis in the right knee, which began after trauma during a soccer game at the beginning of her adult life. During the reported occasion, she fully recovered, and other members of the family have not yet been genetically investigated. She also reported of having had cystic acne throughout adolescence and young adulthood, with nowadays facial skin marked by scar depression. Finally, genetic sequencing was not just essential for the diagnosis but also for genetic counseling and clarification of the underlying condition. During 2 years of follow-up, no episodes of pyoderma gangrenosum were noted, neither in the mother nor in the index patient.\nAfter being discharged from his last hospital stay, the patient presented at the age of 8 with two more subsequently episodes of left knee arthritis triggered by low-impact local trauma and a new episode of arthritis, this one in the right ankle, due to trauma secondary to the use of inadequate footwear (). In these episodes, the response to treatment with prednisone 1 mg/kg over 3 weeks was satisfactory, followed by gradual withdrawal. However, no specific measure could be accessed to infer the impact of the nonpreventive treatment with anti-IL1, as suggested in the literature. Unfortunately, anti-IL1 blockers are not available, in both public and private systems in Brazil, and that is the reason the patient did not receive it.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

The range of folate was also normal.\nRegarding the low prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in healthy persons, extensive studies have been performed to find out the cause. In order to rule out atrophic gastritis, gastric and duodenal endoscopy and biopsy were performed. The data from the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract were normal. There was no evidence for celiac disease in duodenal biopsy, and serum anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) was within the normal range. Gastrointestinal transit evaluation showed no defect in the mucous membranes of jejunum and ileum. Thus, gastrointestinal disorders were rejected.

A heterogeneous mass was noted in the left kidney. Another polypoidal mass was also seen in the lumen of the urinary bladder, attached to its posterolateral wall.\nContrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) of the abdomen helped in the renal anatomy and characterization of the mass, which revealed L-shaped crossed fused renal ectopia. The right kidney was not present in the right renal fossa and was in the midline, anterior to the aortic bifurcation at the L4-L5 level.

The left kidney was enlarged, with a large soft heterogeneous tissue density mass involving the interpolar and lower pole regions that exhibited heterogeneous enhancement with central non-enhancing areas. Few calcified foci were seen in the mass, along with moderate hydronephrosis. In the delayed phase (15 minutes), no contrast excretion from the left kidney was recorded. The interpolar region of the right kidney was contiguously infiltrated by the left lower pole renal mass. Small tumor thrombi were present in the segmental right renal veins draining the interpolar region.

Marked pleomorphism and mitotic activity were noted, 18-19/10hpf. There was an abrupt transition to well-differentiated nodules of hyaline cartilage. Intervening stroma showed consistent focal areas of myxoid change with chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. The focal osteoid formation was present, with numerous giant cells and apoptotic debris. Areas of chicken-wire calcification and hemorrhage were also identified, along with large necrotic sections ().\nThe tumor cells were immunopositive for CD99 with strong S100 protein expression in the areas of cartilaginous differentiation, immunonegative for pan-cytokeratin, CK7, CK20, p63, desmin, and myogenin, and with retention of INI1 expression ( and ).

The pain was not related to her posture and became more prominent when she moved. She had a medical history of lumbar disc herniation and no history of trauma. On initial evaluation, her vital signs were stable. Apart from the pain of the waist and back, physical examination revealed unremarkable findings. Routine blood tests were obtained. Further, liver function tests revealed normal results. The blood CA199, CA125, CEA, and AFP levels were also within normal limits.\nComputed tomography of the chest revealed scattered pulmonary nodules with calcifications associated with a soft tissue mass measuring 3.3 cm \u00d7 2.4 cm and without pleural thickening at the superior lobe of the right lung () (SOMATOM definition, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany; tube voltage, 100-120 kVp; tube current, 450 mA; slice thickness, 0.625 mm; pitch, 0.992:1; rotation speed: 0.5 s/rot; ASIR-V:30%.). Enlarged lymph nodes of the right hilar were also evident. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT revealed diffuse lesions with massive calcifications in the liver, which shows faint peripheral enhancement in the arterial phase and low enhancement in the portal phase (Iopromide Injection, Bayer Pharma AG; the arterial phase and portal venous phase were obtained at 25 s and 60 s after contrast injection.). The largest lesion measuring 10.2 cm \u00d7 5.9 cm was located in the right lobe of the liver and (). CT examination also revealed osteolytic lesions with a massive thick sclerotic rim in the right second rib, 11th thoracic vertebra, and first lumbar spine. Bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate showed multiple hypermetabolic activities in the involved bones (). Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no anomalies. The patient underwent transthoracic needle biopsy of the largest pulmonary lesion located in the right superior lobe. Histopathological analysis revealed epithelioid cells arranged in a glandular pattern with clear cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for CD31, CD34, CAMTA1, and EMA, but negative for ERG, TFE3, PCK, and desmin, with a Ki-67 index rate of 10%. Histopathological examination indicated a rare low-grade malignant vascular neoplasm, confirming the diagnosis of EHE.\nConsidering the multiple intra-pulmonary, right hilar lymph node, liver, and bone metastases, the patient was treated with chemotherapy with paclitaxel liposome (240 mg/m2; day 1) and carboplatin (550 mg/m2; day 1).

{"clinical_note": "We present a case of a 58-year-old female patient with a large recurrent ventral hernia. Six years before, the patient had been operated on for the umbilical hernia, with the simple repair without a mesh. The patient was an active smoker who suffered from morbid obesity with a body mass index of 43 kg/m2 and COPD as comorbidities relevant for this case report.\nThe patient was introduced to the surgeon during hospitalization at the gastroenterology department where a diagnostic workup due to a clinical picture of chronic small bowel obstruction was conducted. While taking the anamnesis, the patient reported frequent abdominal cramps, swelling, and pain in the area of the hernia that had intensified in the last few weeks. The physical examination revealed a large irreducible ventral hernia in the lower abdomen that was quite painful on palpation, but soft and, at that time, without signs of incarceration or strangulation. Taking into account the clinical picture with threatening hernia incarceration, the surgeon did not opt for preoperative optimization of the patient in terms of smoking cessation and starting a weight loss program but made an indication for semielective surgery.\nOn operative procedure, greater omentum, part of the transverse colon, and a cluster of small bowel loops with signs of chronic obstruction were found as hernial content. After adhesiolysis hernial content was reduced into the abdominal cavity. Hernial defect measuring about 7 cm in diameter and about 15 cm in the vertical line with significant rectus diastase in the supraumbilical part of the abdomen was revealed. Using the Rives-Stoppa technique a wide retromuscular space was created. Lateral dissection boundaries of this space were perforating neurovascular bundles in the area of the lateral edges of the rectus muscle on both sides. The posterior fascia was easily closed using also a portion of the hernia sac to bridge the defect between the posterior rectus sheaths. A 30 \u00d7 25 cm polypropylene mesh was placed in the retromuscular space ensuring adequate mesh overlap over the edges of the hernia defect of a minimum of 5 cm in all directions.\nWhen we observed that the anterior fascia, due to the size of the defect and decreased abdominal wall elasticity, would not close entirely and cover the mesh, we opted for rectus mobilization by the ACS method to avoid bridging. Upon extensive dissection of the anterior abdominal wall subcutaneous space without preservation of the rectus perforator vessels, relaxing incisions of the external oblique muscle aponeurosis were performed. Using the Ramirez technique, long longitudinal incisions of aponeurosis were made bilaterally, adjacently to the semilunar line, extending from the costal arch to the groin. This procedure resulted in the considerable mobilization of the vital musculofascial flap medially, and the hernial defect was closed at the midline without tension. Then, four redon drains were placed, i.e., 2 in the retrorectus space and another 2 in the subcutaneous space.\nThe postoperative course was complicated by skin ischemia. Ischemic lesions of the abdominal wall skin on the right with signs of necrosis along the midline were observed already on day 8 (). On postoperative day 11, multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) of the abdomen was performed because of the ever more abundant wound discharge. MSCT findings showed a large subcutaneous seroma, a normal musculofascial component of the abdominal wall, appropriate mesh position, and normal intra-abdominal status. Percutaneous puncture of seroma was performed and about 800 ml of clear seroma was evacuated. During the next 10 days, ischemia progressed, along with the development of another two full-thickness skin necrotic foci paramedially (). Considering the relatively strict demarcation area of necrosis, we opted for the operative procedure of necrosectomy.\nFollowing abdominal wall necrosectomy with a safety margin of healthy tissue and considering an appropriate amount of vital residual abdominal skin, as well as the absence of signs of local tissue infection or mesh infection, primary wound closure was performed in consultation with a plastic surgeon (). As early as day 4 of the second operation, increased wound discharge and signs of skin wound dehiscence occurred, which required removal of skin sutures (). Then, a wound dressing with a hypertonic solution was applied for a week.\nWhen inflammation subsided, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) with the \u201cRenasis Ez Max VAC\u00ae system\u201d (Smith & Nephew, Mississauga, Canada) was initiated (). NPWT was delivered in continuous mode with negative pressure maintained at \u2212100 mm Hg. Dressing in the form of a sponge of polyurethane black hydrophobic foam was changed every third day. After 2 weeks of NPWT administration, considerable improvement was recorded in wound cleaning and formation of healthy granulation tissue (). NPWT was continued for the next 2 months, which resulted in further improvement of condition of the patient, along with decreased wound discharge and cavity reduction. The wound swab obtained twice during dressing change was sterile. The patient was discharged from the hospital and regular changing of silver-impregnated antimicrobial wound dressing (Aquacel Ag, ConvaTec, Reading, United Kingdom) was continued in ambulatory care that led to complete wound closure in 7 months ().", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows individual\u2019s risk factors for development of condition', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 16-year-old male with DOCK8 deficiency (homozygous for DOCK8 variant NM_203447.3:c.4153+1G>A) enrolled on an IRB-approved National Cancer Institute HSCT trial for patients with DOCK8 (NCT01176006). His disease, diagnosed at age 8 years, manifested with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, chronic molluscum contagiosum, and eczematous dermatitis. Recent complications included diagnosis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) 4 months pre-HSCT. Treatment with rituximab (4 doses) and LMB regimen (, ) (2 cycles), including vincristine, doxorubicin, corticosteroids, methotrexate and with cumulative cyclophosphamide dose of 3300 mg/m2 as per ANHL1131, Group B (R-COPADM), was complicated by chemotherapy-associated grade III BKV-HC managed with cidofovir and 2 infusions of third-party donor-derived quadrivalent anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV), -Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), -adenovirus (ADV), and -BK virus specific T-cells (VSTs) at 5x107 cells/m2 (NCT02532452) (). VSTs were well tolerated without any infusion reaction. HC symptoms subsequently resolved while asymptomatic BK viremia persisted. Achieving a complete remission, he proceeded to HSCT with his father as the haploidentical bone marrow donor. Reduced intensity (RIC) conditioning was comprised of fludarabine 30 mg/m2 x 5 days (days -6 to -2), busulfan dosed with target area under the curve (AUC) of 3600-4000 uM.min/day x 3 days (days -4 to -2), cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg x 2 days (days -6 and -5), and low-dose total body irradiation (TBI, 200 cGy) on day -1. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was comprised of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT/Cy) on days +3 and + 4 along with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) x 30 days and tacrolimus x 6 months, both of which started on day +5 (). Mild cystitis without hematuria developed on HSCT day 0. BK viremia simultaneously increased from 588,844 copies/mL (3 days pre-HSCT) to 6,456,542 copies/mL on day +4 ().\nHis immediate post-HSCT course was complicated by gross hematuria and painful bladder spasms with PT/Cy (50 mg/kg) on days +3 and +4. Grade IV gross hematuria, managed with daily blood product transfusions, persisted alongside worsening acute kidney injury (AKI, day +14) (). Continued transfusion dependence led to significant fluid retention and 11 kg weight gain over 11 days. Daily platelet infusions were used to maintain platelet count \u2265 30 K/mcL, and platelet engraftment \u2265 50 K/mcL was not attained. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved at day +21; chimerism studies demonstrated 100% donor-derived cells without evidence of GVHD.\nProgressive hydronephrosis and hydroureter prompted Foley catheter and bilateral nephrostomy tube placement by day +30. Gross hematuria from the left nephrostomy tube occasioned left renal arteriography which revealed active bleeding unrelated to the nephrostomy at multiple sites and features suggestive of vasculitis. Coil embolization performed on two separate occasions (days +35 and +38) provided only transient stabilization. Ongoing bleeding and transfusion needs were accompanied by increasing total and direct hyperbilirubinemia (2.9 mg/dL and 2.7 mg/dL, respectively (day +43)). Complete left renal artery embolization on day +42, followed by initiation of intravenous cidofovir (), stabilized the patient for transport to receive an additional infusion of third-party VSTs (day +43) produced using the same donor as his second pre-HSCT infusion (NCT02532452). BK viremia measured 5,754,399 copies/mL at third infusion, nearly a full log increase from viral load with pre-transplant VSTs ().\nTwo days after VST infusion (day +45), onset of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was evidenced by fever, hypotension, worsening lung opacities, and bilateral pleural effusions. Inflammatory markers indicative of CRS were also elevated. CRP peaked at 268.7 mg/L on day +43 following VST infusion. Interestingly, CRP had been rising in the days leading up to VST infusion, potentially in the context of significant bleeding and interventional procedures. A rapid rise in ferritin was seen from 4,641 mcg/mL pre-VSTs (day +40) to 5,313 mcg/mL post-infusion (day +45) and 17,456 mcg/mL on day +47 (). Plasma IL-6 rose from 360 pg/mL pre-infusion (day +41) to 2,182 pg/mL on day +45 with CRS onset and prior to initiation of the IL-6R (receptor) blocker tocilizumab (). Concurrent blood, urine, and viral testing remained negative for any signs of new infection. Aggressive fluid resuscitation, bilateral chest tube placement, vasopressor support, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and 4 doses of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) were given over 48 hours. Following fluid resuscitation for CRS, liver studies (day +47) demonstrated worsening hyperbilirubinemia. Liver ultrasound showed hepatosplenomegaly and sluggish flow through the main portal vein, raising concern for late-onset sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS)/veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Given prior life-threatening hemorrhage, defibrotide was contraindicated. Multiorgan failure and worsening coagulopathy led to hypoxic arrest on day +63. Autopsy was declined but limited postmortem single core liver, kidney, and lung biopsies demonstrated hepatic SOS/VOD with zone 3 hemorrhagic necrosis, acute renal tubular injury, and early pulmonary exudative phase diffuse alveolar damage ().

A day after TAVR, echocardiographic-derived mean trans-aortic valve pressure gradient of the patient was 15 mmHg (). Dyspnea was improved, and the patient had good exercise tolerance thereafter. One year later (October 2020), the patient suffered from worsening heart failure with pulmonary edema. ECG of the patient revealed a new-onset Af and the echocardiogram disclosed an increased mean THV pressure gradient to 48 mmHg (), worsening mitral regurgitation (MR), and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Response of the patient to standard heart failure treatment, such as intravenous inotropics and diuretics, was poor. MDCT revealed HALT and RLM (). On the top of the concurrent single antiplatelet medication for CAD of the patient, a NOAC (rivaroxaban) was added for the new-onset Af and leaflet thrombosis. A series of follow-up echocardiograms within 3 months showed a progressive drop in trans-aortic valve pressure gradient to 17 mmHg (), together with reduced MR and PH. MDCT showed resolution of HALT and RLM () 4 months after NOAC treatment. Heart failure symptoms improved gradually but Af persisted.

{"clinical_note": "A 70-year-old man presented shortness of breath in July 2017. He did not report any oncological or autoimmune familial medical history, but had a personal history of type 1 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and arterial hypertension. A thoracoscopy allowed pleural fluid evacuation and the diagnosis of epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma. Frontline chemotherapy by cisplatin-pemetrexed was started and was switched to carboplatin-pemetrexed due to deterioration of renal function (6 cycles). In November 2017, he started vinorelbine due to pleural effusion relapse.\nIn March 2021, as he presented an increase of dyspnea and needed several thoracentesis, CT scan showed a nodular thickening of pleura. The tumor board decided to treat him with nivolumab in 3rd line (240 mg every 2 weeks). After the 1st infusion (March 18, 2021), he presented with grade 2 asthenia, grade 1 vomiting, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a 3-kg weight loss. Two days after the second infusion (March 31, 2021), the patient contacted us for asthenia, vomiting, and grade 3 diarrhea, limiting his quality of life (treated at home by diosmectite, loperamide, and racecadotril). The 3rd infusion was reported by 2 weeks. He was hospitalized just before the 3rd infusion because of watery and foul-smelling diarrhea, without blood, GERD, fluctuating nausea, and vomiting, complicated by dehydration and hypotension. Physical examination revealed a grade 1 sinus tachycardia, a known pleural effusion, and a normal abdomen. Biologically, he had normal plasmatic values of ionogram, TSH, ACTH, and cortisol. The dosage of total immunoglobulins was normal, and the serum protein electrophoresis only showed an inflammatory profile. Stool culture, Clostridium difficile research, and parasitological examination of the stool were negative.\nTo progress toward a diagnosis, we performed endoscopic evaluation. Ileocolonoscopy with ileal and colic biopsies were normal, eliminating Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, or ICI-induced colitis. Esophago-gastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a major duodenitis with erythematous aspect and diffuse superficial ulcerations (). To eliminate infectious enteropathy, we performed intestinal biopsies with normal bacteriological and virological examination. Surprisingly, histological examination revealed elementary lesions of CeD: increased intraepithelial T lymphocytes (IEL) (>30 IEL/100 enterocytes), crypt hyperplasia, marked villous atrophy, and alteration of normal crypt/villous ratio (3:1) (). The CeD was graded type 3b according to the modified Marsh classification of histologic findings in CeD (Oberhuber). Serum IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase were positive (128 U/ml, with a lab norm of 10 U/ml) and anti-endomysial IgA were positive (80 U/ml, with a lab norm of 10 U/ml). Altogether, the endoscopic, histological, and biological results led us to the diagnosis of CeD induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti PD-1 nivolumab).\nHe was initially treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) intravenously 200 mg/day for 48 h and then 120 mg/day (40 mg 3 times a day). He received PPI at 80 mg for 1 month. In the face of persistent diarrhea despite anti-diarrheal medication, methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day was introduced initially intravenously for 3 days, then prednisolone per os at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 2 months, followed by a progressive decrease until 10 mg/day. A test to eliminate adrenal insufficiency was performed, before stopping corticosteroid. A gluten-free diet was also introduced in hospitalization for a long-term perspective. The patient remained in the hospital for 2 weeks and nivolumab was stopped. Ten days after the end of hospitalization, he only had three diarrheas per day.\nTwo months later in the consultation, he mentioned a good clinical improvement and a weight gain with a good adherence of gluten-free diet. A control EGD was realized, finding a complete healing of the inflammatory aspect and of the ulcerations of the duodenum (). Duodenal biopsies showed grade I villus atrophy and mild chronic aspecific gastritis (without atrophy, metaplasia, dysplasia, or Helicobacter pylori). A control EGD is planned 6 months later and a lifelong gluten-free diet is recommended.\nIn an oncological perspective, 7 months after the last nivolumab infusion, the patient still had a stable disease, without requiring any additional line of systemic treatment ().", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'mechanisms, drugs', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}

No pathogen could be detected, and the patient experienced neutropenia from day 10 to day 25 (). However, hemiplegia and hemiconvulsions suddenly occurred on patient's right limb, and computed tomography (CT) scans of patient's brain showed a hyperdense lesion with surrounding edema, which was highly suspected as cerebral infarction in the right parietal lobe and small hypodense areas in the left and right parietal lobes. No obvious abnormality was showed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of patient's brain, but CT scans of the lung showed multiple hyperdense lesions on day 18 (). Febrile neutropenia in patients after chemotherapy with cerebral symptoms may be highly indicative of infections in the brain (, ).\nTreatment was continued VRC and IPI, and changed to teicoplanin (TEC, 400 mg, daily, intravenous injection) as antibacterial and antifungal drugs Treatment was changed to voriconazole (VRC) and imipenem as antifungal and antibacterial methods after a positive result for the test of (1,3)- \u03b2-D-glucan (100.70 pg/mL, Guangzhou Zhaokang Biotechnology Co., Ltd) on day 22. However, the fever was unresponsive and the lesions in the brain and lung were more serious a week later.

Infection with Rhizomucor miehei was also proven by mNGS both in CSF with relative abundance about 0.35% on day 28 and BAL with relative abundance about 28% on day 35 (), and the routine and biochemical examinations of CSF were negative (). After 2 and 3 weeks of antifungal treatment, CT scans showed that lesions were obviously absorbed both in the brain () and the lung (), and PCT and CRP were also recovered following antifungal therapy (). Finally, the patient's general condition improved, and his right limb function partly recovered on day 55.

{"clinical_note": "In January 2021, a 2-year-old boy of white Caucasian origin presented to his local ophthalmologist for acute unilateral sixth nerve palsy and was subsequently transferred to our pediatric emergency department for further evaluation. The patient, generally being fit and well, had developed a sudden dysfunction in lateral movement of his left eye, resulting in a continuous abduction deficit with consecutive fixated turn of the head to the left side. His medical history was unremarkable for trauma, headache, vomiting or fever. He had not received any vaccinations within the last few weeks. Apart from a mild gait instability, there were no concomitant symptoms or other focal neurological deficits on clinical examination. The patient did not suffer from any chronic diseases and did not take any regular medication; his vaccination status was complete according to national recommendations.\nThree weeks prior to onset of symptoms the patient had experienced a respiratory tract infection resulting in an increased respiratory rate, dry cough, intermittent fever and loss of appetite, lasting for 2 weeks. Symptomatic treatment was initiated by his local pediatrician, who attributed the patient's symptoms to a common cold rather than COVID-19. Thus, no oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses was obtained. At the same time, the patient's father and his uncle developed cough, dyspnea, sore throat and muscle aches; the uncle tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR from oropharyngeal swab (). The child's uncle does not live in the same household but had been in close contact to the patient 4 days prior to his positive test for several hours due to an indoor-birthday party. The patient's relatives were unvaccinated as at that time the COVID-19 vaccines were still unavailable for the general public.\nOn admission, laboratory inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein were negative. Full blood count showed mild thrombocytopenia (186 109/) but was unremarkable otherwise. Cranial contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an hypoplastic left abducens nerve and atrophy of the corresponding left lateral rectus muscle compared to the contralateral side (). There were no signs suggesting any inflammatory intracranial process or elevated intracranial pressure, no papilledema. A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure was 24 cmH2O corresponding to the upper limit of normal range () thus diagnostic lumbar puncture was followed by therapeutic drainage of 8 ml CSF. Routine CSF laboratory parameters yielded a normal result; no oligoclonal bands were detected on CSF/serum. Multiplex-PCR (Filmarray, BioFire, Biomerieux Lyon, France) from CSF was negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV), enterovirus, herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, human herpesvirus 6, human parechovirus, varicella zoster virus, Cryptococcus neoformans and gattii, E. coli K1, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitides as well as Streptococcus agalactiae and pneumoniae. An additional multiplex-PCR performed on an oropharyngeal swab sample yielded a negative result for adenovirus, coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43, human metapneumovirus, human rhino-/ enterovirus, influenza virus A and B, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, parainfluenza virus 1\u20134, respiratory syncytial virus, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertusssis, Chlamydophila pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Testing for Borrelia burgdorferi showed no antibodies in neither serum nor CSF. An EEG was unremarkable. Repeated ophthalmologic examinations revealed incomitant squint angles due to left-sided sixth nerve palsy and a significant abduction deficit of the left eye, consistent with the diagnosis of left abducens nerve palsy. An underlying retraction syndrome was considered unlikely due to the sudden onset of symptoms and absent globe retraction. Optic nerve examination was unremarkable.\nReal-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 (oropharyngeal swab sample) was negative on admission, while serology turned out to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG (Euroimmune, Germany). Of particular note in this context, SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG was also detected in CSF. Pathogen-specific antibody index as an indicator for potential intrathecal antibody production was negative, suggesting involvement of central nervous system being secondary to systemic infection rather than direct viral infection (). An rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 from CSF was negative.\nGiven the boy's history of recent respiratory tract infection, COVID-19 very likely in his father and proven in his uncle, and detection of SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies in the patient's serum and CSF, post-infectious abducens nerve palsy appeared to be the most likely diagnosis. During inpatient stay, symptoms already showed spontaneous mild improvement without therapeutic measures. Following discharge, the boy was regularly seen for ophthalmologic follow-ups.

{"clinical_note": "A 42-year-old Chinese man presented to the outpatient clinic of otorhinolaryngology at Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, in September 2018, complaining of right ear discharge accompanied by discomfort for 3 years. The patient had a history of seawater contact in August 2015, including underwater diving near the coast of the Yellow Sea near Qingdao City, Shandong Province. After a couple of days, the patient noticed a small volume of clear drainage from both ears, accompanied by mild discomfort and ear pruritus. As the condition progressed, drainage from the left ear gradually vanished within half a month, whereas the drainage from the right side increased and became a thick, purulent exudate containing debris, eventually turning a dark brown or chocolate color. As the ear canal became almost entirely obstructed by the thick excretion, the patient experienced mild hearing loss, coupled with intermittent tinnitus, and experienced a sensation of ear fullness. Without the use of any medications, he removed debris from the right ear using cotton swabs, resulting in a return to normal hearing and the relief of symptoms. Within a few days, new thick drainage would obstruct the ear canal, and the symptoms would reappear. The patient sought health care twice at local hospitals in Xi\u2019an City from Shaanxi Province; however, the underlying illness remained unidentified and did not improve. The discharge from the right ear gradually reduced and turned from brown to white until March 2018, when a low-concentration hydrogen peroxide solution was used to rinse the right ear canal at a local hospital. During the course of the illness, the patient denied any accompanying symptoms, such as fever, chills, headache, vertigo, diarrhea, or flatulence, and he did not have a history of infectious diseases, diabetes, or any immunocompromising condition. Before the diagnosis, the patient underwent audiometric and otoscopic examinations, in addition to radiological examinations using computed tomography imaging to examine the temporal bone. The exudate was collected from his right ear using a sterile swab and was transferred to the clinical microbiology laboratory for examination.

Laboratory findings revealed elevated serum PTH (188.1 pg/ml, reference range: 15\u201365 pg/ml) and hypercalcemia (total serum calcium: 3.29 mmol/L, reference range: 2.1\u20132.6 mmol/L). Indicators related to thyroid function were within normal limits. Laryngoscopy showed left vocal cord paralysis. Ultrasonography showed that the left thyroid lobe was enlarged significantly, a hypoechoic lesion nearly occupied the whole lobe, and comparable signs were presented on the neck CT (). Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy demonstrated two-phase nuclide accumulation on the left thyroid (). Chest CT showed multiple micro pulmonary nodules ().\nDuring the surgical exploration, we found that the tumor invaded the anterior cervical muscle group and left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Only the superior parathyroid was found in the left neck. En bloc resection (including part of the invaded recurrent laryngeal nerve and muscle tissue and entire thyroid) and left central lymph node dissection were performed to completely remove the affected tissue. The tumor profile showed that the thyroid was markedly infiltrated, and the normal gland was almost invisible (). Postoperative histopathological findings revealed that SaPC widely invaded the ipsilateral thyroid, and 1/6 of the lymph nodes showed metastasis.

Also, on the right side, there was sensory loss in the leg and below the Th8 dermatome. On the left, there was sensory loss below Th10 dermatome and distal loss of temperature sensation.\nPast medical history revealed a cervical trauma which occurred 30 years ago when a glass chip lodged into the left side of the patient's neck. The patient removed the visible glass shard from his neck and did not seek medical attention; therefore no clinical and radiological investigations were carried out. No neurological symptoms followed this incident.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the lumbosacral and thoracic regions showed a mild convexity of the L5-S1 intervertebral disc with no other clinically significant findings (\u201cSiemens SOMATOM Emotion 6\u201d) (images not shown). To further explore the possible causes of the patient's symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the C1\u2013L2 segments was performed (\u201cSiemens MAGNETOM Avanto 1.5 T\u201d). At the level of C4\u2013Th3 the spinal cord was thickened and hyperintense on T2W images, features consistent with myelitis; however there was no appreciable contrast uptake (Figures and ). At the level of C6\u2013C7 an oblong (1.6 x 0.4 cm), T1 and T2 hypointense lesion was found (). Because a foreign body was suspected, CT scan of the C1\u2013Th3 levels was performed and demonstrated a hyperdense lesion occupying the spinal canal and the left intervertebral foramen ().\nCombining the CT and MRI results with the past medical history of an old injury with a glass fragment, it was determined that the lesion represented a glass foreign body in the spinal canal. The patient also had an X-ray of the cervical spine but the foreign body could not be visualized, most likely due to being located at the level of C6-C7, where it was obscured by the surrounding structures ().\nTaking into account the clinical picture, an extensive period of time between the trauma and current presentation, and MR imaging findings, an acute demyelinating episode rather than traumatic spinal cord injury was suspected. Further diagnostic work-up would typically have included a lumbar puncture to identify oligoclonal bands, cells, and protein, but it was contraindicated due to the risk of disturbing the foreign body and causing it to migrate upon a sudden decrease in pressure during puncture. Serum Aquaporin-4-specific antibodies could not be performed at the time and were planned for a later time.\nThe patient fulfilled the inclusion criteria for acute transverse myelitis: bilateral and not necessarily symmetrical sensory, motor, and autonomic spinal cord dysfunction, a clear sensory level, peak of symptoms within 4 hours and 21 days after onset of symptoms, and exclusion of other causes (neoplastic, vascular, and compressive) []. Compressive cause was excluded because the spinal cord pathology seen on MRI extends far from the location of the glass shard, which would be unlikely given the size of the foreign object and its possible effect upon the spinal cord if it migrated within the spinal canal. Thus, because the glass fragment lay dormant for the last 30 years, it was deemed not to be the direct cause of the patients' symptoms.\nTreatment with methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously daily for 6 days was initiated.\nAfter consultation with the neurosurgeons it was decided not to remove the foreign body from the spinal canal, because the risks of surgery would outweigh the benefits. At the time of consultation, the patient was already showing improvement on medical management. Given that the situation was not hyperacute, the symptoms were better explained by the inflammatory and demyelinating reaction within the spinal cord rather than direct contact with the foreign body. Also, it could not be guaranteed that removing the glass shard would result in symptomatic improvement. Upon removal of the foreign body some diffuse bleeding would be expected, which combined with the already inflamed spinal cord parenchyma would likely further compromise the spinal cord, potentially causing vascular complications and myelomalacia, all of which would further decrease the chance of clinical improvement. Risk of general surgical complications (postoperative infection, bleeding, and thromboembolism) further argued against surgical treatment. An absolute indication for surgical treatment would be an infectious complication of the foreign body, which was not present. The patient agreed with the treating physicians that surgery would not be the best option and did not want the operation. If current medical treatment would have proven unsuccessful, and the patient's clinical condition worsened, surgery would have been indicated.\nDuring the course of treatment the patient's condition improved. Sensory loss diminished, and the right leg strength improved to 4/5 on Lovett test, but urinary retention remained. Intermittent catheterization was prescribed.\nThe patient returned for a follow-up visit 10 months later with a stable and improved neurological state. Lower limb strength was 3/5 proximally and 4/5 distally, with positive bilateral Babinski sign. Minimal intermittent urinary retention remained but did not significantly impair the patients' quality of life. The patient resumed his activities of daily living and continues to work as a security guard. Follow-up MRI of the cervical spine shows the same oblong hypointense object and normal spinal cord after the resolution of myelitis (Figures and ).\nFurther follow-up is scheduled every 6 to 12 months, with an outpatient brain MRI to identify any other demyelinating lesions that may be present in case this episode was part of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), or multiple sclerosis (MS).", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

The lesion was diagnosed in the primary care setting as an AK, though possibility of BCC and SCC was considered.\nThe previous BCC had been managed successfully with six weeks of topical imiquimod treatment. Procedural removal of the AK was offered to the patient, but he expressed interest in trying a different approach. The patient was contemporaneously enrolled in a clinical trial examining the use of Kanuka honey on rosacea [] and decided to try using the Kanuka honey topically on his AK.\nHonevo\u00ae medical grade Kanuka honey (90% Kanuka honey, 10% glycerin) was topically applied once daily using a small amount on the fingertip rubbed into the lesion and surrounding 5 mm of normal skin for 10\u201330 seconds.

The patient's postoperative course after retransplant included prolonged hemodialysis (8 weeks) due to acute kidney injury, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, hepatitis E infection, and hepatic artery stenosis in the anastomosis area, treated by angioplasty and stent insertion. Of note, hepatic artery stenosis resulted in ischemic-like cholangiopathy and prolonged cholestasis.\nThe patient's condition stabilized eight months after transplantation. Cyclosporin and Myfortic were administered for immunosuppression, in addition to aspirin and ursodeoxycholic acid. A liver biopsy performed at that period revealed numerous hypertrophic, iron-loaded macrophages and severe bile duct damage and loss, consistent with early mild chronic rejection (). Hemosiderosis was attributed to secondary iron overload, considering the numerous risk factors for this complication presenting before and after the retransplant (multiple blood transfusions, kidney injury, and CMV infection).\nEight months later, elevation of liver enzymes was observed: alanine transaminase (ALT), 127 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST), 61 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase, 209 IU/L, and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT), 222 IU/ L.

{"clinical_note": "A five-year-old male began experiencing a popping sensation followed immediately by the sensation of heat and pressure starting medially at the base of the skull which radiated two centimeters bilaterally. He was a product of a nonconsanguineous union, whose birth history did not involve instrumentation and whose past medical, surgical, and developmental histories were all noncontributory. This sensation was experienced simultaneously with bilateral numbness of the posterior tongue and difficulty in speaking, both of which lasted fifteen seconds with gradual attenuation. The above would occur upon abrupt lateral rotation (either direction) of the head approximately five to ten times a year unrelated to trauma, diminishing in frequency as the patient aged.\nBetween the ages of eleven and fifteen, as a competitive fencer, the patient would experience the same symptomology when performing actions involving extreme, abrupt lateral rotation of the head, translating to a frequency of approximately once to twice weekly.\nAt the age of nineteen, during military training and combat, the same symptomology was experienced approximately fifteen times when abrupt lateral rotation of the head prompted by various forms of minor external head trauma was experienced.

She had been suffering from abdominal pain for about 1 year, and the pain has become more intense in the last 6 months. The pain was postprandial and localized to the right upper abdomen. She has become icteric with generalized spread plus itching since past 2 months. The patient had no history of alcohol consumption or smoking. The patient was referred to us with a highly probable diagnosis of pancreatic head and neck carcinoma to be consulted for surgery. Also, a plastic stent was implanted for her in the previous health center due to intra- and extrahepatic duct dilation for the relief of patient symptoms and signs. After admission to our hospital, she was evaluated by abdominal computed tomography (CT), endosonographic imaging, and diagnostic ampullary biopsy. The abdominal CT scan with contrast exhibited an 18 mm \u00d7 20 mm hypodense mass at the head and neck of the pancreas (). Also, endosonographic imaging was performed to rule out periampullary lesions (). A 20 mm \u00d7 19 mm lesion was seen in the pancreatic head and neck region, and the main pancreatic duct was slightly dilated in the body of the pancreas. Moreover, the common bile duct (CBD) was distally thickened and contained sludge. Subsequently, diagnostic biopsy for pathological assessment was done. The biopsy revealed an irregular gray-creamy soft tissue which had undifferentiated malignant tumor features at microscopic evaluations. During the Whipple procedure, after cutting the neck of the pancreas in the left side of the portal vein, the frozen section revealed more involvement of pancreatic tissue. Although additional 2 cm was resected, the pancreas residue still had tumor involvement, macroscopically. Therefore, the patient was undergone total pancreatectomy.\nPostoperative pathological studies were established and indicated a tumor with the greatest dimension of 4 cm which was extended to the duodenum. Invasion of the venous, lymphatic vessels and perineural sites was seen; however, no exact evidence of distant metastasis was found. The periampullary occlusion had hindered the bile flow over time, leading to chronic cholecystitis and pancreatitis which was confirmed by histopathological assessments. The hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed the presence of two cellular populations including spindle fibroblast-like and pleomorphic cells within the tumor. In addition, the proliferation pattern of the mesenchymal cells was storiform (). There was not any well-differentiated component in the tumor tissue or adjacent tissue. Overall, the pathologic stage II A was assigned to the tumor. The immunohistochemical staining was performed, and the tumor was positive for CD68, lysozyme, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and vimentin (). Also, it was negative for S-100P, cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, desmin, CD34, smooth muscle antigen, MDM2, and CDK4. Therefore, the tumor diagnosis was compatible with UPS. The tumor Ki-67 expression was more than 30%. To evaluate metastasis occurrence, contrast-enhanced thoracic high-resolution CT scan and multidetector CT scan of abdominopelvic were done at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after operation, and no evidence of metastasis was detected.

Gasserian ganglion nerve block was performed to treat the first branch neuralgia of the trigeminal nerve in the right at the point which is 2.5 cm lateral to the right angle of the mouth, following a straight line directed toward the pupil. A needle was inserted under guidance of X-ray imaging on the monitor display. When the tip of the guiding needle reached the foramen ovale, the location of the needle tip was confirmed to be slightly inside from the median in the frontal view. Next, after confirming dysesthesia, 2% xylocaine was injected. And then loss of sensation was confirmed in the V1 and V2 regions. After injecting 99.5% ethanol (0.2 mL), radiofrequency thermocoagulation was added continuously for 180 seconds at 90\u00b0C.\nOn the following day, the patient noticed a sudden visual acuity (VA) decline and hyperemia in the right eye. She visited a neighborhood ophthalmologist and was diagnosed with conjunctival hyperemia, corneal epithelial defect, and Descemet's folds in the right eye. Because no improvement was achieved, she visited our hospital two days later. The initial VA was 0.03 (n.c.) in the right eye. A slit-lamp examination revealed severe conjunctival hyperemia all around the periphery, remarkable corneal superficial neovascularization, especially, at 11 to 5 o'clock, corneal epithelial defects of the size approximately 3 \u00d7 4 mm, Descemet's membrane folds, and mild stromal edema were observed; however, no signs of inflammation were seen in the anterior chamber. The patient did not experience any eye pain and corneal sensitivity measured with Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer was <10 mm in the right eye and 60 mm in the left, showing remarkable decline of corneal sensitivity in the right. She was diagnosed with NK stage 2 ().\nTreatment was started with 0.3% ofloxacin ophthalmic ointment (Tarivid\u00ae ophthalmic ointment 0.3%; Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) twice daily and rebamipide ophthalmic suspension (Mucosta\u00ae ophthalmic suspension unit dose 2%; Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) 4 times daily. The corneal epithelial defects were gradually alleviated at 1 week after ganglion nerve block (Figures and ).\nBecause severe conjunctival hyperemia persisted, we added fluorometholone ophthalmic suspension (fluorometholone\u00ae ophthalmic suspension unit dose 0.1%; Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 3 times daily. At 1 month after ganglion nerve block () severe conjunctival hyperemia, very severe corneal superficial neovascularization at 11 to 5 o'clock, persistent corneal defects with smooth and rolled edges, and stromal swelling in the central cornea occurred. At 2 months (), superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK), conjunctival hyperemia, corneal superficial neovascularization at 11 to 5 o'clock, irregularity of corneal epithelium, stromal scarring in the central cornea, and the right corneal sensation of 10 mm remained. Evaluation with the HRT II RCM was made in April 2017 and no corneal subbasal nerve fibers were observed in the right eye (Figures and ). Five months after the trigeminal nerve block, slight irregularity of corneal epithelium and stromal scarring in the central cornea were observed; however, conjunctival hyperemia and corneal superficial neovascularization were overall improving and the corneal sensation in the right eye also recovered to about 50 mm although SPK remained (). At this point, corneal epithelial defect was overall improving; therefore, ofloxacin eye ointment was stopped. Rebamipide and fluorometholone eye drops were continued and the patient was followed up. According to the patient, she had regained the sense of touch on the cheek. Corneal erosion sometimes recurred but it recovered in about a week. Six months after the trigeminal nerve block, the corneal sensation in the right eye was 60 mm. SPK and conjunctival hyperemia, corneal superficial neovascularization, and corneal stromal edema were all ameliorated (). Therefore, fluorometholone eye drops were tapered off and only rebamipide eye drops were continued. In addition, at this point, regenerated corneal subbasal nerve fibers in the right eye were detected by the HRT II RCM although they appeared to be smaller and thinner than those in the fellow eye (Figures and ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'mechanisms, drugs', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 65-year-old man with no relevant family or personal history was admitted due to a 2-day history of mild dysarthria and naming impairment with difficulty finding words and holding a conversation. Furthermore, his family reported at least one-month history of motor awkwardness and gait instability. During the neurological examination, the patient was well oriented, displayed fluent, coherent spontaneous language, and had mild dysnomia. He had remarkable clinical symptoms of parkinsonism: glabellar reflex was persistent; the patient presented a decreased blinking rate, hypomimia, moderate bradykinesia and hypokinesia in the right limbs, and slow gait with reduced right arm swing (Hoehn & Yahr stage I). The examination revealed no further abnormalities. With the clinical suspicion of parkinsonism, we performed a complete blood test performed at baseline, with either normal or negative. A brain MRI scan revealed increased signal intensity in the left putamen with diffusion restriction, suggesting lacunar infarction (). By the initial findings obtained in the MRI, vascular study was completed with echocardiogram, Holter monitoring, and Doppler ultrasound of the supra-aortic trunks which showed no significant alterations. Parkinsonism was studied using 123I-ioflupane SPECT (DaTSCAN), which revealed asymmetrical tracer uptake in the caudate nuclei (decreased uptake in the left caudate nucleus) and a near-complete lack of activity in the putamina, particularly on the left side (). On discharge, the initial working diagnosis was ischemic stroke and idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The patient remained at home. Progression was poor: dysphasia persisted and mobility decreased dramatically until the patient was unable to walk or even hold a standing position. He was readmitted 2 weeks later in a state of stupor. An emergency EEG revealed short-interval (<2 s) lateralized interictal epileptiform discharges in the left hemisphere (triphasic sharp waves and spikes); discharges were of greater amplitude in anterior regions and occasionally spread to the contralateral hemisphere. Within 24 hours, the patient went into coma (Glasgow Coma Scale 3) and was admitted to the intensive care unit. In the following days, and despite administration of several antiepileptic drugs (levetiracetam, valproate, propofol, and midazolam), he remained comatose and displayed clonic movements in the right arm. An additional brain MRI scan performed a month after the initial scan revealed progression of the lesions, with a patchy, gyriform hyperintensity predominantly affecting the cortex of the left hemisphere and the right temporoparietal cortex, visible in diffusion sequences only ().\nOur patient's rapid neurological deterioration, the presence of myoclonus, and MRI findings pointed to a diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. To rule out other possible causes of rapidly progressive dementia, we conducted a tumour extension study including tumour markers, onconeural antibodies, and a thoracic-abdominal CT scan; the study yielded negative results. The results from a CSF cell count and a biochemical and microbiological analysis were negative; Harrington test for the determination of 14-3-3 protein on CSF was positive (test was performed at Spain's National Microbiology Centre). An additional EEG performed 2 months after the first EEG revealed disorganised slow background activity, with generalized periodic sharp-wave complexes (PSWCs) at a frequency of 1 Hz (). A genetic study found no mutations in the PRNP gene; the study of codon 129 polymorphisms revealed methionine/valine heterozygosity (M129V).

{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 40-year-old primiparous woman. She was diagnosed with submucosal fibroids by her previous gynecologist 5 years prior, based on chief complaints of atypical genital bleeding and hypermenorrhea. She underwent hysteroscopic myomectomy for one 1 cm sized and one 3 cm sized submucosal fibroid located between 2 and 3 o'clock in the uterine fundus. Asherman's syndrome was suspected after the patient exhibited secondary hypomenorrhea 10 months after surgery. Therefore, hysterosalpingography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. Intrauterine adhesions were suspected based on hysterosalpingography findings, while uterine cavity narrowing was identified using MRI. Hysteroscopy revealed filmy adhesions consistent with myomatous tissue at the excision site, and the patient was diagnosed with Asherman's syndrome.\nEight months after diagnosis, the patient underwent hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. The filmy adhesions observed on the left side of the fundus were easily separated with Hegar cervical dilators, and an intrauterine device was inserted after dilation. The patient was diagnosed with stage I Asherman's syndrome defined by European Society for Hysteroscopy classification of intrauterine adhesions, and menstrual flow returned to normal after the operation.\nWhile the patient had a strong desire to bear children, her inability to conceive for 7 years led her to pursue in vitro fertilization (IVF). After having a miscarriage at 7 weeks of gestation, she underwent cervical dilatation and uterine curettage.\nSix months after the miscarriage, the patient became pregnant again through IVF and was referred to our hospital at 7 weeks of gestation. At 19 weeks of gestation, tissues with a free edge were visualized within the amniotic cavity using obstetric ultrasound and were determined to be amniotic sheets on MRI at 31 weeks of gestation (). The course of pregnancy was uneventful thereafter, and an elective cesarean section was performed at 38 weeks and 2 days of gestation because of a breech presentation.\nThe placenta adhered to the uterine wall after childbirth and could not be easily separated manually. The blood vessels on the uterine surface at the placental implantation site were engorged (), leading us to diagnose the patient with placenta increta. The placenta remained firmly adherent to the uterine wall, and although there was almost no bleeding from the uterine cavity, cesarean hysterectomy was performed after informed consent was obtained from the patient. In the abdominal cavity, 4 cm subserosal uterine fibroids were observed on the left side of the fundus, and adhesions thought to be caused by endometriosis were found in the right adnexa, posterior uterus, and anterior rectum. The operative time was 101 minutes, while the total blood loss was 1,584 ml (including amniotic fluid). Blood transfusion was not required. Macroscopic examination of the uterus after extraction showed the presence of placenta from the fundus to the posterior wall, diffusely adherent to the myometrium (), along with partial thinning of the fundus.\nPlacenta increta was confirmed based on postpartum histological findings of placental villi invading the myometrium, without an interposed decidual plate.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged in good health on the 7th postpartum day.", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 45-year-old Hispanic male who had end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. His HLA typing was A 2,- B 7, 35, Cw 4, 7, DR 4,- DQ 8,-. His donor was a 46-year-old Hispanic female with history of hyperlipidemia with a measured 24-hour urine creatinine clearance of 151 ml/min. Her HLA typing was A 2,31, B 35,44, Cw 4,5, DR 4,-, DQ 7,8. The patient had been on intermittent hemodialysis for two years prior to undergoing living related kidney transplant. Induction therapy consisted of basiliximab and solumedrol. Maintenance therapy was with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. His two-year course after transplant had been unremarkable, with a baseline serum creatinine of 1.5\u20131.7 mg/dL (134\u2013150 \u03bcmol/L), without proteinuria or hematuria.\nTwo years after transplant he presented to the renal transplant clinic with complaints of lower extremity edema that had appeared over the previous three days. He stated he had experienced a flu-like illness a week prior. In addition, he admitted to inadvertently taking tacrolimus 1 mg q12h, rather than his prescribed dose of 3 mg twice a day for almost one month. He had corrected the dose approximately 3 weeks prior to presentation. On examination, he was normotensive and afebrile. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were normal. He had periorbital edema and 6 mm pitting edema in lower extremities. He did not have graft tenderness or bruit.\nLaboratory data was remarkable for creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL (194 \u03bcmol/L). Urinalysis showed moderate blood and 3+ protein (previously no proteinuria), urinary sediment of more than 50 red blood cells (RBCs), 11\u201320 white blood cells (WBCs) per high power field (HPF), and urine protein/creatinine ratio of 8.2 g (previously 100 mg). Tacrolimus trough was 4.9 ng/mL.\nDue to acute kidney injury, proteinuria, and hematuria in the setting of suboptimal immunosuppression, there was a high concern for acute rejection versus rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis perhaps due to recurrence of the unknown primary disease. Renal ultrasound and a renal biopsy were ordered. Given the risk of acute rejection due to inadvertent medication noncompliance, prednisone was increased from 10 mg daily to 50 mg daily, tacrolimus was increased from 3 mg twice a day to 5 mg twice a day, and mycophenolate mofetil was increased to 1500 mg twice a day. Of note, BK virus and donor specific antibodies were negative a month prior.\nThe renal US was negative for hydronephrosis or calculi. Three days later, a biopsy was performed.\nPreliminary biopsy report was consistent with postinfectious glomerulonephritis (). Due to the recent infection, anti-streptolysin O (ASO) antibodies, C3, and C4 were ordered. Since initial biopsy did not have any glomeruli for immunofluorescence (IF), he was scheduled for repeat biopsy.\nIn the interim, C3 and C4 were reported. C3 was low at 59 mg/dL with a normal C4 at 35 mg/dL (). Tacrolimus trough was 8.6 ng/mL.\nSecond kidney biopsy one week later revealed minimal residual subendothelial electron dense deposits, but no evidence of large subepithelial electron dense deposits (). IF showed nonspecific patchy staining with C3 in glomeruli and some tubules. All other reagents were negative, including C4d in peritubular capillaries, BK, and SV40 in tubular cells. There is no evidence of cell-mediated or antibody mediated glomerulonephritis. Overall, biopsy was consistent with resolving postinfectious glomerulonephritis. Anti-streptolysin O (ASO) was elevated at 603 IU/mL (), highly indicative of Streptococcus being the causative agent.\nGiven that his AKI did not appear to be due to rejection, tacrolimus was decreased back to his basal dose of 3 mg twice a day and prednisone was tapered to 10 mg daily. Fluid management was achieved with furosemide. He was not prescribed any antibiotics. A month later, creatinine had decreased to 1.9 mg/dL (168 \u03bcmol/L), and in a 3-month period, it had returned to baseline and proteinuria and hematuria had completely resolved ( and ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 2-year-old healthy boy underwent an office-based surgical circumcision by his physician. During the procedure, profound bleeding was observed that was not controlled by applying direct pressure. The physician attempted to control the bleeding by multiple deep suturing; the bleeding was stopped successfully and the patient was discharged home. During the postoperative period, the child had progressive painful and difficult voiding with only few drops of urine after straining. During this period the child was prescribed painkillers for his discomfort and no additional evaluation was done. After about a week he was referred to a district hospital with fever (temperature=38.1C), agitation, vomiting, urinary retention, and significant abdominal distension. Abdominal examination showed decreased bowel sounds, dull percussion, and severe guarding. Urgent abdominopelvic ultrasound revealed large volume of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, with small amount of urine in the bladder. The initial lab tests also showed leukocytosis with left shift and increased blood creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Catheterization with a 6-Fr feeding tube failed because it did not pass beyond the subcoronal urethra. The patient underwent emergency midline laparotomy with the diagnosis of acute abdomen and the fluid was drained. A small intraperitoneal bladder rupture was noticed at the dome of bladder. The gastrointestinal tract was inspected precisely and was intact. The diagnosis of intraperitoneal bladder rupture with urinary ascites was made probably due to near-total urethral obstruction. The rupture site was repaired in two layers and a suprapubic cystostomy catheter was fixed.\nTwo months later, the patient was referred to our center for further evaluation and treatment. Antegrade voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed via the suprapubic catheter that showed terminal urethral obstruction (). Urethroscopy was attempted under general anesthesia that failed due to complete obstruction at 1 cm from the meatus.\nDecision was made to explore the area and to repair the urethra. Through a circumferential incision, distal urethra was elevated from the corpus spongiosum. A 3-Fr ureteric catheter also did not pass the obstructed part (). A 5-mm fibrotic tissue was encountered at the site of obstruction (). The corpus spongiosum was dissected free from the corpora cavernosa to prevent iatrogenic chordee after end-to-end urethral anastomosis. The obstructed fibrotic part of urethra was completely resected and an end-to-end urethral anastomosis was performed along with spongioplasty over an 8-Fr silicon catheter in two layers; dartos pedicled flap was used to cover the site of anastomosis. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged home with suprapubic and urethral catheter. The urethral catheter was removed seven days following the surgery. The suprapubic catheter was removed four weeks after the surgery following normal urethral voiding and normal ultrasound. A VCUG was performed six weeks after the surgery that showed normal bladder and urethra with acceptable voiding per urethra (). During a 2.5-year follow-up period, the patient was asymptomatic with normal renal function, ultrasound, and voiding pattern.

His condition subsequently worsened despite treatment with ribavirin. Finally, he died on 26 May after receiving an initial diagnosis of viral encephalitis of unknown cause (Fig. ). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed an opening pressure of 60 drops/min, transparent and limpid fluid, a glucose level of 4.7 mmol/L, and a protein level of 265 mg/L. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a slightly decreased density in the bilateral temporal lobes. Tests for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis yielded negative results. Earlier, the donor had frequent contact with domestic dogs but no longer had this type of exposure since moving to live with his grandmother in another city. His family members denied either exposure to potentially rabid animals or history of rabies vaccinations. His kidneys and corneas were donated for transplantation.\nDonor 2 was an 11-year-old girl who lived in Hebei province in China. Her initial symptoms were nausea, chills and vomiting on 22 Sep 2016. One day later, her condition worsened, and she suffered from fever, disorder of consciousness, coma, respiratory failure and decreased blood pressure, followed by insipidus and myasthenia gravis on 5 Oct. She died on 11 Oct after an initial diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Fig. ). The results of CSF analysis were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed diffuse signal abnormalities throughout the brain and cervical spinal cord. Tests for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, coxsackie virus, herpes simplex virus, adenovirus and rubella virus yielded negative results. Her family members denied exposure to potentially rabid animals or history of rabies vaccinations.

The allograft recovered successfully, and the immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus, mycophenolate sodium and prednisone. The patient initially became symptomatic on 10 Jul 2015 (Fig. ). MRI revealed mottled signal abnormalities around the bilateral ventricles and deep white matter (low or equal signal on T1WI and high signal on T2WI and Flair), which indicated white matter demyelination. He was clinically diagnosed with rabies on 24 Jul according to the typical symptoms; this diagnosis was confirmed 4 days later by detectable rabies virus-specific nucleic acids in saliva, urine, and sputum samples.

{"clinical_note": "A 51-year-old man was admitted to the Department of Nephrology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China) in June 2016 because of hypercalcemia and renal failure. The patient was well until he developed persistent leg and low back pain 20 days before admission. Prior testing at a local hospital showed progressive abnormal renal function (serum creatinine, 304.2 \u03bcmol/L), a high serum calcium level (4.86 mmol/L), and an extremely high level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) (1551 ng/L; reference level, 12\u201388 ng/L). After hydration with saline and diuresis with loop diuretics and hemodialysis, the patient was transferred to our hospital. He had no unusual issues with the exception of a 1-year history of stage 3 chronic kidney disease.\nOn admission, the patient reported fatigue, bone pain, and polyuria. A physical examination on admission revealed blood pressure of 119/80 mmHg and heart rate of 71 beats per min, but no specific findings of the lymph nodes, head, neck, heart, lung, abdomen, or joints. Laboratory testing revealed corrected serum calcium of 3.39 mmol/L, phosphorus of 0.84 mmol/L, PTH of 540 ng/mL, serum creatinine of 151 \u03bcmol/L (after hemodialysis), and hemoglobin of 120 g/L. Urine calcium was 9.2 mmol/24 h. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed complete right bundle branch block and a precordial abnormal ST segment and normal corrected QT (QTc) interval (Fig. ). Myocardial marker analysis showed serum myoglobin of 31 \u03bcg/L and high-sensitivity troponin T of 826 ng/L. Ultrasonography revealed a nodule at the left lower pole of the parathyroid gland. Single-photon emission computed tomography results indicated an adenoma of the left lower pole of the parathyroid gland. Due to no family history of such disease and no medication history of thiazide or lithium, a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism caused by a parathyroid adenoma was made. Because of the high level of troponin T and changes to the ST segment on an ECG, acute myocardium injury was considered, thus parathyroidectomy was deferred for multidisciplinary consultation. The final diagnoses were hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid adenoma, acute renal injury, chronic kidney disease, and acute myocardium injury.\nHydration with 3000 mL of fluid [60% saline (0.9%) and 40% dextrose (5%)] per day, furosemide at 40 mg three times per day, cinacalcet at 25 mg per day, and RRT were utilized to reduce serum calcium levels. Double lumen catheterization of the right femoral vein was used for vascular access. Slow extended dialysis with low-calcium dialysate (1.25 mmol) at bedside was started using a commercially available continuous RRT device (multiFiltrate, Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany). The dialysate flow was 4800 mL/h for 8 h each session. Changes in serum corrected calcium levels are shown in Fig. . Due to an unsatisfactory lowering of serum calcium and preparation for parathyroidectomy, slow extended dialysis was switched to 8-h RCA-predilutional hemofiltration at a replacement rate of 4300 mL/h. The replacement solution was prepared by a local pharmacy (Na, 105 mmol/L; bicarbonate, 21.5 mmol/L; zero calcium; magnesium, 0.5 mmol/L; and glucose, 6.7 mmol/L). The infusion rate of 4% trisodium citrate (citrate dose 4.2 mmol/L) was 220 mL/h and the blood flow was 120 mL/min when hematocrit was 32%.\nGiven the time limit of treatment, we gradually reduced the rate of calcium supplementation from 5.6 to 2.2 mmol/h in the first session of RCA-hemofiltration (Fig. ). The post-filter ionized calcium was 0.34\u20130.53 mmol/L during RCA-hemofiltration. The corrected serum calcium level decreased from 3.5 to 3.2 mmol/L and ionized calcium decreased from 1.97 to 1.67 mmol/L. This result was not inspiring, despite estimated 30 mmol calcium loss during RCA-hemofiltration.\nA lower infusion rate of calcium (1.1 mmol/h) was started at the second session of RCA-hemofiltration (Fig. ). However, chest discomfort and palpitations were reported by the patient after treatment for 15 min. At that time, his blood pressure was 110/64 mmHg and heart rate was 125 beats per min. Blood gas analysis showed potassium of 3.8 mmol/L and a rapid serum ionized calcium decrease (from 1.91 mmol/L to 1.71 mmol/L). Hence, calcium supplementation immediately increased to 5.6 mmol/h and 2 min later, the chest discomfort and palpitation disappeared. However, the 12-lead ECG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with a prolonged QTc interval as compared to baseline at 3 days before (Fig. and Table ). One hour later, the calcium infusion was gradually reduced to 2.2 mmol/h to reduce the level of serum calcium without inducing sinus tachycardia. The ionized calcium decreased from 1.91 to 1.61 mmol/L with unaltered corrected serum calcium.\nThe third RCA-hemofiltration session began at a calcium infusion rate of 2.2 mmol/h, which resulted in a decrease in corrected serum calcium from 3.5 to 2.7 mmol/L and in ionized calcium from 1.91 to 1.18 mmol/L without arrhythmia (Fig. ).\nAfter the third RCA-hemofiltration session, high-sensitivity troponin T decreased to 89.8 ng/L and the patient was deemed sufficiently stable to undergo parathyroidectomy. An untypical parathyroid adenoma was pathologically confirmed. Postoperatively, PTH dropped to 16.9 ng/L and serum calcium dropped to 2.25 mmol/L. Serum calcium was 2.11 mmol/L and serum creatinine was 173 \u03bcmol/L at discharge. The patient received a telephone follow-up at 2 months after discharge and reported serum calcium of 2.13 mmol/L and serum creatinine of 112 \u03bcmol/L without calcium supplementation.", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 42 year old male presented to his primary care physician with a 20 pound unintentional weight loss over a 3 month period and new left axillary lymphadenopathy. A core biopsy of his axillary mass revealed metastatic malignant melanoma. He had no prior history of a primary melanoma. A staging PET/CT revealed abnormal FDG uptake in his left axilla and small bowel. A left axillary lymph node dissection was performed and revealed 2 of 19 lymph nodes involved with metastatic melanoma, BRAF wild type, the largest of which measured 10.1 cm. His medical history was significant for oligodendroglioma, which was surgically resected eight years prior to presentation, followed by radiation therapy for recurrence five years prior to presentation. He received four doses of systemic ipilimumab for his metastatic melanoma without incident. Post-treatment imaging revealed disease progression with new diffuse subcutaneous, lung, liver and bilateral axillary lymph node metastases.\nHe subsequently enrolled on a genetically engineered T-cell trial, targeting tyrosinase. He received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide as a conditioning regimen, then his engineered T-cells were infused, followed by one week of low dose IL-2, (72,000 U/kg IV q8 hours). Per the treatment protocol, unfractionated creatinine kinase (CK) levels were obtained just prior to and for two weeks after infusion of the genetically engineered T-cells. The CK levels were within normal limits during the course of this treatment. He initially experienced disease response, however, four months after his T-cell therapy, he again developed diffuse progression with new hilar lymphadenopathy and progression of his lung and axillary lymph node metastases.\nHe was next treated with three doses of pembrolizumab but post-treatment imaging again revealed disease progression in his lungs. CK levels were not checked during treatment with either ipilumumab or pembrolizumab. Despite multiple lines of therapy, the patient continued to have an excellent performance status, so he thus proceeded to treatment with HD IL-2 (600,000 IU/kg IV over 15 min every 8 h day 1\u20135 and day 15\u201319), which began nine months after receiving his engineered T-cell infusion.\nDuring cycle one of course 1 (day 1\u20135) of HD IL2, he received 10 out of 14 possible doses and experienced the expected adverse effects of hypotension, sinus tachycardia, oliguria, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury. Serum CK was monitored per protocol and was initially normal but peaked at 641 (50\u2013320 IU/L) during the fourth day of treatment without associated symptoms or cardiac findings on EKG.\nHe had an uncomplicated recovery and was re-admitted to the hospital for cycle 2 of course 1 (day 15\u201319) of HD IL-2, without complaints and a normal serum CK level of 133 (50\u2013320 IU/L). After 6 doses of HD-IL2, he began to experience diffuse myalgias and rigors. He was noted to have a rapid rise in CK to 2700 and increase in his serum creatinine from 2.5 to 4.4 (0.6\u20131.4 mg/dL). An EKG revealed sinus tachycardia and his serum troponin level was normal at 0.02 (0.00\u20130.04 ng/mL). The rise in CK was attributed to rigors and he was continued on therapy. He went on to receive 2 additional doses of HD IL-2. When his CK rose further to 3900 and the myalgias became more severe despite resolution of his rigors, subsequent doses were held.\nFurther investigation revealed an elevated serum aldolase of 32.7 (1.2\u20137.6 U/L), and elevated urine myoglobin of 132 (< 28 mcg/L). MB fractionation of CK was not performed. Urinalysis demonstrated large blood without red blood cells. Serial EKGs demonstrated sinus tachycardia but not sequelae of hyperkalemia, such as peaked T waves. Other labs for serologic autoimmunity, e.g. anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA anti-striated muscle antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were not checked. Muscle function was not assessed with electromyography (EMG). He received supportive care and aggressive intravenous hydration with normal saline. He recovered fully from this episode of rhabdomyolysis.\nSubsequent staging with a PET/CT revealed a mixed response in his pulmonary nodules with mild improvement in his hilar and axillary lymphadenopathy. Given his full recovery from previous toxicity and the mixed response on imaging, the decision was made to proceed with a second course of HD-IL2 therapy with close monitoring of CK levels and a low threshold for discontinuation of therapy.\nHe received only two doses of HD IL-2 and again developed diffuse myalgias with a rapid rise in his serum CK level from 184 to 1680. Serum aldolase and urine myoglobin were again significantly elevated, at 16.2 and 3430, respectively. All further doses of HD IL-2 were held and he was again supported with aggressive intravenous hydration. His clinical symptoms resolved and his CK level trended down to the normal range.\nDue to this unusual toxicity, a muscle biopsy was performed to further evaluate for rhabdomyolysis and to ascertain if his engineered T-cells were present in his muscle tissue. The biopsy revealed rare myofiber necrosis and myophagocytosis and scant endomysial infiltrate. The infiltrate consisted of a mixture of CD3 and CD4 positive T-lymphocytes, CD68 positive macrophages and lesser numbers of CD8 positive T-lymphocytes, suggestive of an immune-mediated toxicity causing necrotizing myopathy (Fig. ). It was difficult to ascertain if the T-lymphocyte present represented his engineered T-cells. Of note, the engineered T-cells remained detectable in the circulation at this time. He was discharged home and follow up PET/CT imaging revealed a near complete response. At the time of this follow up, he was found to have new onset vitiligo involving his neck, upper back, chest, and upper arms (Fig. ). A skin biopsy at the edge of his neck vitiligo again revealed CD3+ T-cell infiltration (Fig. ).\nNo further HD-IL2 therapy has been administered and he continues to experience a durable response on imaging nearly two and a half years since completion of his HD IL-2 therapy. Of note, CK levels had not been checked when the patient had received prior therapy with ipilumumab or pembrolizumab. CK levels were, however, monitored at the time of treatment with engineered T-cells and were noted to be within the reference range.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}

He complained of left-sided chest pain and productive cough in the 2 months before admission. He reported no risk factors for HIV infection, occasional alcohol consumption, and was a current smoker with a 30-pack/year smoking history. Initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 77/56 mmHg; heart rate, 106/min; body temperature, 36.1 \u00b0C (97.0 \u00b0F). There was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of the oral cavity revealed poor dentition and inadequate hygiene. Jugular venous pressure was elevated to the angle of the jaw at 45\u00b0 and did not change with respirations. The breath sounds attenuated at both sides, and dullness was present at the base of the bilateral lung. Cardiovascular examination revealed regular rhythm, tachycardia, and distant heart sounds. Laboratory test values were as follows: white blood cells, 29,950/mm3 with a left shift; hemoglobin, 10.6 g/dl; platelets, 453,000/mm3; random serum glucose, 125 mg/dl (normal, 75\u2013115 mg/dl); serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 260 U/l (normal,119\u2013229 U/l); serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST and ALT), 80 U/l and 24 U/l (normal, 0\u201335 U/l); serum albumin, 3.1 g/dl (normal, 4\u20135 g/dl); serum C-reactive protein (CRP), 17.25 mg/dl (normal, < 0.2 mg/dl). The chest radiograph (Fig. ) revealed a mass in the left upper lung, bilateral pleural effusions and cardiac enlargement. The chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a wedge-shaped and pleural-based mass in the left upper lobe (LUL), a thick-walled cavitary lesion containing only water density in the left lower lobe (LLL), bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion (Fig. ). An electrocardiogram was normal. The patient received acute pericardiocentesis and pericardial drainage tube placement, which yielded approximately 800 ml of dark yellow fluid and restored blood pressure. Thoracentesis on both sides was performed and revealed yellow and turbid pleural fluid. Gram stain and cytologic examination of both pericardial and pleural fluid showed no organisms and also malignant cells. Examination of sputum showed no pathogen on staining. Two sets of blood culture specimens drawn at the time of admission did not yield any organisms. The patient was initially diagnosed with a bacterial pericarditis and lung abscess in the LLL. Intravenous ceftriaxone was started as an empirical antimicrobial treatment.\nAfter the admission, the patient continued to be afebrile and his respiratory and cardiovascular status was stable. On day 6, there was minimal pericardial fluid in the drainage tube so the drain was removed. In the morning of day 9, a fever of 39.0 \u00b0C (102.2 \u00b0F) and sinus tachycardia (150/min) occurred. The tachycardia continued for 4 h, and he experienced atrial fibrillation (Af). Immediately after the onset of Af, a cardiac arrest with asystole occurred. He underwent an immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which restored sinus rhythm and blood pressure. Chest CT scan obtained on the same day revealed the remaining thick-walled cavitary lesion in the LLL and the reduced pericardial effusion. After the cardiopulmonary state was stabilized, he underwent ultrasound-guided pneumocentesis of the cavitary lesion in the LLL and 35 ml of purulent fluid was obtained (Fig. ). Gram stain of the fluid revealed Gram-positive filamentous rods, and cultures of the fluid grew Actinomyces species (Fig. ). We analyzed the fluid using a method for clone library sequencing of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene and Actinomyces meyeri along with other anaerobes (Fusobacterium species) were detected []. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchial washings of the mass lesion in both the LUL and LLL were performed. The biopsy revealed non-specific inflammation and organization of the lung tissue with no bacteria. On day 11, antibiotics were changed to intravenous penicillin, and his condition continued to be stable. After 4 weeks of intravenous penicillin therapy, antibiotics were switched to oral doxycycline therapy and he was discharged. Echocardiogram before the discharge showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or constrictive physiology. The patient completed the total six-month antibiotic therapy. At follow up, 6 months after discharge, the patient was gaining weight, felt well, and his CT images had continued to show improvement (Fig. ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "Nivolumab was initiated to treat a 56-year-old woman, with unresectable NSCLC who initially received an adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 4 cycles of cisplatin-pemetrexed.

Figure summarizes the key clinical and immunological data of the index case as well as the timeline of immune checkpoint analysis.\nNo sign of SLR was detectable before the treatment with nivolumab (Fig. and ). A partial response was observed after 5 infusions of nivolumab as suggested by CT scan (Fig. and ). Skin lesions appeared after 5 nivolumab infusions (Fig. ), then mediastinal nodes size started to increase and a micronodular interstitial syndrome was observed (Fig. and ) after 20 nivolumab infusions. Biopsies showed epithelioid cells and Langhans multinucleated giant cells without necrosis, microorganisms or refringent bodies, compatible with sarcoid-like inflammation (Fig. ). Tumor cells, alcohol-acid resistant bacilli and fungus or parasite were not detected (data not shown). Nivolumab was then discontinued. According to RECIST criteria, the patient had a partial response at this time.\nMediastinoscopy revealed sarcoid lesions. Mediastinal nodes sizes (Fig. ) and skin lesions were decreased 155 days later (data not shown), while the interstitial syndrome had deteriorated (Fig. ). Bronchoalveolar lavage showed hypercellularity comprising 41% of lymphocytes without pathogens or cancer cells (data not shown). 348 days later, CT scan showed normal mediastinal nodes and regression of the interstitial syndrome (Fig. ).\nThe expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 was analyzed on PBMC at various time-points after stopping nivolumab (defined as day 0). An important increase of PD-L1 expression was observed on B and T cells at d56 with a peak at d147, compared to other patients treated with nivolumab without relevant immune related reactions (Fig. ). An elevated expression of PD-L1 was observed on monocytes at d147 (Fig. ). PD-L1 expression by PBMC of the index case returned to basal levels at d251 (Fig. ). If we hypothesize that the increase of PD-L1 expression was consecutive to a rebound effect after stopping the treatment, we would have observed a similar increase in patients treated with nivolumab that did not exhibit immune related events. Moreover, expression of PD-1 on T cells was punctually undetectable at d147 at a time when PD-L1 expression was maximal (Fig. ). No marked change of PD-L2 expression was observed. Intriguingly, the increased PD-L1 expression was evidenced only from day 56 to day 147 after nivolumab arrest (Fig. ). This observation suggests that an elevated expression of PD-L1 consecutive to blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction can be associated with sarcoid-like reaction (SLR).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'mechanisms, drugs', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

She had suffered with recurrent urinary tract infections for most of her childhood and adult life but was otherwise well with no other major co-morbidities or risk factors for colorectal malignancy and had no family history of colorectal disease.\nColonoscopy revealed two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon in close proximity to each other and adjacent to a diverticulum-like structure (Fig. ). Each polyp was approximately 3 cm in size and both exhibited a type IV pit pattern with areas of irregularity suggestive of focally advanced disease. Histological examination confirmed both polyps were adenomas comprising both low and high grade dysplasia, without submucosal invasion (Fig. ). On closer inspection the mucosa around the diverticulum was also atypical but not adenomatous. The remainder of the colonoscopy was unremarkable with no other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps elsewhere.\nEndoscopic resection was considered as a therapeutic option however in view of the above characteristics as well as difficult endoscopic access surgery was preferred. Furthermore, radiological imaging had initially raised the possibility of invasive disease in view of sigmoid thickening. The patient underwent high anterior resection and an open approach was chosen because of suspected intra-abdominal adhesions following extensive pelvic surgery. An end colostomy was formed at the patient\u2019s pre-operative request. At laparotomy the right fallopian tube was adherent to the sigmoid colon and adjacent to this a blind ending tube was noted to emerge from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon. This was marked for pathological identification.\nOur patient went on to have an uneventful recovery and her quality of life following surgery was good.

There was no consult done. One month prior to her admission, she noted electric-like sensation on her nape, which was worsened by neck movement. The weakness eventually progressed to the left lower extremity causing difficulty in ambulation. The patient eventually became quadriparetic and needed to be assisted in all activities of daily living. She also developed dysphonia, dysphagia, difficulty of breathing and projectile vomiting that prompted consult to our institution.\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable upon admission. There were no spinal deformities noted. The sphincter tone was lax. Higher cortical function was normal. On cranial nerve examination, there was weak gag and shoulder shrug bilaterally. Manual motor testing revealed 2\u20133/5 on both upper extremities and left lower extremity and strength of 4/5 on the right lower extremity. Hypesthesia was also described at the C4 dermatomal level and dissociated sensory loss was also noted. The patient was hyper-reflexic on both the upper and lower extremities along with bilateral extensor toe sign. The patient's neck was paratonic.\nInitial work-up included a cranio-spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealing a long expansile contrast-enhancing mass involving the entire spinal cord, from the level of the cervical region to the conus medullaris with extension to the lower medulla oblongata (A\u2013D). The patient was started on dexamethasone, which provided minimal relief of symptoms. She was also referred to the neurosurgery service. The patient was advised surgery, however, on the 20th hospital day, the patient's symptoms progressed to quadriplegia and respiratory failure. She subsequently developed healthcare-associated pneumonia succumbing to septicemia.\nOn autopsy, all lobes of the lungs were consolidated secondary to pneumonia (A & B). There was swelling of the entire spinal cord with white to yellow mucoid material coming out from the central canal (C). Cut sections showed that the entire spinal cord and caudal medullary region were replaced by mucoid material (D). The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Histopathologic examination of the spinal cord revealed a cellular tumor arranged around the central canal of the cord. The cells are generally small, with round to slightly ovoid nuclei. The chromatin materials are generally vesicular with occasional clumping seen. Fibrillary processes were noted in the cytoplasm (E & F). Immunohistochemical studies were done. S100 showed staining of the cytoplasmic globules with weak staining of intact cytoplasms. GFAP, synaptophysin, \u03ba, \u03bb and leucocyte common antigen had negative results. Further genetic characterization of the tumor such as IDH, 1p/19q codeletion, MGMT, EGFR and TP53 mutations was not done because of its unavailability in the institution but its histologic and immunochemical features are consistent with holocord oligodendroglioma.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

{"clinical_note": "A 65-year-old healthy Japanese woman presented with a chief complaint of malaise and hematochezia. The physical examination revealed a 10-cm-diameter hard mass at the right lower quadrant of the abdomen without tenderness or cutaneous involvement. Laboratory findings demonstrated severe anemia and elevated tumor markers (hemoglobin, 2.9 mg/dl; carcinoembryonic antigen, 10.8 ng/ml; carbohydrate antigen 19-9, 21.6 U/ml). A colonoscopy showed a circumferential neoplastic lesion at the ascending colon which did not allow the scope to pass through (Fig. a). The biopsy reported a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (Fig. b). RAS mutation was not detected. A CT showed an 8.6-cm-diameter tumor at the ascending colon which seemed to infiltrate the abdominal wall, small intestine, and retroperitoneum (Fig. a). Regional lymphadenopathies and ascites were also observed, but apparent distant metastases were not. Based on these findings, we made a clinical diagnosis of locally advanced ascending colon cancer stages T4b, N2a, M0, and IIIC according to the TNM classification []. Considering the possible extensive invasion to the surrounding structures, we recommended initial neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical resection of the tumor.\nThe patient underwent 4 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 with panitumumab, and the tumor shrank only slightly to 6.9 cm in diameter (Fig. b). An additional 4 cycles of the same regimen were administered but the tumor actually enlarged to 10 cm in diameter (Fig. c), and thus, the disease was determined to be a progressive disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors []. At this point, we felt more chemotherapies and/or surgeries were not recommended because of the evidence of disease progression and because the patient\u2019s condition was quite frail. Instead, we recommended radiotherapy of 60 Gy in 30 fractions (Fig. ). The patient tolerated the treatments well, and no serious adverse effects were reported. After the radiotherapy, the tumor shrank to 6.6 cm in diameter with intratumor liquefactive degeneration (Fig. d). One month after the radiotherapy, she underwent right hemicolectomy with D3 lymphadenectomy. Metastatic lesions of the liver or peritoneum were not observed. The right ovarian vessels and ileum at 10 cm proximal from the ileocecal valve were infiltrated by the tumor and resected concomitantly. The adjacent abdominal wall was intact. The transverse colon and ileum at 30 cm proximal from the ileocecal valve were cut and anastomosed. The macroscopic exam of the resected specimen showed a 9.0 \u00d7 7.0-cm circumferential tumor with a 4.5 \u00d7 3.5-cm ulcer at the ascending colon, which extensively penetrated the colon serosa and infiltrated the ileum and the ovarian vessels (Fig. a). Histopathologically, the primary tumor of the ascending colon and enlarged regional lymph nodes consisted in its totality of granuloma-like or fibrous tissues and no residual cancer cells were found (Fig. b). Pathological findings revealed complete response, and the final findings were ypT0, ypN0 (0/15), and ypStage0.

{"clinical_note": "A 62-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C was referred by his physician to our hospital for surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Imaging findings on enhanced computed tomography (CT) and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed two tumors located in segments 5 and 8, respectively (Figs. and ). Although the alpha-fetoprotein level was within the reference range, the serum level of prothrombin induced by the absence of vitamin K or antagonist-II was high (530 mAU/ml). After a preoperative evaluation based on a three-dimensional (3D) imaging study, anterior segmentectomy was performed. Each branch of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and biliary duct for the anterior segment were ligated together as the Glissonean bundle (so-called, fully simultaneous transection of the Glissonean pedicle [FSTG]) (Fig. ). Perihilar FSTG involved a transfixation suture by using an absorbable thread. The tumor in segment 8 was in contact with the middle hepatic vein. However, this tumor was well-encapsulated, and the tumor and vein were easily dissectable. The patient\u2019s postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 14.\nThree months later, dynamic MRI was performed to check for intrahepatic recurrence, and no imaging findings of recurrence were observed. However, an arterioportal fistula and portal vein aneurysm were incidentally detected (Fig. ). Layers of old and subacute hematomas were clearly observed, and these layers surrounded the aneurysm. Surprisingly, the patient did not have subtle symptoms and showed no episodes of pain, ascites, liver dysfunction, or other abnormalities. We suspected a pseudoaneurysm at that time. Although a perfect angiographic evaluation could not be ensured, IVR was needed to avoid sudden rupture and possible death. Therefore, we decided to attempt IVR after evaluation of the vessels on dynamic CT, and transcatheter arterial embolization was proposed thereafter.\nFirst, angiography via the celiac artery was performed. Arteriography was subsequently used to create a portogram via this APF, and portography clearly revealed hepatofugal flow of the portal vein. Portography also showed that the stump of the anterior portal vein had developed a portal vein aneurysm (PVA) with a diameter of 40 mm (Fig. a). Selective catheterization of the common hepatic artery was then performed. This arteriography clearly demonstrated a fistula between the hepatic artery and portal vein (i.e., APF) at the stump of the anterior branches (Fig. b). Based on these angiography findings, we definitively diagnosed PVA due to an APF, not a pseudoaneurysm.\nNext, an adequate length of APF to perform embolic therapy was confirmed to avoid any occlusion and disturbance at the bifurcation of the right hepatic artery (Fig. b). Selective embolization of the anterior hepatic artery was then accomplished by placing several titanium coils in the whole length of the stump of the anterior hepatic artery. Finally, the flow of blood through the APF was drastically reduced (Fig. c). Arteriography via the superior mesenteric artery showed a remarkable restoration of portal venous flow, and hepatopetal portal flow was clearly observed (Fig. d).\nComplete closure of the APF could be estimated by additional expansion of the metallic coils over time after IVR. Dynamic CT and 3D images 3 days after embolization clearly demonstrated perfect interruption of the APF and disappearance of the PVA (Fig. ).\nImaging studies and serum biomarkers showed no evidence of recurrence. At the time of this study, the patient was good in health and had been reintegrated into society.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}

This is suggested by the presence of gastric contents in his respiratory tract as a result of vomiting. Therefore, this case may be considered death resulting from a mixed causes of myocardium lesions with 4-CMC and amphetamine intoxication, as the concentrations determined in his blood (394 and 2200 ng/mL, respectively) are relatively high, and the detected concentration of amphetamine can be fatal to a nonaddict [].", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'mechanisms, drugs', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}

In his past medical history, there was an unclear history of sensory or motor impairment after coccyx cyst surgery.\nAll laboratory data were within normal limits except for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (521st, 1 132nd) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) > 2 mg/l. Echocardiographic findings were left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% and mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Coronary artery CT-angiography was performed and stenosis of three coronary arteries was established.\nThe induction of anaesthesia was performed with Dormicum 5 mg, Propofol 150 mg, Esmeron 60 mg and Sevoflurane.

He was moved to the cardiac surgery department. During this first postoperative day, the patient was stable, awake and oriented. No signs of haemodynamic instability or cardiac dysrhythmias were seen.\nThe second day after CABG, the overall condition of the patient was good but he had difficulty moving his lower limbs. Neurological consultation was done and the cranial nerves were found to be intact, cerebellar tests and sensory examinations were normal, muscle strength of the lower limbs was 3/5 and symmetric and plantar reflexes were double flexor.\nOn the third postoperative day, the overall condition of the patient was good but he still had difficulty moving the lower limbs. Progressive paraparesis developed and the muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) began to decrease gradually. Paraparesis progressed and muscle strength decreased from 4/5 to 3/5 and then to 2/5. In the evening, severe weakness of the lower and upper limbs developed, absence of DTRs, no plantar reflexes, and muscle strength was 1/5 on the left and 0/5 on the right side.

The pain was tearing in character, radiating to the back and lumbar regions, non-positional and associated with shortness of breath and headache. 50 hours\u2019 duration. The pain was tearing in character, radiating to the back and lumbar regions, non-positional and associated with shortness of breath and headache.\nThe electrocardiogram (ECG), done three hours after the onset of pain, showed sinus rhythm and non-specific repolarisation changes (flattened or inverted T waves in leads I, aVL and V3\u2013V6). Although ECG changes were suggestive of left ventricular strain, the presence of chest pain and a mildly raised troponin level (0.11 \u03bcg/ml) favoured myocardial infarction, and the patient was started on low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at a therapeutic dose, aspirin and nitrates.\nPersistence of the pain after initial therapy prompted referral to our centre. On examination, he was anxious, dyspnoeic (NYHA functional class III with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/ min) and diaphoretic. His temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, heart rate was 79 beats/min, and blood pressure was 187/73 mmHg in the right arm and 145/56 mmHg in the left arm. Physical examination showed a systolic murmur (grade 3/6) in the aortic area, which radiated to the left carotid, but there were no signs of heart failure. The neurological examination was unremarkable.\nChest X-ray () showed enlargement of the mediastinum with cuffing of the aortic knob. The ECG () at our unit showed a normal sinus rhythm, normal QRS axis with sub-epicardial ischaemia in the inferior and apico-lateral leads. Echocardiography () showed a dilated left atrium, good left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction 72%), and severe aortic insufficiency with dilatation of the aortic root and ascending aorta (44 mm).\nContrast-enhanced CT (CECT) angiogram of the thorax () showed dissection of the aorta from the ascending aorta to the iliac arteries, including the coeliac trunk and left renal artery, and causing splenic infarction. Doppler ultrasound of the carotid arteries did not show extension to the carotid arteries. These observations led to a working diagnosis of Standford type A acute aortic dissection. shows biological investigations done at presentation and throughout hospitalisation.\nThe patient was placed on high-flow oxygen at 5 l/min, nicardipine in an electric syringe titrated to a maximum of 10 mg/h, bisoprolol 5 mg/12 h, analgesics and compressive stockings. The LMWH was stopped. On day five of hospitalisation, he developed superficial thrombophlebitis on the left forearm (along the peripheral intravenous line). By day six of hospitalisation, blood pressure and heart rate targets (< 120/80 mmHg and < 60 beats/min, respectively) were achieved.\nOn day 10 of hospitalisation, the patient developed a temperature of 39.1\u00b0C and sudden dyspnoea at rest. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 119 beats/min, blood pressure of 124/76 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 98%. Chest examination revealed crepitation in both lung bases, more marked on the right. We decided on a presumptive diagnosis of severe pneumonia. A repeat chest X-ray () showed bilateral interstitial heterogeneous opacities.\nThe C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 310.43 mg/l with leucocytosis of 17.7 \u00d7 106 cells/l (). Blood samples were collected for culture, and antibiotics (amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid 1 g eight hourly and clarithromycin 1 000 mg 12 hourly) were introduced. Blood culture results (which returned after the patient\u2019s demise) were positive for Klebsiella pneumonia.

{"clinical_note": "An 18-year-old female was admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital in November 2016 with the chief complaints of abnormal limb movements and slurred speech for two years, which worsened 20 days ago. Initially, her movements were slower, her hands were clumsy, and she could not speak clearly. In the past 20 days, she gradually developed dysdipsia, unsteady gait, dyskinesia, significantly increased involuntary movements of limbs and fell > 4 times. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormal signals in bilateral basal ganglia and thalamus. Electroencephalography (EEG) demonstrated diffused 4\u20136 Hz theta waves. Slit-lamp examination showed Kayser\u2013Fleischer (KF) ring in both eyes. Her serum ceruloplasmin concentration was 0.033 g/L (Normal range: 0.2\u20130.6). The symptoms progressively worsened, and she had a fever, with temperature between 37.5 and 38.0 \u00b0C, without chills, cough or diarrhea. The patient had difficulty in opening her mouth, could only speak one word at a time, and had occasional torsion spasm at the time of admission.\nThe patient had xerostomia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, frequent oral ulcers, with no significant weight loss. There was no history of other diseases, but her mother recalled that she talked less, had behavioral changes, abnormal gait, involuntary smile and involuntary movements of all limbs since five years. The parents and older sister did not have similar symptoms. Physical examination revealed that the patient had normal comprehension, with low-grade fever, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, dystonia, lack of coordination, slight tremor, dysarthria, dysphagia and right side Babinski sign positive.\nAfter admission, routine tests revealed decreased white blood cell count of 2.87*109/L (Normal range: 4\u201310). Liver function test showed slightly elevated transaminase level and normal bilirubin level. Albumin level was decreased to 32 g/L (Normal range: > 35). Renal parameters were marginally elevated with proteinuria (1.12 g/24 h) and hematuria (++). Lumbar puncture showed elevated intracranial pressure, normal white blood cell count of 2/ul, elevated protein of 0.69 g/L and elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) of 58.8 mg/L (Normal range: 0\u201340). Anti-AQP-4 (Anti-aquaporin 4) IgG and myelin basic protein were negative. MRI revealed symmetric abnormal signals with low signal in T1-weighted image, and high signals in T2-weighted and FLAIR images of bilateral basal ganglia thalamus, midbrain, and pons (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed diffused lesions in the liver, uneven density, and hepatosplenomegaly. The patient, her parents and her sister underwent genotype test for WD, which showed that the patient had a compound heterozygous mutation, while her family members did not.\nOther laboratory findings included elevated ESR, C-reactive protein, IgG, IgM and hypocomplementemia. The titers of antinuclear antibody (ANA) (S1:640), anti-SSA antibody (+++) and anti-rRNP antibody (+++) were remarkably increased, while anticardiolipin antibodies (ACL), Lupus anticoagulants (LA), and anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein-1 (anti-\u03b22GP1) antibodies were all positive. Stomatological and ophthalmological evaluations provided objective evidence of salivary gland (salivary flow rate and parotid sialography) and ocular (Schirmer\u2019s test and ocular dye score) involvement. Salivary gland biopsy showed typical histopathology of Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed normal arteries, and ultrasound examinations of arteries and veins of bilateral legs, bilateral subclavian, supra-mesenteric, inferior-mesenteric, bilateral renal found no thrombotic evidence.\nBased on all the findings, the final diagnosis for this patient was WD, SLE, secondary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome with anti-phospholipid (aPL) antibodies. Therefore, we started therapy with iv sodium dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS), full dose zinc sulfate for WD, and methylprednisolone (80 mg iv for 7 days, then 40 mg po for 3 weeks), and hydroxychloroquine po for SLE, respectively. Since has three kinds of aPL antibodies were positive, the patient was also treated with anticoagulant therapy (low molecular weight heparin, and then aspirin po). One month later, her neurological symptoms and laboratory tests showed improvement. WBC count, liver function test including transaminase level, bilirubin level and serum albumin level, urine test, ESR, CRP, IgG and complement levels were all normal. Repeat lumbar puncture showed normal parameters. The titer of ANA had declined (S1:160), and aPL (ACL, LA, anti-\u03b22GP1) antibodies were negative. The steroid dosage was gradually tapered and the patient was given oral dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA), zinc sulfate, hydroxychloroquine and aspirin for maintenance.\nThe patient was followed-up every three months at the outpatient clinic. Six months after discharge, her symptoms recurred, and she developed hyponatremia, hematuria and proteinuria, when the steroid was reduced to 2 mg/day. Hence, methylprednisolone dosage was increased to 16 mg/day, while the other treatment remained unchanged.

{"clinical_note": "A 30-year-old gravida 2 para 0 presented at 31 + 3 weeks gestation with sudden onset, unprovoked, epigastric and left sided pleuritic chest pain. This was associated with nausea, vomiting and shortness of breath. Her bowels had opened that day and she was passing flatus. She denied any uterine tightenings, urinary symptoms or vaginal loss and reported normal foetal movements.\nThe patient was an otherwise well South Asian woman with good social supports and no significant medical, surgical or family history. She did however, have a similar presentation at 13 weeks gestation and was diagnosed with left lower lobe pneumonia and a possible empyema on chest x-ray. (Fig. ) Bronchoscopy and washings at this time were negative and she was managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics. Her pregnancy then progressed uneventfully.\nOn presentation, her observations were unremarkable with oxygen saturations at 100% on room air, a respiratory rate of 20 and a normal cardiotocograph (CTG). She was, however, in significant distress secondary to pain, despite opiate analgesia. Respiratory examination revealed decreased breath sounds on the left hand side and abdominal palpation showed left upper quadrant and epigastric tenderness with normal bowel sounds and no signs of peritonism. Routine biochemical investigations including a full blood count, biochemistry and lactate were unremarkable. A chest x-ray, however, revealed evidence of a raised or ruptured left hemi-diaphragm with bowel visible in the chest. (Fig. ) A subsequent CT chest confirmed the diagnosis of a large left diaphragmatic defect with stomach, small and large bowel, and spleen in the chest cavity. (Fig. ) There was no evidence of a gastric volvulus or bowel ischemia. On retrospective review of her previous chest x-ray at 13 weeks gestation, what was originally presumed to be an empyema likely represented a small diaphragmatic hernia. (Fig. ) On further questioning, the patient reported that she was asymptomatic prior to pregnancy and had no prior chest or abdominal imaging for comparison.\nThe patient received a course of steroids for foetal lung maturation and was transferred to our tertiary centre for consideration of urgent delivery and repair of the diaphragmatic defect. On arrival, the patient was found to be haemodynamically stable and her pain was now better controlled with regular doses of opiate analgesia. Given no immediate evidence of bowel obstruction, visceral ischaemia, respiratory compromise or concerns for foetal wellbeing were present, a decision was made, jointly by the surgical and obstetric teams, to conservatively manage the patient. Delivery and repair were planned ideally for after 34 weeks gestation, or in the event of maternal or foetal deterioration. Due to her inability to tolerate sufficient oral intake, a nasogastric tube was inserted and the patient commenced on nasogastric feeds on day five of admission with dietician input. In order to meet nutritional requirements of pregnancy, feeds were titrated from 10 ml/hr. with the aim to achieve 60 ml/hr. However, the patient was unable to tolerate the required feed volume, experiencing nausea, pain and increased nasogastric aspirates. Due to the inability to meet nutritional requirements and the possibility of a partial intestinal obstruction, a decision was subsequently made for an earlier delivery at 32 + 3 weeks gestation.\nWe performed a lower uterine segment caesarean section followed by a left thoracotomy on day 7 of admission. The caesarean section was uncomplicated and a liveborn female infant weighing 1731 g was delivered. The thoracotomy identified a likely Bochdalek hernia involving stomach, small bowel, colon, appendix, spleen and omentum. The contents were reduced and the defect was repaired with four figure of eight Prolene sutures. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged on day nine post-operatively. The neonate was admitted to the special care nursery due to issues of prematurity, specifically, mild respiratory distress, difficulty establishing feeds and jaundice.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 69-year-old man with no history of urinary abnormalities or renal dysfunction. When he was 68, he underwent his first health checkup in several years and was found to have occult blood in his urine, proteinuria, and renal dysfunction. Urinalysis at the first examination showed urine protein of 0.49 g/gCr, urine red blood cells of 30\u201349/high-power field, and pathological granular casts, for which we decided to perform further studies including a renal biopsy. The patient had a history of untreated dyslipidemia. His family history was unremarkable. The patient was not taking any regular medication at the time of the first examination. Physical findings at the first examination were unremarkable. His blood pressure was normal (112/66 mmHg). There was no edema, lymph node involvement, splenomegaly, purpura, or bone pain. Table shows the results of urinary and blood analyses on admission for the purposes of the renal biopsy (dipstick test for occult blood 2+, urine protein 2+, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 0.30 g/g on a spot measurement). The number of dysmorphic red blood cells was 20\u201329 per high-power field. There were no abnormalities in complete blood count or the blood coagulation system. Serum urea nitrogen was 14.9 mg/dL, serum creatinine was 1.19 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine was 47.6 mL/min/1.73 m2. Serum cystatin C level was 1.73 mg/L and estimated glomerular filtration rate by cystatin was 37.1 mL/min/1.73 m2. Immunoglobulin levels were normal. Autoantibodies were negative. Serum and urine monoclonal immunoglobulin (immunofixation electrophoresis) were positive. The serum levels of the IgG \u03ba and \u03bb chains were 31.40 mg/dL and 33.60 mg/dL, respectively. The \u03ba/\u03bb ratio was 0.935. Serum cryoglobulin was negative.\nWith light microscopy, 54 glomeruli were observed, and two glomeruli showed global sclerosis. The remaining glomeruli were enlarged and showed lobular accentuation. In addition to mesangial cell proliferation, all glomeruli showed prominent endocapillary hypercellularity (Fig. \u2013). Neutrophils and eosinophils showed marked infiltration. There was no hyaline thrombus, crescent formation, and double contour of the capillary walls. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was mild. Direct fast scarlet staining was negative. Immunofluorescence was positive for C3 (1+) and C1q (2+) along the glomerular capillaries. However immunoglobulin G (IgG) was negative. The clone we used to originally test for IgG was produced by Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Lot No. 104AG; Aich, Japan). All immunoglobulins were negative (Fig. ). Electron microscopy revealed marked endocapillary hypercellularity. There was infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes, occluding glomerular capillary lumens. In the subendothelial space, there were many tubular structures in parallel arrays. With higher magnification, the microtubules had a hollow core and the diameter was approximately 40 nm (Fig. ). Most of the deposits contained microtubular structures.\nBased on the characteristic electron microscopy findings, ITG was suspected; however, negative staining for immunoglobulins was an unusual finding for ITG. IgG detection by paraffin-immunofluorescence following pronase pretreatment was strongly positive within the capillary spaces of a glomerulus (Fig. ). Immunofluorescence examination of frozen sections using a different clone of anti-IgG antibody (55,144; MP Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan) showed positive staining in capillary walls. Immunofluorescence for C4d was positive along glomerular capillaries (Fig. ). Collectively, the patient was diagnosed with ITG with false-negative IgG staining.\nAdditional laboratory data revealed that serum and urine were positive for monoclonal immunoglobulins.

{"clinical_note": "A 32-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with appetite loss. He had a history of traumatic transverse cervical spinal cord injury at the C5 level due to suicide attempt at the age of 18. As a result of cervical spinal cord injury, he was paralyzed in the lower body. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a late-onset traumatic diaphragmatic hernia with strangulated ileum (Fig. ). The small intestine, transverse colon, and omentum were displaced into the left thoracic cavity, and some portions of these organs showed a decrease in blood flow. Left lung collapse and a compressed right lung with mediastinal shift were evident. The patient underwent emergency surgery. After replacing the incarcerated organs to their original positions, scattered areas of necrosis were identified in the small intestine, transverse colon, and omentum (Fig. ). By using interrupted sutures with non-absorbable 1\u20130 monofilament, the diaphragmatic orifice was closed. Wedge resection with primary closure was performed for the colonic necrosis in two places. Partial resection, 45 cm long, with end-to-end anastomosis was performed for the small intestine. The necrotic omentum was removed (Fig. ). In addition, a gastrostomy tube was placed since delayed initiation of oral intake was expected. The patient developed severe septic shock postoperatively. Treatment-resistant critical hypotension with non-compensatory tachycardia developed, likely due to parasympathetic nervous system damage related to the cervical spinal cord injury. On postoperative days (POD) 3 and 6, cardiac arrest occurred. Fortunately, he was rescued by cardiopulmonary resuscitation with administration of large doses of vasopressin and catecholamine. However, peripheral vasoconstriction, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and ischemia of the gastrointestinal tract developed, which resulted in colonic anastomotic leakage with diffuse peritonitis, abdominal wound dehiscence, and collapse of gastrostomy on POD 6 (Fig. ). The patient was unable to undergo surgical repair because of his poor general condition with continuing severe septic and neurogenic shock. Therefore, he underwent AVS through the open abdominal wound and it was the first procedure at the intensive care unit. The procedure of AVS was as follows: 1. the open wound and peritoneal cavity were rinsed with normal saline and necrotic and/or contaminated tissues were debrided (Fig. ); 2. wound dressing materials (DUOACTIVE\u00ae ConvaTec, New Jersey, USA) for protecting healthy skin around the open wound were patched along the abdominal wound in piecemeal fashion so as to adjust dressing materials to the complicated shape of the wound (Fig. ); 3. two drainage tubes with multiple side holes, up to 30 cm from the tip, were placed in the abdominal cavity through the open abdomen and the enteric contents were suctioned through the drainage tubes using a Continuous Suction Unit MERA Sacuum (Senko Medical Instrument Manufacturing CO, Tokyo, Japan) set to 50\u201375 mmHg continuous negative pressure; and 4) the entire wound was filled with saline-moistened gauzes and covered with polyurethane drape (Fig. ). The colonic anastomotic leakage showed gradual healing over the course of 2 months, followed by contraction and closure of wound dehiscence (Fig. ). Because the gastric fistula remained, a gastrostomy balloon catheter was placed through the gastric fistula. The patient resumed oral intake on POD 112 and left the hospital on POD 190 with the gastrostomy balloon catheter and without incisional hernia.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A three-year-old girl was referred to the Reference Centre of Rare Diseases in Paris. Her medical history was noncontributory. According to her mother, she complained with pain while eating, moderate sensitivity during tooth brushing and above all poor aesthetic aspect of her teeth. Intraoral examination revealed a hypoplastic AIH with yellow teeth and rough surfaces (Fig. ). Brown extrinsic discoloration was seen in the hypoplastic area. Enamel was reduced in thickness and severely hypoplastic, giving the idea of a false microdontia with multiple diastemas. Molars were the most affected teeth showing reduced crown height. In addition, anterior open bite was noted without thumb sucking. Treatment was planned following 3 objectives at this age:Pain prevention and treatment Protection of dental tissue integrity in order to maintain occlusal function and limit dental biofilm retention Restoration of smile aesthetics.\nOn primary molars, the choice of treatment was stainless steel crowns (3 M\u2122 ESPE\u2122) because the occlusal morphology was lost (Fig. ). This way, vertical dimension was slightly increased and maintained. The incisors and canines were isolated with a rubber dam and direct dental composite restorations were placed (Herculite, Kerr [, ] with ER2 adhesives Optibond SL). Teeth were not prepared; we etched with 35% Phosphatidic acid for 30 s, rinsed for 30 s with air and water. Then teeth were air dried, adhesive was applied with an applicator tip, excesses were removed with air before polymerization for 45 s. Affected enamel was not removed but bonding was directly applied to it. As enamel surface appeared rough, a flow composite (Tetric Evoflow, Ivoclar) was applied and served as intermediate material. Its higher fluidity and wettability would allow penetrating enamel roughness (Fig. ). Because tooth morphology of anterior teeth was not severely altered, \u201cOdus\u201d molds were not useful to offer a correct restoration. Composite resins were applied in one layer. Finishing and polishing were achieved with abrasive discs (Sof-lex/3 M ESPE). Patient follow-ups were done 6 months and 1 year after treatment.

Nanohybrid indirect composite (Premise Indirect System, Kerr) was used with dentin and enamel shades mimicking the clinical shade (A3 shade was used cervically, A2 in the core and A1 in the incisal edge). Each layer was polymerised. Rigorous polishing was done in order to obtain shiny surfaces (Tool kit, Kulzer). The restoration was bonded using dual cured composite resin (Variolink Esthetic, Ivoclar\u2122 Vivadent\u2122) taking care to separate each proximal contact with metal matrix. Carefully polishing was made especially at the gingival border with a Touati bur. The patient was very satisfied with the aesthetic appearance. She did not report any trouble with mastication. She was followed every 6 months. Oral hygiene and integrity of the restoration were scrupulously monitored.

On slit-lamp examination, both anterior chambers showed clear aqueous humor and no inflammatory reaction. Dilated fundus examination revealed a subretinal whitish mass and adjacent subretinal hemorrhage. OCT confirmed the presence of a subretinal lesion and intraretinal edema. After obtaining informed consent, the patient was monthly treated with intravitreal administration of 0.5 mg ranibizumab for three months, without any complication and with complete retinal hemorrhage and edema resolution and increased visual acuity of left eye (10/10). Thereafter, the patient underwent routine follow-up visits, on a 2-month basis, including fundus examination and OCT which did not document any abnormal finding. In May 2014, a reduction of visual acuity (from 10/10 to 7/10) was registered. The patient was periodically followed-up but not treated with anti-VEGF drugs as there was no sign of neovascularization. In May 2015, visual acuity further reduced to 3/10 and both fundus examination and OCT revealed a reactivation of the neovascular membrane, edema and pigment epithelial detachment. For this reason, the patient was again treated with intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (0.5 mg), firstly on a monthly basis and thereafter using treat and extend approach, with overall six injections till the end of February 2016, when visual acuity increased to 6/10.

He underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with seven cycles of capecitabine-oxaliplatin, followed by long-course chemoradiation. This course consisted of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) at an outside center, 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the pelvis with a subsequent pelvic cone down of 5.4 Gy in three fractions and an additional 3.6 Gy in two fractions to the gross rectal tumor, given concurrently with capecitabine and trastuzumab. He subsequently underwent laparoscopic-assisted low anterior resection with colorectal pelvic anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy. Pathology from this revealed ypT4N1b rectal adenocarcinoma with lymphovascular invasion. Throughout this period, his liver lesions were successfully treated with several courses of microwave ablation and chemoembolization. Restaging positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan five months later demonstrated a new single site of FDG-avidity within a 1.1 cm left pelvic sidewall lymph node with no other sites of disease. He was referred for curative intent radiation therapy to this lymph node to treat his only active site of disease.\nThis patient had already exceeded the ideal dose constraints for bowel tolerance utilized by our institution and as outlined in RTOG 0822 and RTOG 0529 [,]. Specifically, his prior radiation treatment included a maximum point dose to the small bowel of 54 Gy, with V (50 Gy) of 16 cc, V (45 Gy) of 105 cc, V (40 Gy) of 198 cc, and V (35 Gy) of 329 cc; the latter two volumes are nearly double the ideal volume receiving 35 and 40 Gy. Large bowel had also exceeded ideal constraints, with V (45 Gy) of 41 cc. However, in the context of this young patient with oligorecurrent disease, we aimed to offer this patient curative-intent treatment.\nThe patient was thus treated with MR-guided SBRT, 35 Gy in five fractions delivered every other day to the left pelvic sidewall lymph node plus a 3 mm planning target volume expansion (Figure , panel A). Cumulative EQD2 (using \u03b1/\u03b2 = 3) maximum point dose to the small and large bowel was 71.5 and 84.5 Gy, respectively.\nThe location of the recurrence in relation to the prior irradiated field is demonstrated in Figure .\nThe simulation and daily setup pre-treatment MRI scans were obtained on the ViewRay system (ViewRay, Inc., Oakwood Village, OH) incorporating a 0.35 T MRI. The same imaging protocol using a True Fast Imaging with Steady State Free Precession (TRUFI) sequence was performed to acquire the 3D MRI images with 1.5 mm thickness and a field of view of 50 x 45 x 43 cm without contrast injection. The total acquisition time was 172 seconds.\nAfter image acquisition each day, a physician assessed the target and relation to surrounding anatomy. In the case of movement of critical structures close to the target, the physician had the option to create an adaptive plan that minimized the dose to critical structures. In this case, no adaptive planning was required as the position of the bowel relative to the target did not move significantly. Treatment was delivered using IMRT on the ViewRay system with three Cobalt-60 sources spaced at 120 degrees apart. During treatment delivery, cine MRI imaging at a rate of four frames per second was performed through a sagittal plane to track the intra-fractional motion of the target.\nThe patient experienced no acute toxicity. One month after completion of SBRT, the patient underwent a successful ileostomy reversal, with excellent progression toward return of normal bowel function. Repeat MRI at two months post-SBRT demonstrated no evidence of disease.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 67-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for an evaluation of worsening right upper abdominal tenderness associated with episodes of nausea and vomiting for the last month. She described the pain as mild to moderate, continuous, radiating to the back, unrelated to eating, and without alleviating or exacerbating factors. She denied fevers, jaundice, or issues with bowel movements and urination. She admitted to a 10 kg weight loss over the last two months. Her medical history was significant for sinus tachycardia with good medical control on metoprolol. She admitted smoking and drinking on social occasions. Her family history was unrevealing.\nAt initial evaluation, her vital signs were within normal limits with a body temperature of 98\u00b0F, a pulse rate of 61 beats per minute, a respiratory frequency of 12 breaths per minute, and a blood pressure of 130/85. The abdominal exam revealed a palpable, poorly defined, mildly to moderately tender tumor-like firmness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) without rebound tenderness. The remainder of her physical examination was unremarkable. The laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.2\u00d7109/L, hemoglobin 135 g/L, glucose 6.1 mmol/L, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) 9 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) 18 U/L, total bilirubin 6.8 mmol/L (direct bilirubin 3.6 mmol/L), and an international normalized ratio of 0.94. Tumor marker cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) was 14.4 U/mL (normal limit: < 34 U/mL) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was 0.6 ng/mL (normal limit: < 5 ng/mL).\nAbdominal ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a large, ill-defined, heterogeneous mass completely replacing the gallbladder body and fundus with an extensive involvement of the adjacent liver segments, the duodenum, the head of the pancreas, and the hepatic flexure of the colon (Figures -). There were several, enlarged, loco-regional lymph nodes with no other lesions suspicious of distant metastatic disease. There was no intra- or extrahepatic biliary tree dilatation confirmed by magnetic resonance cholangiography.\nAdvanced stage IIIb-IVa CG was the main differential diagnosis and the possibility of acute or chronic cholecystitis with diffuse mass-forming XG was lower on the list. A detailed discussion of the possible intraoperative scenarios and the extent of the surgical resection with the risks, benefits, and prognosis was carried out, and informed consent was obtained. Surgical exploration confirmed the preoperative imaging findings and revealed a mass occupying the entire subhepatic space adherent to the adjacent liver segments, omentum, hepatoduodenal ligament, the second portion of the duodenum, and proximal one-third of the transverse colon. No intra-abdominal collections, abscesses or lesions suspicious of metastatic malignant disease were seen. Intra-operative frozen-section biopsies were not performed. Despite the extensive fibrosis and adhesions, we were able to define and dissect through soft tissue planes and safely separate the involved structures to perform a resection of the entire mass with adjacent liver segments and loco-regional lymph nodes for proper staging and prognosis.\nSurgical pathology revealed an 8x11 cm XG tumor with diffuse, marked thickening of the gallbladder wall (up to 1.5 cm) and lumen filled with spongiform purulent matter. Histology showed deep, ruptured Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses penetrating the muscle layer with areas of tumor-resembling adenomyosis (Figure ). There were multiple foci of crowding of foamy macrophages and xanthoma cells (Figure ) alongside foreign body granulomas consisting of cholesterol (Figure ) and tiny bile lakes (Figure ). There were mild to moderate reactive inflammatory changes of the adjacent hepatic tissue with lymphocytic infiltration of portal tracts and fatty degeneration. No atypical cells or malignant cells were observed and the enlarged periportal lymph nodes showed a nonspecific inflammatory reaction.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged home on day seven after surgery.

{"clinical_note": "Our patient was a 19-year-old primigravida Greek Pomak woman who was recently diagnosed as having hereditary AT deficiency. She had been previously referred for thrombophilia testing, due to a history of two first trimester pregnancy losses. She had no history of deep vein thrombosis (VTE), but her mother had suffered from postpartum VTE at a young age. Her basic screening for thrombophilia was normal: protein C, free protein S, AT, activated protein C (APC) resistance, lupus anticoagulant, FV Leiden, factor II (FII) G20210A mutation, fasting serum homocysteine, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1 (anti-b2 GP1) antibodies; however, she showed an AT activity of 51% (normal range 70\u2013120%; chromogenic Liquid Antithrombin; Instrumentation Laboratory, Milano, Italy). Her mother and two out of three of her siblings were also found to have AT deficiency, so a diagnosis of hereditary heterozygous AT deficiency was established. AT antigen testing was not available so we cannot classify the disorder as type I or II deficiency.\nThree months after diagnosis she was pregnant again. We decided to manage her with adjusted dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) throughout pregnancy due to the high incidence of fetomaternal complications in this disorder and our patient\u2019s history of miscarriages. She was monitored monthly with d-dimers, AT activity, and anti-Xa measurements (liquid anti-Xa, one-stage chromogenic assay with no exogenous AT; Instrumentation Laboratory, Milano, Italy). After titrating tinzaparin dose, using chromogenic anti-Xa activity, she continued with a daily dose of 14,000 IU applied subcutaneously. With this dose the peak anti-Xa activity ranged between 0.46 and 0.79 IU/ml during the first 6 months of pregnancy, which was in great discordance with her body weight of 50 kg. This was attributed to the well-known heparin resistance phenomenon in patients with AT deficiency. During the last trimester anti-Xa activity dropped and ranged between 0.23 and 0.45 IU/ml. An attempt to raise the heparin dose did not result in significant increase in anti-Xa, but further decreased the AT levels; so we resumed the 14,000 IU dose. Throughout pregnancy d-dimers were low (93\u2013317 \u03bcg/L) and AT was 33\u201335% until the 28th week, rising to 46\u201357% thereafter. Her pregnancy was uneventful. A cesarean section was scheduled at the 39th week due to breech presentation of the fetus. The last tinzaparin dose was given 24 hours before surgery. Prior to delivery, AT activity was 54%. In order to overcome the risk of thrombosis, 3 hours before delivery she received Kybernin P (human AT III concentrate; CSL Behring) prophylactically at a dose of 3000 IU intravenously administered, calculated according to current recommendations as follows: concentrate dose = (120% \u2212 current AT(%)) \u00d7 body weight (kg) divided by 1.4. She proceeded to have general anesthesia and received tinzaparin subcutaneously 8 hours later at the conventional dose of 4500 IU. She delivered a healthy, 2610 g weight, small for gestational age male baby, who was also tested a year later and was found to have normal AT levels. There was no increased bleeding during and after caesarean section. Her AT level 2 hours after infusion was 112% and trough level the next day was 65%. Functional AT levels were measured daily prior to each dose of AT and levels were maintained between 60 and 100% by using approximately 66% of the initial AT dose or 2000 IU. We planned to administer AT for 6 days, according to various literature data, but in total she received AT for 4 days because she developed an allergic reaction after the fifth dose, so AT was discontinued and tinzaparin increased at the prior dose of 14,000 IU/day. She was discharged 6 days after delivery without complications and tinzaparin 4500 IU daily was continued for 6 weeks postpartum.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows individual\u2019s risk factors for development of condition', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Clinical examination revealed a heavily restored maxillary left central incisor that was tender to palpation (Fig. A,B) and periapical radiograph and a CBCT revealed an oblique crown-root fracture that extended approximately one-third of the root length (Fig. C,D). Radiographic findings showed periapical radiolucencies in the adjacent upper left lateral incisor and canine (Fig. C), both teeth remaining negative to cold testing. The diagnosis was a globulomaxillary cyst, both teeth were root canal treated (Fig. E) and the cyst enucleated (Fig. F).\nIn order to regain the lost biologic width, orthodontic extrusion of the fractured permanent maxillary central incisor was required to move the vestibular fracture line approximately 6 mm above the alveolar crest. For the orthodontic extrusion, brackets were attached from upper right first premolar to upper left first premolar.

Her medical history found no outstanding findings that would contribute to treatment problems. Clinical examination revealed that the tooth had a MOD composite restoration. This was tender on percussion, and hence the patient reported periodic episodes of spontaneous pain. The periapical radiographic examination, with an orthoradial projection, showed the presence of a single root with an unusual anatomic variation, suggesting a probable endodontic dilacerated anatomy.\nThe endodontic treatment was performed in a single session. After local anesthesia, a rubber dam was placed, and endodontic access was performed with a # C 801L 012 round diamond bur (NTI, Kahla, Germany).

Length determination was obtained using an electronic apex locator (Root ZX; J Morita Co, Kyoto, Japan).\nAt this point of therapy we took a radiograph to allow subsequent execution of the following steps:\nGlide path until to a full working length in both the buccal and palatal canals with a One G (300 rpm/5 Ncm) instrument.\nShaping canals in minimal invasive way was performed with TS1 (300 rpm/2 Ncm), 25/04, extending until to full length of the buccal canal, until to the merged point for the palatal canal in order to avoid an apical zip and hazardous stress with the endodontic instrument, especially dangerous when navigating second canal curvatures.\nApical gauging: the foramen was gauged introducing a 25/02 NiTi hand file, which was snug at its working length.\nAfter the shaping procedure, in order to assure a three-dimensionally cleaning of the root canal system, an aqueous 17% solution of EDTA flooded into the pulp chamber was activated using a manual-dynamic activation by of some gutta-percha points for 120 seconds in each canal. After rinsing with physiological saline, a solution 6% of NaOCl flooded into the pulp chamber was activated again using a manual-dynamic activation for 120 seconds in each canal.\nThe canal system was then dried using sterile paper points. After having applied a drop of Kerr EWT pulp canal sealer (Kerr, Romulus, MI) with a coated paper point at the entrance of each canal, both canals were filled with Thermafil 2.

Length determination was taken using an electronic apex locator (Root ZX; J Morita Co, Kyoto, Japan).\nA mechanical glide-path with proglider at working length was performed using an endodontic engine (300 rpm/5 Ncm).\nRoot canal preparation was performed by preparing the root canals to working length with a ProTaper Next X1, a Pro Taper Next X2 (operating at 300 rpm and torque of 5 N/cm) 2.5 mm shorter from the WL.

The shaping procedure was finished after 6\u2019 17\u2019\u2019.\nAfter the shaping procedure, in order to assure a three-dimensionally cleaning of the root canal system, an aqueous 17% solution of EDTA was flooded into the pulp chamber was then activated using a manual-dynamic activation by a gutta-percha point for 120 seconds in each canal. After rinsing with physiological saline, a solution 6% of NaOCl flooded into the pulp chamber was activated using a manual-dynamic activation for 120 seconds in each canal.\nThen the canal system was dried using sterile paper points. After having applied a drop of EWT pulp canal sealer (Kerr) with a coated paper point in the entrance of each canal, both sites were filled with Thermafil 25. The final radiographs showed two well-obturated canals, with some lateral canal, of this single rooted maxillary premolar (Fig. ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "An 8-year-old female spayed Dachshund weighing 7.45 kg was presented to the University of Tennessee Veterinary Medical Center with a large, firm, bilaterally symmetrical, painful protrusion in the perineal region that had appeared acutely 2 days before presentation. The dog had a one-month history of dysuria and pollakiuria that was suspected to be a urinary tract infection; when the dog did not respond to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, a free catch urine sample was submitted for culture. A few colonies of a Staphylococcus organism were grown from the culture, and treatment was changed to marbofloxacin. The dog also had a 2-day history of tenesmus associated with the appearance of the perineal protrusion. The dog had been spayed 2 years prior to presentation after multiple types of unsuccessful breeding.\nPhysical exam abnormalities revealed an otherwise normal dog with an approximately 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2 cm firm, painful protrusion on midline of her perineal region, ventral to the anus. A fluid-filled structure was noted ventral to the rectum and distal colon on digital rectal exam; no pelvic diaphragm weakness was palpable, making perineal hernia unlikely. Serum chemistry and complete blood count were unremarkable.\nThe dog was anesthetized for computed tomography (CT) and vaginoscopy. On abdominal and perineal CT (Figures \u2013), a large, tubular, fluid-filled structure was noted, measuring 4 cm in diameter at its widest point and 16.3 cm long. The structure extended from the perineum cranially, blindly terminating at the level of L5. It occupied the majority of the pelvic canal and much of the caudal abdomen, compressing the colon and rectum dorsally and the urethra ventrally and displacing the bladder within the abdomen to the left of midline. There was also mild dilation of both renal pelves and proximal ureters, which could have been secondary to pyelonephritis or backpressure from the dilated urinary bladder. The structure was interpreted to be the vagina and uterine stump and, based on results of physical exam, blood work, and CT, a hydrocolpos secondary to imperforate hymen was suspected. The ratio of vestibulovaginal junction width to maximal vaginal width was 0.825, ruling out vestibulovaginal stenosis.\nOn digital vaginal exam, a large, thin-walled, fluctuant structure was palpably filling the vaginal lumen just cranial to the urethral meatus. Digital pressure was used against the wall of the structure to perforate it; approximately 200 mL of brown, mucoid fluid was immediately released from the vulva. A sample was collected for cytology and culture. Within a minute, the drainage had ceased, and vaginoscopy was performed, revealing remnants of an imperforate hymen just cranial to the external urethral orifice. No fluid remained in the distended vagina, and no other abnormalities were seen. The remainder of the hymen was removed endoscopically with grasping forceps and submitted for histopathology.\nOn cytology, the fluid was moderately cellular, primarily consisting of neutrophils with rare clusters of epithelial cells. No bacteria were seen on cytology, and no organisms were cultured from the fluid. Histologically, the tissue was composed of a dense band of fibrous connective tissue covered by a nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium. It contained a medium-sized blood vessel and several smaller blood vessels that were surrounded by rare neutrophils. Findings were consistent with the hymen of a nonpregnant mammal. After recovery, the dog's dysuria, pollakiuria, and perineal swelling resolved. The dog was discharged with instructions to complete the previously prescribed course of marbofloxacin.

{"clinical_note": "Case 1 was a 28 kg, 11-year-old, neutered male Border Collie that presented with malaise, inappetence, and external signs of internal bleeding. Ultrasonography demonstrated a large renal mass and evidence of metastatic spread to the lungs. A biopsy of the renal mass was performed, and histological examination revealed sarcoma of endothelial origin.\nUnder the care of a licensed veterinarian, this dog was entered into our research protocol employing high dose oral DHEA (60 mg/kg/day) and ubiquinone (0.1 mg/kg/day), in divided daily doses. A dramatic improvement in quality of life (appetite, playfulness) occurred within a few days of initiation of the protocol. The patient was reexamined at biweekly intervals by his veterinarian, and complete blood chemistry panels were routinely performed, without identification of significant abnormalities. By one month of treatment, repeat ultrasonography demonstrated no further growth of the renal mass, that is, stable disease. However, the dog developed a generalized inflammatory condition that involved the skin, eyes, and nasal passages. Skin lesions ranged from nonpruritic maculopapular rash to urticaria, erythema nodosum, and purpura. The oral mucosa was inflamed, and uveitis was prominent. There was also episodic fever and an apparent increase in the patient's arthritis. Because the dog's owner had previously fed him large amounts of vegetable matter rich in phytates, the inflammatory reaction was originally postulated to be due to zinc deficiency caused by phytate sequestering of this critical metal. Zinc deficiency is known to produce symptoms very similar to those observed in this case. However, zinc supplementation did not improve his condition, and alternative causes for the inflammatory reaction were sought.\nBased upon our earlier in vitro work [, ], we considered the possibility that inhibition of the mevalonate pathway might be the cause of the autoinflammatory reaction observed. This proved to be the case. Administration of oral, encapsulated geraniol (60/mg/kg/day) was followed by a rapid clearing (3.5 days) of all lesions. This dog survived 315 days from original diagnosis, with pulmonary metastasis being the cause of death.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}
{"clinical_note": "Case 2 is a four-and-one-half-year-old, 28.4 kg, intact female Doberman pinscher who presented with lameness in her rear right leg in November of 2013. At that time, she was diagnosed with decreased conscious proprioception in the right hind limb. The patient was subsequently referred to the Oregon State University College of Veterinary Medicine in October of 2015 after presenting with non-weight bearing lameness and muscle atrophy on the right hind limb. Radiology of the hips revealed periosteal reaction on the right ischiatic table with a mass-like effect in the adjacent musculature. Ultrasound of the musculature adjacent to the right ischium showed an intramuscular mass. A fine needle aspirate of the mass was performed and confirmed a soft tissue sarcoma. Amputation followed by traditional chemotherapy was recommended, which was declined by the owners of this dog. The patient's hepatorenal values were also noted to be consistently elevated, which would potentially have complicated traditional chemotherapy.\nThis dog was entered into our G6PD inhibition protocol in October of 2015 and was treated daily with 60 mg/kg/day DHEA and 0.1 mg/kg/day ubiquinone. During treatment, an acute inflammatory reaction involving the eyes was noted (). This was followed by multiple inflammatory cutaneous lesions on the legs, foot pads, and trunk (). These lesions closely resembled those observed in Case 1. Additionally, this dog had intermittent episodes of fever and an apparent increase in arthralgia. Upon administration of oral geraniol (60 mg/kg/day in divided doses for seven days), all symptoms completely subsided. Of note, posttreatment radiographs showed complete tumor regression (). As of May 2017, this patient is alive and well with no evidence of tumor recurrence or recurring inflammation. Incidentally, she became pregnant during high dose DHEA treatment, subsequently delivering five healthy puppies, demonstrating that G6PD inhibition is surprisingly nontoxic to the developing fetus.\nBesides the similarity in gross appearance of the skin lesions, histologically both cases showed a neutrophilic exudate, and numerous bacteria (cocci or coccobacilli) were visible in surface keratin and hair follicles. There was a diffuse infiltrate of plasma cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils and, in Case 1, clear hypertrophy of dermal sebaceous and apocrine glands. Additionally, both cases responded to geraniol with clearing of the autoinflammatory lesions. In subsequent studies, it was demonstrated that simultaneous administration of geraniol or other terpenes with DHEA could prevent the formation of such autoinflammatory lesions.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A six-year-old female boxer dog presented with a 13-month history of progressive and mildly pruritic skin lesions. The dog was current on vaccinations and deworming and was being fed on dry commercial food of high quality. Previous treatments included amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (20 mg/Kg/12 h), cefalexin (25 mg/Kg/12 h) alone or in combination with prednisolone (0.5 mg/Kg/24 h for 1 week and then every other day) for a period of approximately 3 to 4 weeks each, but of no avail. The owner also reported that the dog had intermittently been experiencing nonambulatory lameness on the right front leg.\nPhysical examination of the dog upon admission revealed no abnormality. On dermatological examination, 9 ulcerated and nonulcerated skin nodules were observed, ranged from 1 to 7 cm in diameter, and distributed mainly over bony prominences of distal extremities and digits of the front legs (), left elbow, and right hock. Other skin lesions included footpad hyperkeratosis, crusting, depigmentation, and erosions ().\nAt that time the main differentials included infectious or sterile nodules and neoplasia.\nFine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology made from material obtained from nonulcerated skin nodules revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation and numerous mainly extracellular round-shaped organisms, ranging from 20 to 30 \u03bcm in diameter, most containing 2 spores of approximately 10 \u03bcm in diameter. A tentative diagnosis of systemic mycosis was made. Culture of FNA material in dermatophyte test medium (DTM) was performed at room temperature. Furthermore, skin biopsies were obtained from intact nodules (the owner refused footpad lesions biopsy) along with blood and urine samples for further laboratory workup and serology. Survey thoracic and abdominal radiographs were also taken but were unremarkable.\nHematology, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis did not display any abnormalities and serology (snap ELISA, IDEXX\u00ae) for all of Leishmania infantum, Ehrlichia canis, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum antibodies and Dirofilaria immitis antigen was negative. After 4 days of incubation, smooth, creamy, yeastlike colonies were grown on DTM. Light microscopy of lactophenol cotton blue slide preparations made of these colonies revealed round sporangia containing spherical sporangiospores similar to those of P. wickerhamii (). P. zopfii cells are oval or cylindrical in shape, producing sporangia of larger diameter (15\u201325 \u03bcm) containing up to 20 sporangiospores. In contrast, P. wickerhamii cells tend to be round, forming sporangia (7\u201313 \u03bcm) containing up to 50 spherical sporangiospores [].\nHistopathology revealed nodular-to-diffuse, pyogranulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis (with lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and neutrophils) with numerous elements exhibiting Prototheca spp. morphology; their cell wall stained vividly purple with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain () and most of microorganisms were extracellular, either single or more often in groups, with only a few seen to be phagocytosed.\nApproximately 1 mm3 of culture material was used for DNA isolation, by employing the QIAamp Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), and following the manufacturer's instructions. A portion of the 28S rRNA gene was amplified by using already published primers []. The band was excised from the gel and DNA was isolated using the DNA Isolation Spin-Kit Agarose (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany). The isolated DNA was subsequently sequenced with the PCR primers; PCR produced a ~350 bp band. As sequencing of the complete length of PCR product was not possible, a 77 bp sequence was obtained by employing the U2 primer. Beyond that fragment the double peaks were indicative of the presence of more than 1 strain. Similar sequences were searched in the GenBank with the aid of the Web interface of Blast software which returned 9 of these sequences that belonged to Prototheca wickerhamii strains; the higher similarity applied to GenBank number AB183198 sequence (). This result confirmed the diagnosis of cutaneous protothecosis due to Prototheca wickerhamii.\nAs no treatment guidelines are available, the patient was treated with oral fluconazole (10 mg/Kg twice a day), based on reported agents likely to be most useful against Prototheca species such as amphotericin B (AMB), fluconazole, itraconazole, and possibly terbinafine []. Although significant clinical improvement was witnessed in footpad lesions after one month on fluconazole, this treatment regimen did little to slow the progression of skin nodules, because Prototheca organisms were found on cytology. At that time fluconazole administration was withdrawn and AMB was administered twice weekly as a subcutaneous infusion using a protocol developed to treat canine cryptococcosis []. Specifically, 0.5 mg AMB/Kg/sc per dose was administered twice weekly in 500 mL of 0.45% NaCl/2.5% dextrose fluids. The dog was given concurrently itraconazole (5 mg/Kg/per os, once daily). Due to nephrotoxicity, AMB was withdrawn after 7 infusions and the patient is still being treated with itraconazole alone for about six months. However, although skin nodules have not been improved with this treatment regimen, footpads remain close to normal.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Anamnestically, the animal never conceived despite several attempts at mating. The day of the appointment, the pet expelled a large amount of hemorrhagic material. During the visit, the patient was quiet, depressed, and moderately responsive to stimulation. At physical exam, the patient showed tachypnea, vocalization upon manipulation of the abdomen that was tense, and dilated abdomen with a palpable mass. Ultrasonographic investigation evidenced a large well-defined 2 \u00d7 2 cm mass in the anatomic area of the uterus. The guinea pig underwent emergency surgery upon sedation with an association of butorphanol 0.7 mg/kg (Dolorex 10 mg/ml, MSD), medetomidine 0.07 mg/kg (Sedator 1,0 mg/ml, ATI), and ketamine 7 mg/kg (Imalgene 1000 100 mg/ml, MERIAL) administrated intramuscularly. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 3% with a not cuffed endotracheal tube. The procedure was monitored with a multiparameter monitor, including ECG (II derivation) CO2, O2, and no invasive pressure and temperature. During the anesthesia, intravenous fluid (NaCl 0.9%) was administered at the rate of 5 ml/kg/h with infusion pump via intravenous catheter 24 G (Terumo). Surgical examination of the abdomen evidenced an enlarged and congested ovary and uterus and signs of peritonitis, including intra-abdominal fluid.

Histopathologic analysis revealed characteristic features of endometriosis both in the uterus and in the ovary. In detail, adenomyosis was described in the uterus because of the presence of ectopic glandular tissue in the muscular wall of the uterus (). On the other hand, at the level of the ovary, cystic enlargements filled with fluid were seen macroscopically; histologically, these cystic structures presented the classic glandular epithelium of the endometrium with one layer of cuboidal or tall cells, thus representing classic cystic endometriosis of the ovary (). Immunohistochemical staining was performed, by using the ABC method and diaminobenzidine, by means of specific antibodies for estrogen and CD10 in order to confirm the ability of the glandular epithelium to secrete estrogen and the presence of a stromal reaction surrounding the ectopic endometrial tissue (Figures and ) [, ].

{"clinical_note": "A 3-day-old, 9.5 kg female alpaca cria was presented for progressive weakness and dyspnea of a few hours' duration. The cria had an uneventful birth, stood, nursed, and passed urine and feces normally, but was less active than normal. The cria nursed regularly but only for very short periods. On presentation, the patient was tachycardic (heart rate 148) and appeared to be dyspneic (respiratory rate 28) with cyanosis of the oral mucous membranes and had a capillary refill time of 3 seconds. Cardiac auscultation revealed no significant abnormalities (excluding the tachycardia) and pulse pressure was considered normal. During examination, the cria intermittently lowered its head, became ataxic, and collapsed. These episodes were precipitated by handling or when nursing. After a few moments the cria sat sternal and then stood, appearing normal. Behavior and neurologic exam between episodes were normal. Differential diagnosis included septicemia, pneumonia, choanal atresia, meningitis, persistent fetal circulation, and cardiac abnormalities. No significant abnormalities were noted on complete blood cell count and blood chemistry. Standard lateral thoracic radiographs (evaluated by a board certified veterinary radiologist) revealed slight loss of cranial cardiac waist, distention of the caudal vena cava, and a mild diffuse interstitial lung pattern () without significant evidence of pulmonary venous congestion or overcirculation. A dorsoventral or ventrodorsal view may have provided additional information regarding the heart, but it is not routinely obtained in an unsedated or unanesthetized cria []. An attempt was made to perform upper airway endoscopy to assess for suspected choanal atresia; however, the procedure was aborted as the cria became progressively more distressed. The cria was subsequently anesthetized and placed on 100% oxygen. An endoscopic examination of the nasal passages and distal trachea revealed no significant abnormalities. An arterial blood gas was performed while on oxygen supplementation which revealed a marked hypoxemia (PaO2 19 mmHg, PaCO2 29.6 mmHg, and SaO2% 31.7) making cardiac disease with right to left shunting of blood more likely. As such, with no evidence of respiratory diseases or septicemia as the cause of the clinical signs, a congenital cardiac malformation was highly suspected and a cardiac evaluation was performed.\nTwo-dimensional (2D) echocardiography, color flow, and spectral Doppler examinations were performed under general anesthesia with an ultrasound unit (Vivid 7, General Electric Medical System, Waukesha, WI, USA) equipped with 1.5\u20133.6, 2.2\u20135, and 4.4\u201310 MHz phased-array transducers. Two-dimensional images revealed severe dilation of the right atrium and ventricle. Thickening of the right ventricle free wall was also identified. No significant dilation of the left atrium or thickening of the left ventricle was noted. The interventricular septum (IVS) was flattened and there was paradoxical motion of the IVS. At the base of the IVS a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) was detected (). Additionally, a patent foramen ovale (PFO) was noted in the atrial septum () and a single large artery overriding the VSD was also identified. The right ventricular outflow tract, origins of the pulmonary arteries, and a patent ductus arteriosus could not be visualized during the echocardiographic examination. Systolic function appeared normal as estimated by 27% fractional shortening (normal 32.8 \u00b1 7.6) []. Color flow Doppler evaluation revealed bidirectional but primarily right to left shunting across both the defect in the atrial septum and VSD. Mild regurgitation across mitral, tricuspid, and the valve of the single large artery was noted. A contrast study was performed by injecting agitated heparinized saline into the external jugular vein while viewing the heart from the right parasternal view. Presence of bubbles from the right heart crossing the VSD into the left heart and main artery during systole confirmed the presence of a right to left shunting VSD (; Supplementary Information: Video 1 and Video 2 in Supplementary Material available online at ). Differential diagnosis based on the echocardiographic findings included Tetralogy of Fallot, severe pulmonic stenosis or pulmonary atresia with a VSD, and common arterial trunk (CAT). Surgical implantation of a vascular shunt and open-heart surgical correction of the malformation was discussed with the owners but due to the poor prognosis and limited treatment options, the owner elected humane euthanasia and postmortem examination.\nOn macroscopic examination, there was evidence of both right sided (liver congestion and pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal effusion) and left sided (marked pulmonary edema) congestive heart failure. Examination of the heart revealed marked dilation of the right atrium, a small PFO, a large VSD, and a single large vessel overriding the IVS. The vessel had a mildly thickened quadricuspid valve and appeared to be the only outflow tract for both the right and left ventricles consistent with a CAT. A separate pulmonary artery originating from the right ventricular outflow tract could not be identified despite careful dissection. However, a single pulmonary trunk arose from the common trunk prior to the arch and branched to the right and left pulmonary arteries. A patent ductus arteriosus was not identified. Coronary artery structure appeared to be normal. Histological examination identified the presence of pulmonary edema and hepatic congestion consistent with left and right sided congestive heart failure. There was an incidental finding of a cerebellar pseudocyst.

{"clinical_note": "In July 2015, an 8-month-old female of Staffordshire Bull Terrier, housed in Milan province (northern Italy) and purchased from an Italian dog breeder, was taken to a veterinary clinic on account of her frequent and violent sneezing that lasts for two days. During anamnestic data collection, the owner reported that sneezing occurred after the dog had been taken for a walk in a rural area close to his house. At clinical examination the bitch also presented stertorous and reversal sneezing. Anamnesis, dog breed, and symptoms made clinicians suspect a nasal foreign body and/or a brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome (BAOS). No antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory therapies were being administered to the dog. The bitch was then anesthetized for laryngoscopy, tracheoscopy, and anterior and posterior rhinoscopy. Laryngeal inspection revealed everted laryngeal saccules, whereas tracheoscopy did not show any remarkable alteration. Posterior rhinoscopy evidenced few small mucosal erosions (diameter < 2 mm) surrounded by mildly thickened and oedematous mucosae in the rhinopharynx; a small quantity of mucus-like material was also present. The anterior rhinoscopy highlighted two and three whitish fusiform organisms in the right and in the left nasal cavities, respectively; all the observed organisms appeared to be vital, presenting high mobility on the nasal mucosal surface. Attempts to catch them using endoscopic forceps failed and only after nasal lavage was one of them isolated and collected. Noticeably, following nasal lavage, the acute and violent sneezing improved considerably which might be due to removal of most of the observed organisms. The collected organism resembled a larva of Diptera and while waiting for further investigations after rhinoscopy the dog was also treated for three times every 7 days (days 0, 7, and 14) with subcutaneous administration of 300 \u03bcg/kg of ivermectin. After treatment, sneezing disappeared completely, and only moderate reversal sneezing, probably due to everted laryngeal saccules, remained present. The larva was sent to the Department of Veterinary Medicine of Milan for identification; it was studied under the light microscope and identified according to morphological keys [\u2013]. The specimen was identified as a first instar larval stage (L1) of O. ovis L. (Diptera: Oestridae). The fusiform and dorsoventrally flattened L1, about 1.18 mm long and 0.44 mm wide, was divided into 11 segments (). On its surface, these segments presented trichoid cuticular sensilla (). Such structures are thermosensitive; they allow L1 to both locate and, in association with its quick mobility, rapidly reach the nasal cavities to find a suitable niche for its development. Ventral and lateral clusters of spines were also evident on the larva surface. They measured about 20 \u03bcm and 30 \u03bcm in length, respectively, and their distribution resembled the typical pattern described in Oestrus larvae. In subfamily Oestrinae, lateral and ventral spines can help a larva attach to and move on the host's mucosal surface without being expelled by its sneezing. The larva under investigation showed a distinctive cluster of spines on the terminal abdominal segment, though its bilobated shape was not perfectly preserved. Cranially, a pair of prominent, dark brown oral hooks, connected to the internal cephalopharyngeal skeleton, as well as defined antennal lobes, measuring about 18 \u00d7 22 \u03bcm could be noticed. Broad tracheal trunks, about 20 \u03bcm wide, ended between the tenth and eleventh body segments ().", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions']"}

A wide surgical excision of the entire site with 3 cm margins was performed the following week. The excised tissue contained a regionally extensive, expansile, and infiltrative spindle cell neoplasm surrounded by a pseudocapsule and mild to moderate chronic inflammation with multifocal lymphonodular aggregates. The center of the neoplasm had undergone extensive necrosis, and the myxomatous matrix was admixed with grey-brown globular material. The neoplastic cells were fusiform to spindloid, formed interlacing bundles, and had moderate amounts of darkly eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei were ovoid and had a stippled chromatin pattern with numerous, variably sized prominent nucleoli. There was marked anisokaryosis and anisocytosis. Binucleated and multinucleated cells as well as karyomegaly were multifocally observed. The mitotic count was 20 in 10 high powered fields (HPF, FN22), and there were occasional bizarre mitotic figures ().\nA grade 3 soft tissue sarcoma was diagnosed based on the degree of necrosis, cellular atypia, and the high mitotic count. The neoplasm had narrow but completely excised surgical margins. The surgical wound healed without any complications; however, multiple subcutaneous nodules were identified at the excision site ten weeks later. Repeat fine needle aspiration cytology confirmed a recurrence of the sarcoma. Hematology, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis were unremarkable, and three-view thoracic radiographs did not identify metastatic disease to the lungs. A second, broad excision of the injection site with 3 cm margins was performed. The neoplasm appeared histologically similar to the previously excised grade 3 soft tissue sarcoma with an increased mitotic count of 30/10 HPF. The sarcoma had focally infiltrated the skeletal muscle. Excision was reported to be complete with narrow margins. Neoplastic cells were immunohistochemically positive for Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor receptor (VEGFr) (), Platelet Derived Growth Factor receptor (PDGRr) (), Stem Cell Factor (SCF), and Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and negative for VEGF, PDGR, KIT, and p-53.\nBased on the expression of VEGFr and PDGFr, a response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy with toceranib, a small molecule inhibitor of VEGFr2 and PDGFr\u03b2, was hypothesized. Toceranib was initially administered orally at a dose of 2.1 mg/kg and then increased to 2.8 mg/kg on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule. No adverse effects were noted at these doses and no hypertension or proteinuria was detected. Repeat CBC and serum biochemistry profiles were normal throughout the course of therapy and thoracic radiographs did not show any evidence of metastatic disease. A small cluster of subcutaneous nodules was identified at the excision site fifty weeks after the first surgery and a third complete excision with 3 cm margins was performed. Histology confirmed a recurrence of the grade 3 soft tissue sarcoma and the toceranib was continued. At the time of submission of this manuscript, the dog remains in remission ninety-three weeks after initial diagnosis.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'mechanisms, drugs', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "An eight-year-old, female intact Golden Retriever, weighing 27 kg, was referred for investigation of urinary and faecal incontinence, which acutely appeared following two months of chronic vaginal discharge. The latter partially responded to antibiotic treatment. After neurological consultation, the animal was scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar-sacral region under general anesthesia.\nOn preanesthetic examination the dog appeared slightly nervous but in good physical condition (ASA II). The heart rate was 90 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate was 15 breaths per minute (brpm), pulse quality was good, mucous membranes were pink, and capillary refill time was less than 2 seconds. Thoracic and cardiac auscultation were unremarkable, as were the results of hematological and biochemical blood tests.\nAfter a mild sedation was achieved administering methadone intramuscularly (0.2 mg kg\u22121; Synastone, Auden Mckenzie Ltd., UK), anesthesia was induced intravenously 30 minutes later with fentanyl (3 \u03bcg kg\u22121; Sublimaze, Janssen-Cilag Ltd., UK) and propofol (2.5 mg kg\u22121; Rapinovet, Schering-plough Animal Health UK). The trachea was intubated with a cuffed tube; the cuff was inflated; intubation was unremarkable. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (IsoFlo, Abbott Laboratoires, UK) in 100% oxygen, delivered through a circle system. Monitoring consisted of capnography, measurement of inspired and expired anesthetic gases and oxygen, measurement of noninvasive arterial blood pressure (Datex AS3, Helsinki, Finland), and esophageal stethoscope.\nShortly after commencement of isoflurane administration, a gasping breathing pattern was noted, with a respiratory rate of 40\u201350 brpm and jerk movements of the mouth and all four limbs. Heart rate was 140 bpm. Inadequate depth of anesthesia was considered the cause of the observed movements; thus ventilation was assisted manually (15 brpm) and the vaporizer setting was increased from 2% to 3% (oxygen 3 L min\u22121) in order to deepen the anesthetic plane. Further, a bolus of fentanyl (1 \u03bcg kg\u22121) was administered intravenously. At that time, end-expiratory carbon dioxide tension (PE\u2032CO2) was 22 mmHg. Because the respiratory pattern did not change during the following 10 minutes, and suspecting an underlying pulmonary disease, MRI was cancelled while thoracic radiographs and an arterial blood gases analysis were performed. Radiographs were unremarkable and alkalemia due to primary respiratory alkalosis was apparent in the arterial blood gases analysis results (). The dog was allowed to recover from general anesthesia. Once the vaporizer was turned off and the breathing system flushed with oxygen, the dog's breathing pattern improved and became normal. The recovery from general anesthesia was uneventful. MRI was rescheduled for the following day.\nOn day 2, preanesthetic assessment was unremarkable and similar to that obtained the previous day. Dexmedetomidine (1.25 \u00b5g kg\u22121 Dexdomitor, Orion Pharma, Finland) and methadone (0.25 mg kg\u22121) were administered slowly intravenously. The resulting sedative effect was good with the animal relaxed in lateral recumbency. Anesthesia was induced with propofol (1.5 mg kg\u22121) and, after intubation of the trachea with a cuffed tube, maintained with isoflurane (vaporizer setting was 3%) in 100% oxygen at the flow of 3 L min\u22121, delivered through a circle system. Also in this occasion tracheal intubation was unremarkable.\nAs on day 1, the animal started gasping and jerking continuously as soon it was connected to the breathing system. At that point, isoflurane was immediately turned off and the breathing system flushed with pure oxygen. Anesthesia was then maintained with a constant rate infusion (CRI) of propofol (0.3 mg kg\u22121 min\u22121), after slow administration of a loading dose (0.5 mg kg\u22121). As the animal's breathing pattern did not improve, atracurium (0.2 mg kg\u22121, Tracrium Injection, GlaxoSmithKline, UK) was administered intravenously and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (Penlon Nuffield 200 ventilator) was started to maintain eucapnia (PE\u2032CO2 35\u201345 mmHg). Respiratory rate was set to 15 breathes per minute, tidal volume was 300 mL, and peak inspiratory pressure was 12 cmH2O. The rest of the anesthetic time was uneventful, but it was necessary to top up atracurium every 15\u201320 minutes, because hiccups restarted as soon as neuromuscular function started returning.\nAn extensive invasive sacrococcygeal neoplasia was found on MRI. The owner decided to euthanize the dog but declined postmortem examination.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 45-day-old male Saanen kid was presented to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, College of Veterinary Medicine, Sudan University of Science and Technology, with a history of an increasing swelling over prescrotal region.\nOn physical examination, the kid was found to be alert. The temperature, pulse, and respiratory rates were found within the normal range. A fluid-filled pocket (Figures and ) ventral to the penile urethra was seen and the urine was observed dripping from the prepuce and urethral process. Manual compression of the diverticulum showed subcutaneous urine leakage. Only a small amount of urine could be voided from the external urethral opening.\nNeedle centesis of the pocket revealed a presence of a fluid which was confirmed as urine on physical and chemical examination. Ultrasonographic examination was done on the right flank of the kid to visualize the kidneys. A real-time ultrasound scanner (Pie Medical Esaote, Aquila, Netherlands) equipped with switchable frequency (3.5\u20135) MHz curvilinear probe was used. Both kidneys were normal. The urinary bladder was also assessed and it was full of urine. Blood sample was taken for a complete blood count which revealed normal values. Urinalysis was also done and it was within the reference range. No other congenital anomalies, such as cryptorchidism or hermaphrodism, were identified.\nThe kid was referred to surgery. The animal was sedated using xylazine (Xylovet 20 mg/mL-Cp-Pharma) at a dose rate of 0.15 mg/kg. The site of operation was aseptically prepared with iodine (yamidine-povidone-iodine 10% USP). The site was locally infiltrated by lidocaine (Lignox 2%-Indoco) and finally draped for surgery.\nUrethral diverticulectomy was performed by elliptical skin incision around the dorsal border of the diverticulum after complete evacuation of urine using a 10 cc syringe. After incising the subcutaneous tissue, two hypospadiac urethral fistulae were identified. A small one () was found in the cranial part of the penis 1 cm ventrocaudal to the urethral process. The other large one () was found 5 cm caudal to the small one and cranial to the scrotum. Urethral catheterization was performed before closing the 1st urethral opening. The other opening could not be corrected due to catheterization failure.\nIncision on the urethral mucosa was extended through the opening and then sutured together to close the opening through simple interrupted sutures using polyglycolic acid, size 2/0; Huai'an Pingan Medical Instrument Co. Ltd., China.\nSubcutaneous tissues were sutured through simple continuous suture using absorbable surgical suture, Truglyde USP (size, 1, suture India PVT, Ltd). Finally, the skin was sutured by horizontal mattress using Ethilon polyamide, size 1, Ethicon Ltd. UK. After finishing operation, antibiotic injections were given to the animal (Penicillin-Penivet) for five days. The wound was dressed daily till the stitches were removed after 10 days.

{"clinical_note": "An 11-year-old boy reported to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery, Bhimavaram, Andhra Pradesh, India, with a chief complaint of swelling over the left cheek since three months. The swelling was asymptomatic and gradually progressing. A detailed history from the attending parent revealed no significant medical history and no previous history of trauma in the concerned area. On an extraoral examination, there was a gross facial asymmetry on the left side of the face due to the presence of a swelling that extended superiorly from the infraorbital margin to the upper lip inferiorly, obliterating the nasolabial fold. No secondary changes were noticed over the skin. There was no sensory deficit in relation to the facial structures. On a thorough intraoral examination, dentition was mixed, with mild caries affecting the deciduous teeth, none involving the pulp, and revealed a bicortical swelling on the left side extending from the labial frenum medially till the distal aspect of the deciduous second molar, obliterating the labial and buccal vestibule (Figure )\nAn orthopantomogram (OPG) revealed a well-defined unilocular radiolucent lesion circumscribing the permanent teeth buds of the central, lateral incisor and canine in the second quadrant (Figure ). It measured around 3 cm in its greatest dimension.\nThe paranasal sinus (PNS) view revealed radiolucency extending superiorly till the infraorbital margin with the canine involved (Figure ). The canine was in Nolla\u2019s stage 7 and the central and lateral incisors were in stage 8.\nAspiration of the cystic contents revealed a straw-colored fluid. Based on the clinical and radiographic findings, a provisional diagnosis of a dentigerous cyst was made (Figure ). A differential diagnosis of unicystic ameloblastoma and a cyst involving the maxillary antrum were considered. Based on the above diagnosis, the patient was planned for decompression of the lesion under general anesthesia. After obtaining a procedural and general anesthesia consent from the parents, a thorough pre-anesthetic evaluation was carried out and the obtained routine blood investigation parameters were within normal limits.\nUnder general anesthesia, the extraction of the deciduous central, lateral incisors and canine was done and an opening was created in the anterior wall of the cyst through which part of the lining was removed and sent for histopathological examination. To maintain the patency of the opening, a marsupialization catheter device customized from the tip of a suction catheter (Figure ) was inserted through the opening and was secured to the margins using 3-0 silk sutures (Figure ). Parents were instructed to irrigate the cystic cavity using normal saline twice a day for a period of one month, through the opening.\nThe histopathological report obtained confirmed the diagnosis of a dentigerous cyst. The patient was regularly recalled every week and was assessed for the maintenance of patency through the device. Radiographs were taken at regular intervals to aid in assessing the eruption of the impacted permanent teeth. Device removal was performed after three months (Figure ).\nAfter a period of three months, the radiographic examination revealed a gradual resolution of the radiolucency of the lesion and a spontaneous eruption of the central and lateral incisors, indicating osteogenesis (Figure ). So, during a subsequent visit, the patient was referred to the department of orthodontics for the assistive eruption of permanent teeth into the dental arch through traction.\nInitially, brackets were bonded on the central and lateral incisors and the canine and the flap was closed. Strap-up was done with 0.016 Niti wire. Later, leveling and alignment was done for about six months with 0.0018 Niti 17x25 Niti, 19x25 Niti, 19x25 SS (Figure and Figure ). After reaching 21x25 SS, wire traction was applied using ligature wire. After the eruption of the central and lateral incisors, an open coil spring was placed for the alignment of the canine after gaining space (Figure ). The canine was brought into occlusion and finishing and detailing were done. The entire treatment spanned five years for all the three impacted teeth to get aligned in the dental arch (Figure and Figure ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 63-year-old man with a deep vein thrombosis diagnosed 5 days prior, presented with fever, tachycardia, and nausea/vomiting. The patient had a past medical history of cerebrovascular accident 9 years prior with residual left-sided weakness, epilepsy, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient denied smoking, alcohol, or drug use. The patient was transferred from an acute rehab center where a left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis had been found on ultrasound 5 days prior, and anticoagulation started. He was bridged from enoxaparin to oral warfarin. Initial laboratories were as follows: white blood cell count 12,600/mL\n3\n, hemoglobin 14.0 g/dL, platelet 302,000/mL\n3\n, total bilirubin 2.1 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 68 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 56 IU/L, prothrombin time 20.3 seconds, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.95, albumin 3.1, fibrin degradation products > 10 and < 40, blood urea nitrogen 14, and serum creatinine 0.83. Initial physical exam showed left lower lobe decreased breath sounds, and an unremarkable abdominal exam. At that time, the patient denied any pain, current nausea/vomiting, shortness of breath, constipation, or diarrhea. Chest X-ray suggested consolidation in the left lower lobe. The decision was made to admit the patient as he met the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome, possibly due to a left lower lobe pneumonia versus pulmonary embolism. For further evaluation, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered. While the CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism or pneumonia, it did incidentally reveal a distended appearance to the gallbladder (\n). Ultrasound showed distended gallbladder with a heterogeneous mixture of intermediate and low echogenic material with no evidence of stones, which was concerning for possible pus or hemorrhage. Liver was of normal size and echogenicity. Patient was started on ceftazidime, clindamycin, and vancomycin empirically for systemic inflammatory response syndrome/sepsis. The patient was initially ruled out as a surgical candidate due to his elevated INR, and given his extensive deep vein thrombosis, it was felt that the risk of stopping anticoagulation outweighed the benefits and he was recommended for interventional radiology (IR)-guided cholecystostomy. Repeat physical exam on hospital day #2 revealed a firm, tender right upper quadrant of the abdomen, with all other quadrants being soft and nontender. The patient's INR spiked to 6.28 on hospital day #2 and his hemoglobin dropped to 9.8 g/dL. This elevation of his INR was attributed to his continued anticoagulation, which was subsequently discontinued. INR on hospital day #3 was 4.53, and 4.94 on hospital day #4, at which point vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma were administered. INR improved to 1.69 on hospital day #5. IR-guided cholecystostomy was attempted on hospital day #4. The decision to proceed with an IR-guided approach had been made earlier as it was felt he was at high risk for surgery and septic. However, there was an organized clot with no drainable material and subsequently no drain left in place. An inferior vena cava filter was placed on hospital day #8. The family and patient had also up to this point refused surgery due to his history of stroke, do not resuscitate/do not intubate status, and their perceived risk of surgery. However, they eventually agreed to have surgery. On hospital day #11, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, and revealed dense adhesions surrounding the gallbladder including the omentum and bowel. These adhesions were taken down to reveal a very large distended gallbladder with areas of necrosis and perforation. The contents of the gallbladder contained approximately 1,000 cubic centimeters of old clot which had perforated near the infundibulum with clot extending out into Morison's pouch and the right upper quadrant causing dense adhesions to the liver. The gallbladder was freed from these adhesions and the clot was removed. The gallbladder was dissected and freed from surrounding adhesions. The cystic duct was secured with a \u201cPDS Endoloop\u201d made by Ethicon. During the course of the operation, patient experienced significant bleeding and required four units of packed red blood cells. The operation was converted to an open cholecystectomy to obtain hemostasis, and a Jackson-Pratt drain was left in place. Pathology of the gallbladder specimen showed extensive hemorrhage, acute inflammation, and necrosis. Pathology of a liver specimen showed moderate fibrosis, which was suggestive of cirrhosis. However, hepatitis serology was all negative, and ultrasound of the liver showed a liver of normal size and echogenicity. No other investigation showed signs of chronic liver disease. Patient had one episode of bleeding from his drain which required transfusion, but the remainder of his hospital course was otherwise uneventful. The patient was considered too high risk for further anticoagulation and was discharged with an inferior vena cava filter in place.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

She was living in a small village in Mianeh, East Azerbaijan Province, Iran ().\nThe latitude for Mianeh is: 37.426434 and the longitude is 47.724111. The patient declared a regular picking and eating local watercress in the rural area. She was admitted to a local hospital and was treated symptomatically. Despite treatment, fever, jaundice, right upper quadrant abdominal pain and loss of appetite continued for 6 months. Informed consent was taken from the patient.\nInitial laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cells 4.3\u00d7103 \u03bcL, platelets 245 \u00d7103 \u03bcL, hemoglobin 12.3 g/dL, hematocrit 37.9%. Peripheral blood smear revealed eosinophilia as high as 36% of the white blood cells. Stool examination was negative for ova/cysts. Liver function tests showed elevated liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase 37 [normal < 31] U/L, alanine transaminase 63 [normal < 32] U/L, alkaline phosphatase 458 [normal 98\u2013279] U/L and a normal total bilirubin.\nAbdominal ultrasonography showed splenomegaly (140 mm). A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed an ill-defined lesion of 96\u00d753 mm at 4th and 8th segments of liver with dilation of intrahepatic bile ducts inside the lesion and splenomegaly was seen. The initial pre-treatment CT imaging revealed a hepatosplenomegaly with regional lymphadenopathy and several subcapsular lesions in both liver lobes.\nIn the search for a potential malignancy, liver biopsy was performed. Section from liver tissue showed focal lobular necrosis with peripheral palisading spindle-shape epithelioid cells; surrounded by moderate inflammatory cells mainly eosinophils and plasma cells beside a few lymphocytes. Other parts of liver tissue showed mild infiltration of a few eosinophils, lymphocytes and few plasma cells without piecemeal necrosis or bile duct damage, which led to the suspicion of a parasitic infection (toxocariasis, capillariasis or strongyloidiasis).\nOn May 24, 2016, the patient was referred to the Department of Medical Parasitology and Mycology of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. After reviewing the clinical / para-clinical findings and interviewing, fascioliasis was suspected. ELISA test was performed as previously described (). Antibodies specific to Fasciola ES antigens were detected in the serum sample. Furthermore, the formalin ether concentration technique showed the presence of F. gigantica eggs (135 \u03bcm-80 \u03bcm) in feces ().\nEgaten treatment was started at the dose of 10 mg/kg. The drug was given as a single oral dose. Three months after treatment, the patient was examined again, fecal examination was negative for F. gigantica eggs, and IgG titers decreased but remained positive during 9 subsequent months. Blood examinations revealed an improvement in the liver function tests with a decrease in blood eosinophil counts (5%)\nIn order to provide genetic diagnosis, the stool sample was washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove the ethanol. The egg walls were mechanically disrupted using glass beads (0.45\u20130.52 mm diameter) and by freezing and heating (\u221270 \u00b0C for 5 min and 90 \u00b0C for 5 min).

{"clinical_note": "A 61-year-old man underwent resection of a part of his tongue due to tongue cancer and was admitted to our hospital for hepatocellular carcinoma with about 5 cm diameter of tumor at the liver segment IV. Computed tomography (CT) showed that the tumor was enhanced during the arterial phase and washed out during the portal phase, and the tumor pressed the right anterior branch to the main branch of Glisson and the middle hepatic vein; hence, the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was made (Fig. ). The indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min was 21.8%. Child-Pugh score was A. The patient tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody. He had a history of excessive consumption of alcohol, and alcoholic liver damage was considered as a possibility. Partial hepatectomy with segments IV + V and cholecystectomy with cystic duct-tube drainage were performed. Intraoperative findings indicated that the anterior branch of bile duct was exposed at the resected area, and some small bile ducts were ligated. On POD 1 following hepatectomy, bile leakage developed from the drain placed in the foramen of Winslow. CT showed fluid collection in the cavity between the liver and fistula to drain. Cholangiography via the endoscopic bile duct enhancement showed no communication between the common bile duct and abdominal cavity. Drip infusion cholangiography (DIC)-CT revealed the bile duct of the peripheral side. We maintained simple drainage to reduce the cavity. On POD 19, this patient had fever and CT revealed that the fluid collection has increased (Fig. ). Percutaneous drainage to the cavity near the liver cut surface was performed. Cholangiography via the c-tube did not show the anterior branch of the bile duct. Fistulogram from the drainage tube at the abdominal cavity showed the bile duct at segments V and VIII (Fig. ). We diagnosed the bile leakage from the isolated bile duct of segments V and VIII. Further management was needed to control the persistent biliary leak of 200\u2013250 mL/day. Liver function was evaluated again. The indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min was 27.7%. LHL15 was 0.575. Liver volume of segments V and VIII was 260 mL, and remnant liver volume was 1272 mL, which were calculated using the 3D image analysis system (SYNAPSE VINCENT; Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Functional remnant liver volume (FRLV) was calculated based on the liver volume using gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced MRI for 20 min []. FRLV after liver resection of segments V and VIII was 2176 mL. Even if the function becomes extinct by PTPE to segment V and VIII, remnant liver volume was sufficient. We considered that bile leakage could not be cured with either PTPE or bile duct ablation alone, because of the large volume of bile leakage more than 200 mL per day. The therapeutic strategy involved combination therapy of PTPE and bile duct ablation. First, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography drainage (PTCD) tube was inserted to the bile duct of segment V. PTPE with coil embolization was performed to the part of the portal vein of segments V and VIII by puncturing the part of the portal vein of segment V. The liver volume of segments V and VIII was decreased from 260 to 123 mL after PTPE. After the PTPE, bile leakage decreased to about 50 mL/day. We confirmed that cholangiography via the PTCD tube showed the bile duct at segments V and VIII. For bile duct ablation, 1.2 mL pure ethanol was injected from the PTCD tube. Over 1.2 mL of ethanol leaked into the abdominal cavity. After ethanol injection, the PTCD tubes were clamped for 5 min. Then, another bile duct ablation with 2.0 mL of pure ethanol was performed 1 week after of the first procedure. After bile duct ablation, bile leakage has decreased from 50 to 10 mL/day gradually. The patient left the hospital, and he was rehospitalized and reinjected with 2.0 mL of pure ethanol for three times. The drainage tube and bile duct tube were removed on POD 139 (Fig. ).

{"clinical_note": "A 30-year old woman presented with two weeks of left lower quadrant discomfort during her second month of pregnancy. Ultrasound revealed a mixed cystic and solid left adnexal mass measuring 8.6 \u00d7 6.7 \u00d7 8.3 cm. Left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed early in the second trimester. Grossly, the left ovary demonstrated an intact 7.5 cm complex cystic-solid mass, with nearly half involved by a friable, tan-yellow tumor with papillary excrescences, some of which were freely floating within the cyst cavity. Histologic sections demonstrated a struma ovarii with over 50% characterized by the classic features of a well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (Fig. ). The periphery of the tumor impinged on the ovarian capsule and vascular structures; however, no definitive evidence of invasion was seen on the histologic sections reviewed (Fig. -). Typical histology for an ovarian mature cystic teratoma (such as areas of squamous differentiation) were present in other areas of the tumor (Fig. ). The tumor expressed positive immunohistochemical staining for thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1, Fig. ), but was negative for BRAF V600E. Serum Tg was 83.5 ng/mL (reference range for euthyroid status in nonpregnant adults 0\u201335 ng/mL) seven days after surgical resection of the ovarian mass. The elevated Tg level is reasonably expected given the proximity to surgery and Tg half-life of 65 h [] and the known increase in Tg levels during pregnancy [, ]. Thyroid function tests (TSH 1.66 mU/L) and thyroid ultrasound were normal. Levothyroxine (L-T4) was started to suppress thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to 0.1\u20130.5 mU/L although TSH ranged 0.86\u20131.41 mU/L during pregnancy. After delivery, Tg was 2.9 ng/mL (TSH 0.57 mU/L). With thyroglobulin levels in a reasonable range as above, the risk of additional studies during pregnancy in terms of radiation or hypothyroid exposure, unknown risk of metastatic disease, and unknown incremental benefit of intervention during pregnancy, the decision was made to delay further testing and therapy until after delivery. Two months after delivery, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy to permit evaluation for metastatic disease and monitoring for recurrence by Tg levels. The thyroid pathology was benign.\nSeveral months after delivery and cessation of lactation, the patient underwent L-T4 withdrawal and her Tg unexpectedly rose from 0.8 ng/mL (TSH 5.8 mU/L) to 113.7 ng/mL (TSH 46 mU/L). A concurrent diagnostic I-131 scan (1 mCi) with planar and SPECT/CT imaging revealed focal central neck activity consistent with thyroid remnant and the presence of iodine-avid skeletal metastatic disease involving the left ninth rib, bilateral proximal femurs, and sacrum (Fig. -). Following 320 mCi I-131 therapy based on blood dosimetry calculations, post-therapy scan revealed the additional finding of miliary pulmonary metastases (Fig. ). Due to high-quality SPECT/CT images, separate dedicated CT and bone scan were not necessary. She was subsequently treated with TSH suppression resulting in an undetectable Tg < 0.1 ng/mL (TSH 0.02 mU/L). In order to assess the interval response to I-131 treatment, follow-up evaluation after L-T4 withdrawal protocol was obtained nine months later, demonstrating a stimulated Tg of 0.2 ng/mL (TSH 36.4 mU/L) and negative diagnostic I-131 scan without focal abnormal radioiodine uptake in the neck or skeleton. As she was planning for a second pregnancy and her pulmonary disease was not visible on the prior diagnostic I-131 scan but became apparent only on the post-therapy scan, a 100 mCi I-131 therapeutic challenge was performed to eliminate any microscopic residual disease and more accurately ascertain the treatment response. The post-therapy I-131 scan demonstrated complete resolution of pulmonary metastatic disease; however, faint residual foci of activity were demonstrated in the left ninth rib, sacrum, and left proximal femur, consistent with a partial therapeutic response in the skeleton (Fig. ). Eight months later, Tg was < 0.1 ng/mL (TSH 0.02 mU/L). The patient continues to do well, being conservatively managed with active clinical and biochemical monitoring during L-T4 suppression therapy.", "topic_list": "['mechanisms, drugs', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 79-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of abnormal murmur. She presented with a 3-months history of worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea. Physical examination revealed a soft continuous murmur at the left upper chest with basal crackles in both lungs. Chest radiography showed mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary congestion. The ECG showed regular sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemia or prior myocardial infarction.\nTransthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a mildly dilated LV with markedly dilated left atrium. The LV ejection fraction was 60% with no wall motion abnormality. There was an unusual, tubular-like structure inside the interventricular septum with a turbulent, predominantly diastolic flow on color Doppler (Fig. , arrows; Additional file ). Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a markedly dilated RCA arising from the right aortic sinus (Fig. , arrow; Additional file ), while the origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) could not be demonstrated. There was a tortuous, abnormal vessel located adjacent to the main pulmonary artery (MPA) emptying into the posteromedial aspect of the MPA. There was an accelerated, continuous flow across the stenotic ostium (asterisk, Fig. , Additional file ). Moreover, there was severe MR from a restricted posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (MV) associated with ventricular remodeling in combination with mitral annular dilatation (Fig. , Additional file ).\nCoronary angiography with a single RCA injection revealed a markedly dilated RCA (Fig. ) providing multiple intercoronary collaterals of various sizes communicating with the left coronary system (Fig. ). The LCA later opacified the MPA through a stenotic ostium (Fig. , asterisk; Additional file ), establishing the diagnostic hallmark of ALCAPA syndrome. The calculated ratio of pulmonary-systemic blood flow was 1.4, confirming a significant left-to-right shunt. Coronary computed tomography angiography clearly identified the ALCAPA with a retropulmonary ostium (Fig. and , asterisks).

{"clinical_note": "Herein, we describe the case of a 73 year-old man in good health, who developed widely disseminated sebaceous carcinoma including metastases to brain, visceral organs, lymph nodes, and bone.\nHe initially presented in late October 2016 for removal of a rapidly growing nodule in the anterior abdominal wall. Two days later he developed confusion, urinary incontinence and progressive aphasia. Emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed 4 enhancing gray-white matter junctional lesions, the two largest measured 3.8 \u00d7 3.3 cm in the right frontal lobe and 2.3 \u00d7 2.5 cm in the left frontal lobe. Two smaller enhancing lesions in the right parietal lobe measured 8 mm and 4 mm in diameter. In November 2016, he underwent craniotomy and resection of bilateral frontal lobe tumors, and he made a full neurologic recovery and went on to receive post-operative gamma knife radiosurgery to the resection cavities and the small parietal brain lesions (Fig. ).\nHis case was reviewed in melanoma tumor boards at the Masonic Cancer Clinic, University of Minnesota. Sections of tumor revealed sheets of epithelial cells with moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm and areas of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (Fig. ). Cells exhibited nuclear pleomorphism and increased mitotic activity (Fig. ), desmoplastic stromal reaction and necrosis (Fig. ). Immunohistochemical staining was positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7, and negative for S100, HMB45, Melan-A, CD45, calretinin, ERG, p40, TTF1, CDX2, and GATA3. The immunoprofile ruled out melanoma, mesothelioma, lymphoma, sarcoma with epithelioid features, and most visceral carcinomas. Microscopic examination revealed intracytoplasmic lipid vesicles (Fig. ), confirmed by diffuse membranous reactivity for adipophilin [, ] (Fig. and ). The findings supported a histopathologic diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma. Importantly, additional tumor testing confirmed high expression of PD-L1 in 100% of tumor cells (Fig. ). Commercial genomic testing using next-generation sequencing (Foundation Medicine, Massachusetts, USA) confirmed the tumor was microsatellite stable and carried a mutational burden of 17 mutations/Mb. Table also shows various somatic mutations in genes for regulatory transcription factors, DNA repair proteins, growth factor receptors, and targetable MAPK signaling proteins. Several of the affected genes have also been described in cases of sebaceous carcinoma reported in the COSMIC () database [].\nInitial staging positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed evidence of widely disseminated disease involving lung and liver, muscle, bone, and multi-compartment bulky lymphadenopathy in chest and abdomen (Fig. ). Standard chemotherapy approaches using platinum-based chemotherapy were reviewed. However, the patient and family strongly favored a less toxic therapy, considering advanced age and quality of life concerns. Given the strong rationale for use of checkpoint inhibitors in several other tumor types, moderately high tumor mutational burden (17 muts/Mb), and strong PD-L1 expression the patient opted for anti-PD1 immunotherapy. He initiated off-label treatment with pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg, every 3 weeks) in December 2016.\nFollow up PET/ CT scan 3 months after the initiation of anti-PD1 therapy revealed remarkable improvement in lymph nodes, lung, and soft tissue, however, there were multiple new and enlarging hepatic and osseous metastases initially worrisome for progression(Fig. ). After multidisciplinary review, the findings were felt consistent with pseudo-progression and immunotherapy was continued. Restaging PET/ CT obtained after 6 months of treatment showed further significant improvements in all previously noted lesions (Fig. ), with residual FDG activity seen in small mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes. To further characterize the patient\u2019s innate and adaptive immune status at the time of his near complete response, a flow cytometry study of peripheral blood was performed. Lymphocyte subset analysis showed evidence of circulating CD45RA-CD27+ central memory (CM) and effector memory (EM) T cells, and a population of mature CD16 + CD57+ NK cells (Fig. ).\nHe continued on pembrolizumab, however, after 10 months of therapy he developed severe fatigue and orthostatic hypotension requiring hospitalization. Laboratory testing showed him to have secondary adrenal insufficiency with low (< 0.7 mcg/dL) serum cortisol and low (< 11 pg/mL) ACTH levels. He began 1 mg/kg prednisone with a prolonged steroid taper, and during high dose steroid therapy pembrolizumab dosing was interrupted. In December 2017, with 12 months of follow-up, restaging PET/CT was obtained and showed new FDG avid mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes and a new hepatic and small bowel lesion (Fig. ). Biopsy of the liver lesion in January 2018 confirmed recurrent metastatic sebaceous carcinoma, and repeat immunohistochemical staining showed tumor cells continued to express high levels of PD-L1 (not shown). After discussion, the patient elected to restart immunotherapy, and he was continued on maintenance adrenal replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (10 mg/5 mg). Recent restaging studies demonstrate growth of the mediastinal metastases and a reduction in the size of the hepatic and small bowel metastases, suggestive of pseudoprogression and a durable ongoing response to pembrolizumab (Additional file ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'mechanisms, drugs', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Baseline values of Hs-Troponin T and CK-MB were 497 ng/l and 211 U/l respectively. Native coronary circulation was completely occluded at the proximal segments. Grafts angiography showed a tandem calcified lesions of SVG on distal right coronary artery (RCA) (Fig. ) and an ostial stenosis of the SVG on first obtuse marginal branch (OM1). Left internal mammary artery on the mid left anterior descending artery was patent. Ad Hoc PCI of SVG on RCA was attempted. The proximal calcified stenosis has been crossed with a 1.5 x 12 mm balloon only with the support of Guidezilla\u2122 guide extension catheter (5-in-6 Fr), however the non compliant (NC) balloon 2.5 x 15mm was unable to break the hard and calcified plaque (Fig. ). After several attempts, the procedure was interrupted with a suboptimal result (Fig. and ). An elective PCI of SVG on RCA with rotational atherectomy was performed (left radial approach, 6 French). Two runs with 1.25 mm burr (Fig. ) and 2 runs with 1.5 mm burr (Fig. ) were carried out. Then, the use of distal anchoring balloon warranted support and tracking, made as centring rail for the advance of the tip of the \u201cmother-and-child\u201d catheter into the SVG. During slow deflation of the balloon, the Guidezilla\u2122 catheter (5-in-6 Fr) was advanced distal to the proximal stenosis to be stented, thus allowing a first drug eluting stent (DES) 3.5 \u00d7 48 mm to be placed on the mid-distal segment of the graft according to a LSD technique. The same technique was applied to deploy a second DES proximally to the first one (3.5 \u00d7 28 mm on proximal segment). During both rotational atherectomy and PCI, as well as at the final angiographic control, we did not observe any sign of embolization and the procedure was successfully completed with a final TIMI III flow without complications.

The right kidney measured 13.1 cm and the left measured 15 cm (normal approximately 6 cm) []. Multiple ill-defined hypoechoic areas were seen randomly interspersed within the renal parenchyma bilaterally suggesting presence of nephrogenic rests and therefore nephroblastomatosis. It was not possible to rule out the presence of Wilms tumour within the nephrogenic rests on ultrasound. No evidence of hydronephrosis, hydroureter or free fluid was seen.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast demonstrated homogenous, diffuse, renal enlargement and loss of normal architecture with renal parenchyma replaced by homogenous low attenuating peripheral masses bilaterally (Fig. ).

{"clinical_note": "An 85-year-old Japanese man with a history of malignant melanoma of the nasal cavity presented to our department with severe thyrotoxicosis and poor blood glucose control. He had been treated for hypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto\u2019s disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin self-injection therapy before undergoing treatment of malignant melanoma. A surgical operation of his nasal cavity was done at first, followed by one of four planned cycles of nivolumab therapy. Subsequently, two courses of ipilimumab were given as standard therapy after nivolumab therapy. Two weeks later after receiving a dual course of ipilimumab as a third treatment, he presented with a fatigue, nausea, and sweating, which progressed to clinical and biochemical thyrotoxicosis. On admission to our hospital, he was febrile with a temperature of 38.0 \u00b0C, tachycardic, agitated, and acutely anxious but still conscious (restlessness). His Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14/15. His blood pressure had decreased to 70/50 mmHg.\nHis physical examination revealed a diffuse goiter without exophthalmoses. His abdomen was soft and non-tender and his skin was warm and wet. He was also diaphoretic with jugular venous distension and peripheral edema, and his chest was clinically clear. His medical history included hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto\u2019s disease, diagnosed at 62 years of age and treated with thyroid hormone replacement, as well as type 2 diabetes mellitus treated by self-injection of insulin with a good glycemic control. He had both family histories of thyroid diseases and diabetes. An electrocardiogram showed marked tachycardia with atrial fibrillation, but a chest radiograph was normal.\nThe laboratory data are shown in Table . Laboratory investigation revealed the following thyroid function results: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) below sensitivity, free triiodothyronine (FT3) 31.7 pg/ml, and free thyroxine (FT4) 3.43 ng/dl. Remarkably, his thyroglobulin was elevated to 48,000 IU/ml. TSH receptor antibody was negative, and a 99mTc-labeled thyroid scan revealed a markedly decreased uptake (Tc retention index-uptake ratio 0.0%; normal range 0.4\u20133.0). His blood glucose was markedly elevated; in which case, we needed to increase the amount of insulin to control his blood glucose. Further immunological investigation revealed normal serum levels of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody, anti-insulinoma antigen 2 (IA-2) antibody, and insulin autoantibody (IAA).\nAccording to the diagnostic criteria of the Japan Thyroid Association for thyroid storm [], he was diagnosed as having thyroid storm 1 (TS1), definite thyroid storm, since he had thyrotoxicosis, a central nervous system symptom (restlessness), fever (38 \u00b0C), GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting), and tachycardia (135 beats per minute) in atrial fibrillation. Based on the diagnostic criteria of Burch and Wartofsky for thyroid storm, he scored 60; a score higher than 45 is suggestive of thyroid storm []. Graves\u2019 disease was less likely as thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin was within the normal range, and 99mTc-scintigraphy revealed a quite low uptake. These results indicated that his diagnosis of thyroid storm was due to destructive thyroiditis.\nHis clinical course is shown in Fig. . He was treated with an intravenously administered insulin infusion and intravenously administered fluid therapy. At first, the thyroid storm was treated with orally administered potassium iodide (50 mg every 6 hours) and a short-acting beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, landiolol hydrochloride, was used at 4\u201310 \u03bcg/kg per minute to control his heart rate. The potassium iodide was aborted when he was diagnosed as having distractive thyroiditis. Prednisolone was given at 0.5\u20130.7 mg/kg per day as a treatment for irAE and thyroid storm. Although previous reports suggested the optimum dosage of prednisolone to be 1\u20132 mg/kg per day [, ], we used a lower dose due to the coexisting and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. By day 5, his tachycardia had resolved, and the landiolol hydrochloride was discontinued. On day 11, his thyroid function was found to have improved, and the amount of total insulin used to control his blood glucose was decreased. On day 25, he was found to have hypothyroidism, and so we restarted the replacement of thyroid hormone. He was discharged from our hospital on day 35 on daily maintenance insulin injection and levothyroxine sodium hydrate.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}

Her vital signs showed blood pressure of 95/64 mmHg and pulse of 70 beats/minute. There was no sign of chest wall penetrating injury. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm with QS complexes in leads V2 to V3, ST segment elevation and T-wave inversion in leads V2 to V5 (Fig. ). Laboratory tests showed cardiac Troponin I level of 19.03 ng/ml (normal range < 0.01 ng/ml). Chest computer tomography (CT) revealed no traumatic injury but demonstrated coronary artery calcifications (Fig. ). Her parents recalled a history of high fever lasting for several days at the age of 5-year-old. The patient was admitted to our hospital diagnosed of acute traumatic MI. Serum Troponin I was peaked to 20.3 ng/ml, creatine phosphokinase(CK) to 1237 U/L and CK-MB to 101 U/L 12 h after admission. Serum BNP level was normal at 85.9 pg/ml on admission. During hospitalization, serial ECG changes were consistent with an evolving MI. She had frequent ventricular premature beats on the Holter monitor. Trans-thoracic echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular size and mild anterior hypokinesis. Notably, multiple giant left anterior descending (LAD) aneurysms with diameters from 7.5 to 8.5 mm (Fig. ) and slow flow velocity were detected. To further assess CAA, we performed contrast enhanced coronary artery computer tomography angiography (CTA)with three-dimensional (3-D)reconstruction of coronary arteries. A ringed calcification in the proximal portion of LAD artery with multiple aneurysms, thrombi and occlusions were visualized (Fig. ). CTA also demonstrated multiple aneurysms with beads-on-string appearance in the LAD artery (Fig. ). Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was minimally positive (1:10) with unknown significance.

Those results did not seem to support active vasculitis, rheumatic or immunologic diseases. Based on the typical images and her childhood fever history, we recognized that the patient\u2019s underlying coronary structural abnormality was most likely originated from KD. Considering stable hemodynamic parameters and multiple giant aneurismal dilatations of LAD artery, we managed this young patient with a conservative strategy including dual anti-platelet treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel for at least 1 year, and titrations of captopril and metoprolol to prevent ventricular remodeling. At the 2-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic. ECG showed QS complex only in V2 and V3 leads and other abnormalities were resolved (Fig. ).

No surface abnormality was evident. She was prescribed two courses of amoxicillin but did not improve. She was then referred to our otorhinolaryngology department. Her medical history was unremarkable. We found no unexplained cervical lymphadenopathy, no significant systemic symptom, no malignancy, and no immunocompromise. All laboratory parameters were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the palatine tonsils did not reveal any obvious mass lesion. Axial noncontrast T1 (600/8/2 [TR/TE/NEX]) and coronal STIR MR (5700/80/1) images of the palatine tonsils showed that the right tonsil was larger than the left. No mass or abnormal T2 prolongation (suggestive of a tumor) was evident. An axial T2-weighted image (4400/100/2) and a postgadolinium T1-weighted image with fat saturation (550/8/1) also failed to reveal any mass in the right tonsil, but on postcontrast MRI, the left tonsil showed mucosal crypts with linear enhancement, while on the right side the crypts were partly obliterated by a large mass and did not display enhancement (Fig. ).\nThe patient underwent complete surgical resection of the right tonsil because of a possible malignancy. Histological examination of the specimen revealed diffuse sheets of monomorphous plasmacytoid cells with abundant, eosinophilic finely granular cytoplasm, and eccentric nuclei. Occasional binucleated and pleomorphic cells with giant nuclei and prominent nucleoli were also observed, as were mitotic figures. No amyloid deposition was apparent. Immunohistochemically, the plasma cells were diffusely immunoreactive for the \u03bb light chain (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), IgG (DAKO), and CD43 (DAKO); partially positive for epithelial membrane antigen (DAKO); but negative for the \u03ba light chain (DAKO), IgA (DAKO), IgM (DAKO), and CD20 (DAKO). Additional immunohistochemical staining showed that the cells were positive for the plasma cell markers CD138, MUM-1, and CD56. Thus, we diagnosed a plasmacytoma (Fig. ).\nA metastatic workup was performed to search for multiple myeloma/light chain disease. Laboratory testing revealed the absence of anemia, and the serum calcium, albumin, total protein, and creatinine levels were normal. The urine lacked Bence-Jones protein.

{"clinical_note": "A 29-year-old male, with a known surgical history of LRYGB 9 years ago, presented to the emergency department complaining of sharp, severe abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ). The pain began two months ago in an intermittent fashion that would occasionally radiate to his right shoulder and progressively became worse with time. The patient did not report any constipation, distension, or vomiting despite feeling nauseated during these attacks. The pain was not related to any movement or meals and it was moderately relieved by over the counter analgesia.\nTen years ago, the patient was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), through a sleep study, due to morbid obesity. He then was advised to undergo LRYGB as a treatment. He does have any other medical problems. Family history is notable for diabetes mellitus and hypertension but no history of hyperlipidemia or obesity. His body mass index (BMI) prior to the surgery was 49.3 Kg/m2. He underwent a successful LRYGB with no complications or readmissions. After the surgery for a year and a half, he followed up with his primary surgeon. During that time, he lost 75 Kg, reaching a BMI of 26.9 Kg/m2. He then was able to maintain his weight following the operation, but failed to continue to follow up for the past 2 years. In those 2 years, he gained weight, raising his BMI to 29.9 Kg/m2, after which he modified his diet to reduce his BMI to 23.9 Kg/m2. This weight reduction was achieved prior to his presentation.\nOn physical examination, the patient was afebrile with normal vital signs. Examination of his abdomen revealed moderate tenderness over the epigastrium, central abdomen, and right hypochondrium with a positive Murphy\u2019s sign. His laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, urine analysis, liver and renal function tests, were all within normal limits. An ultrasound examination revealed two gallstones and upper borderline diameter of common bile duct, raising the suspicion of biliary obstruction.\nCorrelating his investigation results with his symptoms, he was admitted and scheduled for a cholecystectomy. Formal laparoscopic cholecystectomy was carried out the next morning. During exploration, twisting of the common channel was observed, indicating an internal hernia, although the patient\u2019s complaint did not suggest internal hernia in the differential diagnosis. The internal hernia was identified but reduction was not feasible through laparoscopy. Mini midline laparotomy was subsequently done for reduction of the hernia and more detailed exploration. The hernia was through the mesenteric defect between the alimentary limb and the biliopancreatic limbs. Both limbs of the anastomosis were identified and complete reduction of the internal hernia was done, in addition to suturing of the defect found in the mesentery. No other defects were found. The small intestine\u2019s mesentery showed prominent whitish colored vessels. Whitish thick fluid was noticed, accumulating in the right paracolic gutter and in Morison\u2019s pouch. All of the fluid was then aspirated, measuring a total of 752 mL. Analysis of the fluid showed a triglyceride level of 534 mg/dL and a Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 512 U/L. A classic Blake drain 24 F was inserted into the pelvis. The patient passed an uneventful post-operative period. On Postoperative Day (POD) one, fluid collected from the drain was 440 ml, chylous in appearance, while on POD 2\u20134 the drainage was serous in appearance. The drain was removed on POD 4. The patient was discharged on POD 4 after being able to ambulate independently on his own and eat and drink with no complications.\nThe patient did not return back for his follow-up visits and when he was called by the team, he confirmed that he has no complains up to this day.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows individual\u2019s risk factors for development of condition', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Twelve weeks after induction of adalimumab therapy, clinical remission was achieved and CRP level returned to normal. Another four months later, clinical remission was still maintained and laboratory inflammation markers remained low, but the patient presented in the clinic for Cranio-Maxillo Surgery due to severe pain in the mandibular area. Examination of the oral cavity detected ulcerative lesions of the buccal-side mucosa of the right mandible (Fig. ). To rule out malignancy, a biopsy of the oral lesions was obtained and revealed ulcerative stomatitis with noncaseating granulomas consistent with oral CD (Fig. ). Intensification of immunosuppressive therapy was initiated by shortening the adalimumab administration interval to weekly administration.

{"clinical_note": "An 80-year-old man with known cervical canal stenosis due to ossification of the cervical posterior longitudinal ligament was transferred to an emergency room soon after a falling accident. The patient was alert and had complete tetraplegia, sensory deficits below the C4 cervical sensory level, and progressive restrictive respiratory failure that required assisted ventilation, and, eventually, a tracheostomy. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging showed cervical cord compression that was worse at the C3\u2013C4 intervertebral level, and an intramedullary high signal at C3 and C4 vertebral levels, and the patient was managed conservatively. During the conventional weaning process of trials of intermittent spontaneous breathing in the ICU, an unexpected cardiac arrest made both the patient and medical staff reluctant to proceed with further weaning. Fifty-eight days after cervical cord injury, the patient was transferred to our hospital for further rehabilitation. He was fully conscious and received pressure-support mechanical ventilation with back-up rates of 16 breaths. He had total tetraplegia below shoulder girdle muscles with a preserved sensation from C2 to C3 on both sides, and a urinary obstruction. The limbs and trunk were stiff with contracture, and muscle stretch reflexes of the limbs were abolished. Neurological level of injury was C3 according to the ISNCSCI, with a total sensory score of four. There was no sensory sacral sparing, while the deep anal pressure was preserved, and the American Spinal Injury Association scale graded B. Chest roentgenogram and computerized tomography showed bilateral, widespread atelectasis. The patient occasionally showed signs of pulmonary infection. Intensive pulmonary care and rehabilitation, including physical support for expectoration, mechanically assisted removal of tracheal secretions (CoughAssist E70\u00ae, Philips Japan, Tokyo), ventilator muscle training, and management of the spasticity of the abdominal wall, resulted in the improvement of the roentgenological findings. His expiratory tidal volume (VT) measured 150 mL.\nAlthough the neurological status according to the ISNCSCI was unchanged, the patient was willing to be weaned from mechanical ventilation as his general condition improved. After informed consent was given, we attempted automated weaning from mechanical ventilation using IntelliVent\u00ae-ASV on and after 131 days of injury. IntelliVent\u00ae-ASV (Hamilton Medical AG, Switzerland) is a closed-loop ventilation mode that adjusts the pressure support in terms of the percentage of the ideal minute volume (%MV). The ideal MV (100%MV) is calculated from the patient\u2019s height and gender. Based on Otis\u2019 equation [], adaptive support ventilation will select the best VT\u2013respiratory rate (RR) coupling for the optimal work of breathing. IntelliVent\u00ae-ASV has interrelated functions: an auto-adjustment for carbon dioxide (CO2) elimination, an auto-adjustment for oxygenation, an auto-weaning tool named Quick Wean (QW), and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The setting of the target %MV is automated based on either the monitored end-tidal CO2 or monitored spontaneous breathing rate. The auto adjustment of fraction of inspiratory oxygen or positive end-expiratory pressure is based on the monitored oxygen saturation fraction of hemoglobin with a pulse oximeter (SpO2) []. The QW mode is an optional automated weaning, and progressively reduces the pressure support, monitors for readiness-to-wean criteria, and provides the option to automatically conduct a fully controlled SBT. In the QW mode, when the spontaneous rate is less than the upper limit of the predicted target range, %MV is automatically decreased gradually to the selected level. To facilitate the recovery of VT by means of the loading work on respiratory muscles, we set the level of support to 70%MV for the QW mode. When spontaneous breathing satisfied the pre-determined conditions of oxygenation and ventilation for 1 min, the SBT mode was used. We operated the SBT mode during the day from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.\nIn the QW mode, the duration of 70%MV and SBT time (25%MV) increased gradually (Figs. and ). Twenty-two days after the introduction of the QW and SBT modes in association with intensive pulmonary rehabilitation, SBT was running almost fully during the daytime. At this time, the expiratory VT was increased to 350 mL from 150 mL upon admission to our hospital. Thereafter, we withdrew the pressure support ventilation during the nighttime 39 days after the introduction of the auto-weaning mode, and the patient\u2019s weaning process was completed.", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

On the second fall, the patient had hit his right shoulder, cheek, and foot, prompting the visit. The patient had received a colonoscopy earlier in the day for routine cancer screening. He had followed proper protocol regarding his bowel prep and had not had any immediate complications related to the procedure or anesthesia. Since the colonoscopy, he had continuous bouts of cramping abdominal pain. He had also felt dizzy throughout this period but attributed it to dehydration related to his bowel prep. The patient denied striking his head, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or blood in his stools. His past medical history was significant for coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. The patient took his benazepril, aspirin, and atorvastatin on the day prior to colonoscopy.\nOn physical exam, the patient was afebrile with a heart rate of 87 and blood pressure of 130/78. The patient's head, neck, chest, and neurological exams were entirely normal. His abdominal exam was remarkable for tenderness in the right and left lower quadrant with some voluntary guarding, but no masses or rebound was appreciated. His orthopedic exam demonstrated tenderness to his right acromioclavicular joint and ecchymosis of his right 5th metatarsal with no deformity and normal range of motion at all joints.\nOn laboratory evaluation, the patient's hemoglobin was 12.4 g/dL, with normal platelets and chemistry studies. Head computed tomography (CT) and shoulder and chest radiography were normal. Foot radiography demonstrated a nondisplaced 5th metatarsal fracture. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated moderate hemoperitoneum with splenic laceration (Figures , , and ).\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent serial abdominal exams and every four-hour hemoglobin measurements. His hemoglobin fell to 8 g/dL at 48 hours after admission but subsequently stabilized.

She was diagnosed as having CIPA because of recurrent episodes of unexplained fever, anhidrosis, burns, and bone fractures after birth. She had previously undergone 7 operations for spinal deformity and 1 operation of total hip arthroplasty in both the left and right sides. Although lack of general diaphoresis and thermal nociception were observed, the patient performed body surface cooling at her own discretion when she felt she was at a risk of hyperthermia, and her body temperature was kept approximately 36\u00b0C. No signs of mental retardation or orthostatic hypotension were observed. No abnormality was detected on chest radiographs and electrocardiograms. Blood biochemistry revealed no abnormality except mild anemia indicated by a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dl.\nNo premedication was administered. After the patient was brought into the operating room, routine monitoring and measurement of the bispectral index (BIS) were started. Body temperature was measured at 3 different sites (urinary bladder, esophagus, and precordial skin) and controlled by a hot-air-type heater. Propofol was administered at an effect-site concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml by target-controlled infusion. After muscle relaxation had been achieved by administration of 50 mg of rocuronium, the trachea was intubated. Immediately after endotracheal intubation, systolic blood pressure increased from 130 to 145 mmHg, and heart rate increased from 60 to 95 beats per minute (bpm). Two minutes later, systolic blood pressure had decreased to 125 mmHg. Propofol was continuously infused intravenously at a target concentration of 2 to 4 \u03bcg/ml () and BIS levels were maintained between 40 and 60. After an arterial catheter had been placed, her position was changed from the supine to right lateral position. Surgery was then started.\nSince no circulatory change associated with pain occurred during surgery, opioids were not administered. Regarding hemodynamics, when 600 ml of blood was rapidly lost within 20 minutes, blood pressure decreased from 113/66 to 93/55 mmHg and heart rate increased from 55 to 70 bpm ( a). Similarly, when 850 ml of blood was lost within 30 minutes, systolic blood pressure decreased from 108/65 to 95/60 mmHg and heart rate increased from 66 to 74 bpm ( b). Administration of 0.1 mg of phenylephrine increased blood pressure from 87/55 to 117/76 mmHg and decreased heart rate from 70 to 65 bpm ( c).\nThe operative time was 6 hours and 49 minutes, and the duration of anesthesia was 8 hours and 41 minutes. The volume of blood loss was 3350 ml. Blood transfusion was performed with 1600 ml of preoperatively donated autologous blood, 900 ml of salvaged blood, and 720 ml of fresh frozen plasma. Intraoperative body temperature was controlled and kept between 36.0\u00b0C and 36.9\u00b0C at all 3 measurement points. After surgery had been completed, the patient was returned to the supine position and she was extubated. Since she did not complain of any pain after the surgery, no analgesic was administered. She was discharged at 6 weeks after the operation.\nBlood samples were collected 3 times: before anesthesia induction, after the start of surgery, and at the end of surgery.

The pelvic computed tomography (CT) revealed a 9x7.5x9 cm bulky mass in the sacrum with locally increased soft tissue density, causing extensive lytic lesions of the sacred vertebrae and extending to the left iliac bone, suggestive of chordoma. The patient underwent total sacrectomy with partial excision and reconstruction of the left iliac bone. The anatomopathological examination revealed sacrococcygeal involvement by a thyroid carcinoma, as verified by immunohistochemical staining for thyroglobulin and TTF-1, predominantly papillary (follicular variant), however with foci of nondifferentiated (insular) carcinoma (Figures and ). Thyroid ultrasonography showed a solid nodule of 20 mm in the right lobe and two solid hypoechogenic nodules of 11 and 9 mm in the left lobe, the smallest with coarse calcifications.

Recovery from surgery went well, and the patient had a residual left-sided weakness and was able to ambulate by using a walker at discharge. At presentation to the emergency department, the patient had 2 episodes of unprovoked syncope with nausea, somnolence, and worsening of his left-sided weakness.

{"clinical_note": "A 48-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, visited the internal medicine department at another hospital with a complaint of abdominal fullness and weight loss of 10kg during the last year. A huge abdominal mass was palpated, and she was referred to the gynecology department to search for a tumor of uterine origin. She was premenopausal and had no significant past medical history. Physical findings revealed a large elastic hard mass extending from the xiphoid to the pubic bone. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed a huge tumor on the uterine corpus, and a number of dilated vessels were observed between the tumor and the myometrium. Therefore, the tumor was suspected to derive from the uterus. The tumor showed an uneven signal on T2-weighted sagittal section (), and the enhanced MRI study showed that the tumor edge but not the center was enhanced (). As such, necrosis was suspected to have occurred in the center of the tumor. Uterine sarcoma was primarily suspected due to the large size, degeneration, and necrosis on MRI imaging. Computed tomography (CT) examination showed no lymph node swelling or distant metastasis. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.6g/dl). We transfused 18 units of RCC before surgery. CT examination and ultrasonography on lower extremities indicated an absence of thrombosis. Preoperative serum levels of CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, and LDH were within normal limits. A biopsy of the endometrium was not collected as the sounding examination of the endometrium was unsuccessful due to a deviated uterine cervix. At this point, preoperatively, we suspected the tumor was a leiomyosarcoma or leiomyoma with degeneration.\nThe patient underwent laparotomy, where we identified a huge tumor occupying a space from the pelvis to the diaphragm. The tumor surface was smooth and hard with many dilated veins (). A massive tumor with a diameter of 30 cm was observed arising from the posterior uterine wall with a smooth contour and invaded the retroperitoneal cavity under the mesentery. The tumor was firmly adhered to both the mesentery and right ovary. There were no findings of extra-uterine dissemination. The intraoperative frozen section report for the uterine tumor was of degenerated myoma with no findings indicating malignancy. A total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and right salpingo-oophorectomy (RSO) were performed. The operation duration and blood loss were approximately 216 minutes and 1000 ml, respectively. The excised specimen weighed 7600 g.\nMacroscopic findings of the tumor revealed a well-circumscribed tumor showing extensive continuity with the posterior wall of the uterus, measuring 28 \u00d7 23 cm (). On the sliced surface of the tumor, an obvious heterogeneous pattern was recognized within the mixture of a whitish homogeneous area, suggesting benign uterine fibroids, and a vulnerable area, due to bleeding and necrosis ().\nFor the intraoperative frozen section, we examined three areas, namely, a white homogenous part, a necrotic part, and a cystic part, of which all were findings of a leiomyoma. In the permanent histological examination, 10 additional sections were collected from the tumor. The basic histological findings of all the sections were the same. The tumor was comprised of spindle-shaped cells, homologous to smooth muscle cells, which were arranged in bundles with areas of hyalinization, consistent with a degenerated leiomyoma. The tumor was mostly comprised of degenerated uterine leiomyoma. However, enlarged blood vessels were observed within an area of approximately 2 cm \u00d7 several mm, and proliferation of atypical cells showing a fine meshwork microvascular structure was observed in the blood vessel cavity (). These atypical cells consisted of various contours, such as cubic, polygonal, and short spindle shape. The nucleus was circular with a high degree of vacuolar enlargement and pleomorphism. Abnormal mitotic figures were also interspersed (). A tumor derived from a blood vessel was thus considered, and malignancy was suggested by the presence of nuclear atypia and abnormal mitosis.\nImmunohistochemical analysis revealed the atypical tumor cells to be positive for ERG, CD31, and AE1/3 (Figures and ), partially positive for Factor VIII, and negative for \u03b1-SMA, desmin, H-caldesmon, EMA, CD34, and D2-40. From the above, the atypical tumor cells were of epithelial origin and the final diagnosis was epithelioid angiosarcoma arising in a degenerated uterine leiomyoma.\nThe efficacy of postoperative adjuvant therapy for angiosarcoma has not been demonstrated and there is currently no established chemotherapy regimen. In this case, because the atypical tumor was observed in the blood vessel cavity, we thought it could have been spread hematogenously throughout the body. Hence, we selected adjuvant chemotherapy rather than adjuvant radiotherapy. Six courses of combination adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel (150mg/m2), epirubicin (50mg/m2), and carboplatin (area under the curve = 4) were administered in the present case, following referral to previous reported cases.

He was prescribed oral erythromycin (160mg, twice a day), chloramphenicol ointment (1%, three times a day) for both eyes, and topical fluorometholone (0.1%, twice a day) for the left eye.\nReview two weeks later showed progressive corneal neovascularization and infiltrate. Due to the progression despite conventional treatment and to aid compliance with the treatment, the decision was made for subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide and bevacizumab, with regular EUA for treatment and monitoring of progress and side effects. Two weeks later, he received subconjunctival triamcinolone (4mg/0.1mL \u00d7 0.55mL) to the inferior conjunctiva and subconjunctival bevacizumab (2.5mg/0.1mL \u00d7 0.05mL) to the superior conjunctiva of the right eye. Extensive lid hygiene including 5% povidone-iodine lid scrubs and Meibomian gland expression was performed, and this was repeated at subsequent EUA. Intraocular pressures (IOP) by iCare\u00ae tonometer (iCare Finland) were 14mmHg in each eye. He continued on the same medication regimen and SteriLid (TheraTears\u00ae) two to three times per week.\nSix weeks after the injections, the mother of Twin 1 reported significant improvement in his symptoms. At EUA eight weeks after the injections, the right cornea looked markedly improved (Figures -). IOPs were 12mmHg in the right and 6mmHg in the left eye. Given that there had been dramatic improvement with no significant side effects observed, he was continued on the same regimen and the left eye was injected with the same dose of triamcinolone and bevacizumab.\nAt EUA 11 weeks after the left eye injections, there was quiescent interstitial keratitis. Adjunctive diathermy was applied to the patent superior and inferior feeder vessels in the left eye. Further subconjunctival triamcinolone (4mg/0.1mL \u00d7 0.5mL) was injected inferiorly in each eye. Binocular BCVA (due to objection to occlusion) was 20/63.\nAt EUA 5 months after the further bilateral triamcinolone injections, there was central corneal scarring and suppressed blood vessels bilaterally (Figures -). Diathermy was applied at the limbus to further feeder vessels of each eye. IOP was 16mmHg in the right and 19mmHg in the left eye. Binocular BCVA (due to objection to occlusion) 24 months after presentation was 20/63.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

The mass started out as a small bump and had grown steadily since then. 3 months prior to his presentation, a draining parulis developed on the mass. The patient had no history of systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, weight loss, or fatigue. He was aware of a dark-colored \u201cdead tooth\u201d for several decades in the area of concern but denied any previous history of swelling in the area. The patient had recently moved to the United States from Nigeria and had previously been without access to adequate dental care. The patient said that a doctor in Nigeria told him that the lesion was likely cancerous.\nOn exam, there was a large, painless, fibrous, exophytic mass in the anterior maxillary labial vestibule (Figures and ). The base of the mass approximated the apex of tooth #8. A yellow purulent material was observed draining from the parulis (). Tooth #8 was discolored and was confirmed to be nonvital on pulp testing. There was a significant gap between teeth #7 and 8. Tooth #8 was displaced medially and was extruded relative to the adjacent dentition.\nA periapical radiograph revealed a large unilocular radiolucency associated with the apex of tooth #8 (). Cone-beam computed tomography again demonstrated a large cystic-appearing defect in the anterior maxilla with perforation of the buccal and palatal cortices . The lesion extended to the nasal floor on the ipsilateral side.\nThe patient was referred to the oral surgery department for excisional biopsy. After tooth #8 was removed, an incision was made around the base of the stalk that connected the mass to the labial and alveolar mucosa. Sharp dissection was used to free the mass, and the specimen was sent for histopathologic analysis. The mass communicated with a cystic lesion of the maxilla. The cyst was enucleated with a curette and also sent for pathology. Perforation of the cyst through the buccal and palatal cortices was noted during the procedure. Slight undermining of the wound margins allowed for closure with resorbable sutures.\nAt the patient's one-week follow-up (), he was doing very well. He reported minimal pain, no neurosensory disturbances, and no systemic or local symptoms of infection. He and his family were very relieved to learn that the lesion was benign.

The patient described constant back pain almost daily for which she took ibuprofen with moderate relief. These symptoms began three years ago following a sexual assault and have progressed significantly. As per the patient's mother, the only time the patient's spine straightened out was during deep sleep. She had no neurologic complaints, specifically denying any sensory or motor deficits, fatigue, ptosis, or any complaints consistent with any form of endocrinopathy. Her family history included siblings with epilepsy, ADHD, and mood disorders.\nThe patient denied any substance abuse, including use of alcohol or cigarettes, as well as being sexually active. She reported no history of mood or psychotic symptoms and no suicide attempts.\nDespite the pain, however, the patient was not concerned with her condition. The patient herself was not interested in physical therapy or additional diagnostic testing or counseling despite her mother's encouragement. She refused a gynecological examination due to anxiety following having been a victim of sexual assault; it was unclear the extent of counseling, if any, she received following the assault.\nThe patient was a seventh grader at a local school where she participated in extracurricular activities. She reported being well accepted by her peers. She stated having a good social support network including friends and family. Her parents were separated and she lived with her mother and brother.\nPhysical exam revealed an obese (BMI 39.2) Caucasian female, leaning forward with the spine nearly ninety degrees at the waist. Extremities showed normal strength, sensation, and range of motion. The patient was unwilling to attempt spinal extension. Tenderness to palpation of the paraspinal muscles was present.

{"clinical_note": "A 28-year-old female with insignificant past medico surgical history presented with one day of acute onset pain in the periumbilical region that later migrated and confined to the RIF. She had associated intermittent fever, nausea, and loss of appetite. She did not have any urinary symptoms, bowel irregularities, or gynecological complaints. Abdominal examination was performed by two senior surgeons at two different occasions; the same day had findings of guarding and rebound tenderness at RIF. Hematological tests showed polymorphonuclear leukocytosis with left shift. Biochemical tests and urinalysis were normal. Urinary pregnancy test was negative. Abdominal radiographs were unremarkable. USG could not visualize appendix and was inconclusive except for probe tenderness in RIF. CT scan of the abdomen could not be done due to unavailability. A clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made assigning an Alvarado score of 9/10. Laparotomy was performed using the Lanz incision in RIF. Intraoperatively appendix was found to be normal without evidence of inflammation or infection in RIF. In view of symptoms and signs, a possibility of other pathology was thought. Walking the bowel proximally up to 3 feet (1 m) did not show a Meckel's diverticulum or any other small bowel lesions. There were no obvious mesenteric lymph nodal enlargement and pelvic organs looked pristine. Approaching closure, just when the medial edge of the incision was retracted superomedially, a hemorrhagic lesion seemed to appear little deeper in the mid abdomen. Therefore, the incision was extended transversely from the medial edge to explore further. Entire bowel was explored and this revealed an ulcerated lesion measuring 7 \u00d7 5 cm arising from the antimesenteric border of the ileum 8 feet (2.5 m) from ICJ with localized interloop hemoperitoneum and inflammatory exudates as shown in . Resection of ileal segment containing the lesion was performed followed by restoration of bowel continuity and peritoneal toileting. The lesion was subsequently reported to be an ulcerated malignant ileal GIST.\nHistopathologically, gross examination confirmed the operative findings, and the cut section revealed a nodular lesion protruding out of the serosal surface measuring 7 \u00d7 5 cm along with 2 lymph nodes each measuring 2 \u00d7 1 cm.\nMicroscopically, the growth from the ileum had villous lining epithelium with focal ulceration. The submucosal region had a circumscribed nodule with proliferation of loosely cohesive spindle cells; some of which were arranged in vague storiform pattern and others in long fascicles. There were areas with epitheloid cells forming small anastomosing nests and cords. The areas in between these showed skenoid fibers along with focal areas of hemorrhage, infarction, and congestion as shown in . The mitotic figures were seen (8/50 high-power field). The lymph nodes were microscopically identified to be reactive, and the resected margins of the ileum were free of tumor.\nBased on tumor size and mitotic activity, possibility of a malignant GIST was suggested along with immunohistochemical analysis (CD117 and CD34) for further confirmation. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the 8th postoperative day. She was advised to review a week later at the outpatients but failed to report.

The mass, measuring 2.0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 1.3 cm, was subsequently excised.\nHistologic examination revealed a clear cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for CD10, PAX-8, and carbonic anhydrase 9/IX (CA-IX) and negative for CK7. A diagnosis of metastatic CCRCC was made (). Radiological studies then revealed a left renal mass, bilateral adrenal masses, and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. A subsequent left radical nephrectomy and adrenalectomy was performed. On gross examination, a unifocal tumor that measured 14.7 cm in its greatest dimension was identified. Pathologic examination confirmed the renal origin of the vaginal carcinoma. The nephrectomy diagnosis was established as CCRCC with rhabdoid differentiation and multinucleated giant tumor cells. The World Health Organization (WHO)/International Society of Urologic Pathologists (ISUP) grade was 4. The tumor invaded into the perinephric fat tissue, renal sinus, and major branches of the renal vein. Tumor necrosis and lymphovascular invasion were identified. All margins, including Gerota's fascia, ureteral and vascular, were free of malignancy. The left adrenal gland was involved with metastatic CCRCC. The final pathological stage was pT3a pNx pM1.\nMultiple pulmonary nodules, measuring up to 4 mm, and a right adrenal nodule were observed on imaging. The patient is now receiving adjuvant targeted therapy (Sunitinib 50 mg). The lung nodules are no longer seen, and the right adrenal nodule had decreased more than 30% in size. Interestingly, her vaginal mass recurred, increased in size, and changed in shape since her last resection. She, thus, underwent a partial excision of the new lesion on the vaginal wall.

Based on data given by the passing eyewitness, the teenager jumped into the river to retrieve a sheep he was tending but immediately disappeared from the water surface. This youth of the same age promptly dived into the river, found the victim's body on the bottom at a depth of 2 metres, raised him, and swam to the shore, which was about 3 metres away. Based on the rescuer's statement, the drowning boy was unconscious, was not breathing, had blue lips and nail pates, and had very cold skin. Due to knowledge about First Aid acquired in high school, the rescuer started measures for basic life support (BLS (Basic Life Support)), freed the airway, performed several mouth to mouth breaths, and started chest compression. After 2-3 minutes the victim vomited, threw up water, coughed, and started breathing. In the next few minutes he regained consciousness. In the meantime, members of his family had been called and they brought the patient to our institution in a private vehicle.\nAt arrival he was somnolent, oriented, anxious, and pale, with tachypnea (number of respirations 30/min), with hypothermic-body temperature 35.1\u00b0C, shivering (whole body), and with the subjective sensation of cold. He was admitted to the JIT and the following was monitored: ECG TA, pulse, body temperature, and pulse oximetry. A nasogastric tube and a urinary catheter were placed. Auscultation of both lungs revealed weakened breathing sounds, especially in the basal and middle parts, with many early and late inspirium cracklings and low tone whistling. Cardiac action was arrhythmic accompanied by tachycardia up to 120/min, BP (blood pressure) 100/55 mmHg. There were no signs of neurological deficit or lateralization, GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) 13/15.\nUsing transcutaneous pulse oximetry at admission we measured the following: O2 saturation, which was 80% (during the course of treatment it normalized); pH 7.32; O2 54.8 mm Hg; CO2 55 mm Hg; BE\u20141.60 mmol/L; C-reacting protein 96 mg/L; Er 5.11 \u00d7 1012/L; Hb 136 g/L; Le 14.3 \u00d7 109/L; glycemia 4.0 mmol/L. Chest radiography showed spotty shadows in the middle and inferior lobes with free costodiaphragmatic recess sinuses bilaterally.\nThe ECG at arrival indicated an irregular rhythm, HR (heart rate) 120/min with short-term atrial fibrillation that later corrected spontaneously into normal sinus rhythm.\nImmediately upon admission we continued reanimation. The patient was warmed up with thermal blankets. Oxygen therapy was applied using an oxygen mask with reservoir without rebreathing, at a flow rate of 8 l/min, decreasing to 6 l/min in order to maintain SpO2 \u2265 94%. Parenteral antibiotic therapy (III generation cephalosporin, aminoglycosides, and metronidazole) and parenteral rehydration were administered.\nOn the fifth day after admission the patient showed complete recovery, including withdrawal of the chest radiographic symptoms and no pathological signs were visible on physical examination of the lungs.\nHowever, during each attempt to get up, we registered atrial fibrillation or individual SVES (supraventricular extrasystole) and VES (ventricular extrasystole) triplets. On echocardiographic examination the structure of the left ventricular myocardium was hyperechogenic; echocardiography was performed with slightly restricted LVEF\nDuring halter ECG examination we registered multiple strings of VES triplets, frequency 150 per minute.

Two weeks later, he started having pain in his knees, elbows, shoulders, and neck. The patient was diagnosed with influenza and completed a course of oseltamivir. His joint pain and intermittent fever persisted. He began to develop malaise, weakness, and difficulty waking and was noted to have cough. During the next month, the patient was evaluated twice in different emergency departments with the same complaints. Evaluation at the emergency department revealed a mildly elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Chest X-ray findings were consistent with pneumonia, and he was prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Three weeks later, the patient presented to his pediatrician with complaints of bilateral ear pain. His fevers, joint pain, difficulty walking, and fatigue persisted. During physical examination, the pediatrician noted a new systolic murmur.

Her vital signs upon arrival to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) were temperature of 98.1\u00b0 Fahrenheit, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 26/min, blood pressure 140/81 mm of Hg, and 100% oxygen saturations without supplemental oxygen. Her capillary refill time was 4-5 seconds. Her weight was 57 kg. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 13 in the ER, which improved to 15 upon arrival to PICU. Skin rash with infected lesions was noted in her groin. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.\nWorkup in the ER showed hyperglycemia of 472 mg/dL, metabolic acidosis (pH 6.75, pCO2 18.4, pO2 149, HCO3 2.5, base deficit 32.6, anion gap 23.5), ketosis (beta-hydroxybutyrate 11.41), glucosuria, and ketonuria, which were consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis. Her white cell counts were 22.3 k/L, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, and hematocrit 47%. The rest of her workup was unremarkable.\nThe patient received fluid resuscitation with 30 mL/kg of 0.9% normal saline (NS) and 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate in the ER. Continuous insulin infusion was started at 0.1 unit/kg/hr. After that she was started on intravenous fluids containing 0.45% saline and 75 mEq/L of sodium bicarbonate. This was administered at 150 mL/hr, which was 1.25 times the usual daily maintenance requirement for her weight. A consultation with our PICU was obtained at this stage. No further bicarbonate boluses were given. Her fluids were changed to isotonic fluid with potassium phosphate and potassium chloride and without any bicarbonate. It was administered at the rate of 1.5 times maintenance of daily requirement for weight. She was transferred to the PICU at this stage, where she continued to exhibit severe metabolic acidosis with pH 6.97, pCO2 26.7, HCO3 6.1, and base deficit of 24.5. The DKA management was continued with close monitoring and serial laboratory evaluations.\nAfter few hours of her arrival in the PICU, the patient became disoriented and confused. She was given one time 5 ml/kg of 3% hypertonic saline (HS) due to concern for cerebral edema and she responded well. Four hours later she developed lethargy followed by apnea. She was given additional doses of 3% HS bolus (5 mL/kg) and 0.8 g/kg of 20% mannitol. The hyperosmolar therapy was effective but only transiently; the patient eventually required intubation and mechanical ventilation for recurrent apnea.\nCT head obtained at that time showed a thin, right parietal subdural hemorrhage without any evidence of edema or mass effect. Of note, CT scan was obtained after the initiation of hyperosmolar therapy.\nHyperosmolar therapy was continued afterwards with 3% HS and 20% mannitol. It was guided with close monitoring of renal function including serum sodium and serum osmolarity. The doses and other parameters were maintained per standard of care [, ].\nThe patient's serum sodium was 135 upon arrival in the ER and 143 at around 11 hrs before the initiation of hyperosmolar therapy and reached to 160 at 71 hrs when hyperosmolar therapy was discontinued. It was normalized to 143 at 131 hrs of admission. Her osmolarity was 298, 305, 335, and 299 at those timings (sodium in mmol/L and osmolarity in msom/kg). The rate of glucose reduction was < 50 mg/dl/hr.\nMRI brain obtained at 60 hrs of admission showed mild edema of the cortex and sulci and diffuse edema of the pons and midbrain with restricted diffusion in the pons consistent with central pontine myelinolysis also known as osmotic demyelination syndrome. There was no significant change in the subdural hemorrhage (Figures \u2013). MR angiogram showed no evidence of vessel abnormality.\nThe patient required continued mechanical ventilation and further management in the PICU. She became more responsive on day 5, and her support was gradually weaned until extubation on day 7. At that time she exhibited only mild residual dysmetria, trivial ataxia, mild left sided weakness, and neglect. All deficits subsequently improved.\nHer course was complicated by an isolated focal seizure that responded to standard antiepileptic medication. She also developed bilateral upper extremity deep venous thromboses (DVT). Hematology workup showed no underlying hypercoagulability. Thus the DVT was considered as another complication of DKA [\u2013].\nHer overall hospital length of stay was 14 days, and by the date of discharge she was able to ambulate with a walker and speak and eat without difficulty.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}

{"clinical_note": "A 49-year-old Japanese woman underwent an MRI examination in the referring hospital for an assessment of the orthopedic disease of her right hip joint, and the MRI revealed a tumor in her pelvis. She was referred to our hospital, where an MRI examination again showed tumor mobility (Fig. ), and a tumor derived from the intestinal tract was suspected.\nIn the contrast CT image (Fig. ), a mass approx. 45 mm in size was found on the right side of the pelvic floor, and in the blood vessel construction image, the tumor was nourished by vessels from the splenic artery to the greater omentum. In 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT), no abnormal accumulation was observed (Fig. ). The results of complete blood cell counts and biochemical tests were all normal. Cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) showed a mild elevation at 37.8 U/mL (normal range < 37.0 U/mL), and carcinogenic embryonic antigen (CEA) was normal at 0.8 ng/mL (normal range < 5.0 ng/mL). Based on all of these results, the preoperative diagnosis was a suspected omental primary tumor or accessory spleen.\nThere was a danger of torsion irrespective of the presence or absence of malignancy, and the patient desires surgery to remove the tumor; the surgery was conducted concurrently with the diagnosis and treatment. The surgery was a single-incision laparoscopic-assisted greater omental tumor resection. A longitudinal incision was made approx. 4 cm around the umbilicus. A multichannel port (x-Gate\u00ae, Sumitomo Bakelite, Tokyo) was inserted in the wound. Observation of the abdominal cavity revealed a red and solid tumor mass of approx. 4 cm. Adhesion with the surrounding tissue was not observed. The greater omentum and the tumor were guided out of the body through the gate hole (Fig. ), and the tumor was excised together with the greater omentum. The tumor, a light brown tinged solid mass with a smooth border, was 5.2 \u00d7 3.8 \u00d7 3.5 cm in size with a well-defined border (Fig. ).\nHistopathologically, the tumor involved large and small blood vessels (Fig. ), and tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm were increased in number, in sheet form (Fig. ). In immunohistochemical staining, the tumor cells were found to be positive for HMB45 (Fig. ), Melan-A (Fig. ), and \u03b1-SMA (Fig. ), but negative for CD34, Desmin, c-kit, and s-100.\nBased on the above results, the tumor was diagnosed as an omental PEComa.

He had an EGD at an outside facility 2 years earlier for evaluation of abdominal pain which showed a 1.2 cm duodenal polypoid lesion in the second portion of the duodenum. Pathology of the polyp revealed heterotopic gastric mucosa with benign lobules of gastric glands. He also was found to have chronically active H. pylori gastritis with numerous Helicobacter organisms and atrophic gastritis with patchy areas of intestinal metaplasia. At that time, he was instructed to follow up for a repeat endoscopy for surveillance in two years. As recommended, two years later he presented to our office for surveillance of his duodenal lesion. Due to his history of atrophic gastritis and a large duodenal lesion, we performed an upper endoscopy that showed atrophic gastritis, duodenitis, and a single 10 mm polyp in the second portion of the duodenum. The duodenal polyp was biopsied. Pathology revealed polypoid gastric metaplastic mucosa with focal epithelial atypia including nuclear enlargement, stratification, nucleoli, and few mitoses. The patient was referred for endoscopic ultrasound to further characterize the lesion and complete resection. Several weeks later he underwent an endoscopic ultrasound that revealed a 13-mm pedunculated and sessile polyp on the lateral wall opposite to the major papilla in the second portion of the duodenum ().

{"clinical_note": "A 25-year-old gentleman presented to our clinic with a complaint of recurrent pain and swelling on his right cheek of three-month duration. He visited a general practitioner each time, and the condition was resolved with analgesic and antibiotics. However, his symptoms got worse and he attended our Oral Surgery Clinic for consultation.\nThe patient is a fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history and no known history of allergy. Past surgical history revealed that he had underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery one and half year earlier in a local hospital. Although the postoperative period was uneventful, the surgical team informed him that there was a dislodged orthodontic appliance in his right cheek that must have occurred during the operation. The team explained to the patient that this accident was realized later on the next day after the surgery when the molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing, and its presence was confirmed high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area shown in the postoperative X-ray image taken on the next day following the surgery. A series of further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location, lying outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to the pronounced postoperative facial oedema at that time, no attempt was made to remove the appliance. The absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions confirmed the decision to leave it in-situ with continuous clinical observation.\nOn examination, there was no extraoral swelling noted. The mandible and maxilla seemed firm indicating good healing following previous mandibular saggital split and maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy sites and a stable class I dental occlusion. Intraorally, there was a sinus with slight pus discharge on the upper right buccal sulcus region adjacent to the upper right first premolar. All teeth in that quadrant were firm and vital. Tenderness was elicited upon palpation on the upper right vestibular region. We suspected the sinus track may originate from the dislodged appliance embedded in the cheek soft tissue. A periapical view was then taken with gutta-percha inserted into the sinus for foreign body localization purpose. The radiograph revealed the gutta-percha pointed towards the site of titanium plate and screws placed used for rigid fixation, and with the molar orthodontic tube appliance in its vicinity (). A cone beam CT was performed to provide a 3D detailed location of the appliance (Figures and ) and confirmed it to be located outside the maxillary antrum.\nThe presence of the molar orthodontic tube foreign body reaction was suspected as the most probable cause of the recurrent right cheek pain and swelling associated with an intraoral discharging sinus. Exploration of the site was performed through the sulcular incision under general anesthesia. The dislodged molar tube was identified lying on the zygomatic bone just beneath the raised flap. It was removed by dividing some surrounding fibrous tissue strands. Just below it, one titanium straight bone plate with four screws used for fixing the previous Le Fort I osteotomy site was inspected and found to be rigidly embedded in normal bone. However, a decision was made to remove them based on the fact that they are present in an infected area. (). The Le Fort I osteotomy site showed good healing with new bone formation. Patient had an uneventful recovery thereafter, and the orthognathic surgical team who attended him previously was informed of his progress.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}

The patient was previously misdiagnosed with epilepsy in another hospital, but no abnormal findings were detected on a 24-h electroencephalogram at our hospital. Her abdominal perfusion CT showed a highly perfused nodule within the pancreatic tail; A magnetic resonance scan confirmed the location of this nodule and indicated that its size was 11.6 \u00d7 13.2 mm (Fig. -). Additionally, 68Ga-exendin 4 PET-CT showed a region in the pancreatic tail with abnormally high metabolism and overexpression of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (Fig. -). Lab testing showed a low fasting blood glucose (BG) of 2.2 mmol/L (reference range: 3.9\u20136.1 mmol/L), a high proinsulin level of 4455.9 pg/mL (reference range: 30\u2013180 ng/mL), a normal C-peptide level of 2.56 ng/mL (reference range: 0.8\u20134.2 ng/mL), a serum insulin level of 15.35 \u03bcIU/mL (reference range: 5.2\u201317.2 \u03bcIU/mL), and a gastrin level of 92.6 pg/mL (reference range: < 100 pg/mL). These results confirmed a diagnosis of insulinoma. Imaging examination showed no abnormalities indicative of parathyroid adenoma or malignancy in the pituitary or adrenal glands. Lab testing showed normal levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), blood calcium, phosphate, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 24-h urinary free cortisol (24 hUFC), and serum cortisol. Her luteinizing hormone (LH) level was 0.24 IU/L (reference range: 2.12\u201310 IU/L during the follicular phase), which was considered related to her age.\nPreoperative preparation: To avoid recurrent symptoms and to maintain her fasting BG at a tolerably low level, the patient was given regular snacks before bedtime. BG can be controlled at a level between 50 and 60 mg/dL preoperatively.\nSurgical procedure: The patient underwent minimally invasive insulinoma enucleation surgery under the Da Vinci robot-assisted system with intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) connected. The patient was put in a head-low, feet-high and left-lateral position. The robotic system was positioned at the head of the patient, while the assistant surgeon stood between the patient\u2019s legs. Abdominal exploration via laparoscopy was conducted, and no obvious abnormalities were found. The robotic lens and operating arms were docked. The gastrocolic ligament was dissected with an ultrasonically activated scalpel. The head of the pancreas was exposed by grasping the colon downward and lifting the stomach. Towards the tail of the pancreas, we separated and exposed the spleen. The surgeon then controlled the ultrasound probe, exploring the tumor from the pancreatic tail to the head and the uncinated process with the assistance of a prograsp clamp. A quasi-circular, hypoechoic lesion was found at the end of the pancreas with a diameter of approximately 10 mm and a clear boundary. We marked the normal pancreatic tissue around the lesion with an electrotome, and while dividing the pancreas sequentially, suction was used continually to visualize the tumor capsule. Precise positioning was achieved using IOUS, and the tumor was completely resected along the capsule (Fig. -). A peritoneal drainage tube was placed. The surgery went well, lasting 65 min (skin to skin), and the volume of intraoperative bleeding was 5 mL. Intraoperative BG is documented in Table .\nAfter surgery, the patient was given liquid diet on POD2. The drain was clean and was removed on POD4, and the patient gradually resumed her normal diet. She was discharged to home on POD6. During the following 1.5 years, the patient had no recurrence of the disease. No postoperative complication occurred, such as pancreatic fistula or pancreatic function deficiency.\nPathological examination showed that the tumor was a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (Grade 2 with a Ki-67 index of 4%) (Fig. -). This tumor was positive for CgA, Syn, and AE1/AE3 (Fig. -). Insulin staining was partially positive (Fig. ), while gastrin, glucagon, and somatostatin staining were negative (Fig. -).\nSanger-directed sequencing for the MEN1 gene mutation was performed on a peripheral blood sample, revealing a homozygous pathogenic mutation of c247_250delCTGT (p.Ile85Serfs*33) (Fig. ).

{"clinical_note": "A 41-year-old woman presented to our hospital for further evaluation and management of persistent liver dysfunction, painless xanthochromia, and skin itching for 3 months.\nOn admission, a physical examination showed severe icteric sclera and skin without abdominal tenderness or positive shifting dullness. Liver function showed severe hepatic injury and obstructive jaundice (Table ). US showed a 5.0 \u00d7 5.3 cm, well-circumscribed anechoic lesion with many separations, increased through-transmission of sound, and no evidence of mural nodularity. Epigastric enhanced CT showed a cystic mass with sharply defined margins and smooth, thin, non-reinforced walls in the left medial liver lobe, and obstruction of the biliary tract. The contents of the mass were homogeneous, with water-density lesions, suggesting that it was a cyst. MRI showed a homogeneously hypointense lesion on T1-weighted imaging and this was homogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. US, CT, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed a slightly ectatic right hepatic duct, a greatly ectatic left hepatic duct and common bile duct, an enlarged gallbladder, and a normal distal end of the choledochus (Fig. ). Possible reasons for biliary obstruction were bile duct tumor, common bile duct stones, or compression of the common bile duct by a hepatic cyst.\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) was performed to define the cause of obstruction. This procedure showed that the right hepatic duct was ectatic, but the left hepatic duct and common bile duct were not observed. There were no stone, but a large lump was observed in the common bile duct, which suggested suspicious bile duct tumor. Endoscopic sphincterotomy, endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage(ERBD), and endoscopic nasobiliary draingage(ENBD) were successfully performed to drain bile for severe hepatic injury and jaundice, rather than laparotomy, because of coagulation disorders (Fig. ). After these procedures, the icteric sclera and skin gradually faded, liver function was obviously improved, and coagulation disorders were close to normal levels (Table ).\nFour weeks later, an open operation was performed for suspicion of bile duct tumor. In exploration of the common bile duct by a choledochoscope, a large pedunculated lump protruding into the common bile duct from the left hepatic duct was discovered. This lump was completely removed from the root of the lump by endoscopic needle-knife electrotomy without active hemorrhage (Fig. ). The morphology of the lump was similar to the gallbladder with a capsule wall and capsular space (Fig. ). The choledochoscope was inserted into the hepatic duct from the stump of the lump and there was no viscous liquid secreted by cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. Postoperative pathology of the lump suggested a hepatic cyst wall without heterocysts or tumor cells (Fig. ). A T tube was retained in the common bile duct in order to prevent bile leakage and observe the recovery of the root incision of the lump and postoperative bleeding.\nTwo months later, all of the liver function indices recovered to the normal range (Table ). Epigastric US and CT showed a normal hepatic duct and the hepatic cyst was the same size compared with preoperatively. A choledochoscopic examination was performed through a T-tube fistula. There was no evidence of bile duct tumor. The choledochoscope could enter into the cyst from the defect of the bile duct wall, and the mucosa around the incision recovered well, with no signs of stricture.\nThree years after the procedure, the patient was in a good general condition, without signs of cholestasis or bile duct stones. The cyst had barely changed (Fig. ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "Prior to this admission, a 27-year-old woman sought medical attention at a local hospital because of facial redness and edema caused by eating a mango. She was treated with dexamethasone (5 mg intravenously daily) for five days. The patient gradually developed a round face, acne, hirsutism, hypokalemia, and 5 kg of weight loss over the course of one month since receiving dexamethasone. Upon hospitalization, the patient presented with a one-month history of facial edema, weight loss, and acne. She had no family history of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. A 5.5-cm mass located in the right posterior lobe of the liver was detected by ultrasound in a routine physical examination 16 months ago at a local hospital; however, the patient had no symptom and did not seek further medical attention at that time.\nThe patient\u2019s blood pressure was 120/75 mmHg in both arms in the supine position, with a regular pulse of 76 bpm. Her height was 164 cm and her weight was 48 kg (body mass index:17.8 kg/m2). The patient had \u201cmoon face\u201d and severe facial edema, beard, central deposition of fat with slim extremities and atrophic muscles, and no pretibial edema. The skin was diffused with acne and both armpits had hyperpigmentaion.\nLaboratory tests revealed marked hypokalemia (2.1 mmol/L; normal range, 3.5\u20135.5 mmol/L), which could not be normalized with oral and intravenous potassium supplementation until spironolactone was added. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test confirmed diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood glucose level of 9.19 mmol/l and a 2-h glucose level of 21.66 mmol/L, with a HbA1c level of 6.3%. She was started on insulin aspart30 (48 U daily).\nEndocrinological investigation identified severe hypercortisolism with loss of circadian rhythm. Plasma ACTH level was elevated to 1157 pg/mL, confirming ACTH-dependent Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Except for testosterone, the catecholamine metabolites, growth hormone, calcitonin, and prolactin levels were all within the normal range (Table ).\nMRI and contrasted MRI revealed no pituitary adenoma and EAS was considered. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scanning revealed that the mass lesion was located in the right adrenal gland and not in the right hepatic posterior lobe. The mass was a heterogeneous solid tumor which was mildly enhanced with some patchy nonenhancing areas (Fig. ). PET/CT showed moderate fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the mass (Fig. ). Both contrasted CT and PET-CT revealed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, but the neck, thorax, and pelvis were normal.\nWe prepared to do inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) for ACTH assays, adrenal vein sampling for ACTH assays to make out the origin of ACTH. But the patient\u2019s general condition rapidly deteriorated after admission, Adrenal tumorectomy was performed. During surgery, when the right adrenal mass was mobilized, no hypertensive crisis occurred. A 6.5-cm black mass was found arising from the medial branch of the right adrenal gland (Fig. ). Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the tumor revealed that most of the cells were chromaffin-like cells. In addition, there were multifocal oval eosinophilic cells under the tumor capsule (Fig. ). Immunohistochemical staining showed positive staining for chromogranin A (CgA) (Fig. ) and CD56 (Fig. ), with a Ki67 labeling index of approximately 16% (Fig. ) for chromaffin-like cells. No positive ACTH immunostaining was noticed (Fig. ). Positive immunostaining for CRH and Melan-A (Fig. and ) and negative immunostaining for CgA and CD56 were found in the eosinophilic cells, indicating that CRH production is indeed derived from the tumor\u2019s peripheral cells.\nOne day after surgery, ACTH levels had decreased from 715 to 14.3 pg/ml and serum cortisol level had decreased from more than 50 to 10.4 \u03bcg/dl. One week postoperatively, blood potassium and glucose levels normalized without the need for medication. The signs and symptoms of Cushing\u2019s syndrome gradually disappeared within two months, and the hydrocortisone supplementation (initial dosage was 60 mg daily and tapered gradually) was discontinued seven weeks postoperatively. CT revealed that the left adrenal gland was almost reduced to the normal size three months later.

The child was on daily peritoneal dialysis for renal failure and on dapsone for Pneumocystis prophylaxis for the last six months. During the hospital stay, she developed multiple complications, including sepsis, electrolyte imbalance, and thrombocytopenia. She was on various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, mycophenolate, prednisolone, pantoprazole, cefepime, and dapsone. During the third week of hospital stay, the child had diarrhea and then developed metabolic acidosis. She was also noted to have cyanosis, low oxygen saturation (82% to 87%) by pulse oximetry (peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SPO2)), despite the escalation of inspired oxygen to 100%. A blood gas analysis consistent with metabolic acidosis (ph 7.23, oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) 125 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCo2) 42 mmHg, HCo3 14.6, bases excess (BE) -9). With cyanosis, low oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SPO2) in the setting of normal oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) methemoglobinemia was suspected. Co-oximetry was ordered, which revealed a methemoglobin level of 21.5% (normal range 0 to 2%). Laboratory workup ruled out hemolysis. Since the child had end-stage renal disease, methylene blue was not considered as a treatment option, and she was started on daily ascorbic acid 500 mg via a gastrostomy tube. Dapsone was discontinued and pentamidine nebulization monthly started for Pneumocystis prophylaxis. Serial methemoglobin levels on co-oximetry showed an improving trend. Within 48 hours, the methemoglobinemia resolved and the level came down to 0.4 mg/dl. Ascorbic acid was continued for four more days and discontinued. Off ascorbic acid, the methemoglobin level remained less than 0.3 mg/dl. After a meticulous review of the medications and workup, we concluded that dapsone was the probable cause of methemoglobinemia in this child.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'mechanisms, drugs', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Throughout his childhood he had chronic arthralgia and swelling of his ankles diagnosed as juvenile idiopathic arthritis. By age 4, he manifested developmental delays, including difficulty with ambulation. At the age of 20, he developed recurrent ischemic strokes causing persistent dysarthria, ataxia, and weakness. During that time, he developed recurrent violaceous subcutaneous lesions that would ulcerate, but were responsive to glucocorticoids. He was diagnosed with PAN based on skin biopsies. He required a long-term maintenance dose of prednisone 7.5 mg daily, as reduction would led to recurrent skin lesions. In childhood, he developed poorly explained visual loss without evidence of inflammatory eye disease on physical exam. His visual acuity had been stable for the last couple years prior to presentation. His history was also remarkable for recurrent mouth and genital ulcers, which were also responsive to glucocorticoids.

He was initially treated with radiation therapy alone, but later transitioned to chemotherapy [initially with MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) and later converted to ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine)] with remission achieved 1 year later. At age 24, he developed sudden onset left-sided persistent numbness followed by bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with near complete left-sided deafness. At age 26, he presented with bright red blood in his stool, which required resection of 6 inches of small intestines for reasons that were unclear.

Five years prior, the patient began suffering from intermittent and gradually deteriorating occipital and frontal headaches. One month prior to admission, she had impaired vision and an absent right temporal view and simultaneous bilateral galactorrhea, without purulent or bloody secretions. Since the onset of symptoms, the patient experienced no nausea or vomiting, sleepiness, chills, hair loss, or fatigue. Computed tomography (CT) showed an irregular cystic solid mass in the suprasellar area. The size of the mass was 1.4*1 cm and could be markedly enhanced. The CT value of the solid part of the lesion on plain CT was 40 Hounsfield units (HU); in the enhancement, the value was 74 HU, and the cystic part showed no enhancement. The boundary of the lesion was less clear, the density was not uniform, and no obvious calcification was observed. The cavernous sinus was involved. There were no abnormalities in the ventricular system, sulcus, brain split and pool. Moreover, there was no shift in the midline structure, and no abnormalities were found in the skull structure. The sinuses exhibited no obvious abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and pituitary showed an irregular cystic solid mass in the suprasellar area, involving in the pituitary stalk, and the boundary between the lesion and pituitary was unclear. In addition, the mass pressed on the optic chiasm, and the solid part of the lesion was significantly enhanced, while the cystic part showed no enhancement. There was no abnormal signal in the brain or paranasal sinuses nor signs of calcification (Figure ). Auxiliary examinations revealed that the patient's urine volume and specific gravity were within the normal range (urine volume: 1,800 mL/day; urine specific gravity: 1.015). A pituitary function evaluation showed hyperprolactinemia (45.47 \u03bcg/L, normal range for female: 2.8\u201329.2 U/L) and intact growth hormone (GH) and gonadotropin function. The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) level was 120 ng/ml (109\u2013284 ng/ml). The pituitary-thyroid and pituitary-adrenal axis were intact (Tables \u2013). The blood sedimentation and CRP level were normal, and indicators related to tuberculosis and other infections were negative. Because of the thickening of the pituitary stalk, CSF analysis was performed to identify the nature of the mass lesion before any invasive procedures were performed. The results of CSF analysis were normal except for a significantly increased human HCG (18.54 U/L, normal range: 0\u20135 U/L) level. However, the serum HCG and \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were normal. A biopsy was recommended to clarify the diagnosis, but the patient declined. Considering the possibility of a germinoma, radiotherapy was recommended. No regression of the intracranial mass and no resolution of the headache were observed after 10 radiotherapy treatments (total 10 Gy). Therefore, the patient was admitted a second time. Apart from a deficiency in GH and hypogonadotropic hormones, the other axes were intact (Tables \u2013). The IGF-1 level was 89 ng/ml (109\u2013284 ng/ml). A repeated CSF analysis indicated there was no obvious decrease in the HCG level in the CSF (17.41 U/L, normal range: 0\u20135 U/L). An MRI showed no signs of shrinkage of the mass (Figure ). Due to the enlarged intracranial mass, the patient was transferred to the neurosurgical department for total resection of the mass. The pathological analysis was indicative of a craniopharyngioma (Figure ).\nUnder a microscope, the lateral fissure was separated at the saddle area, and CSF was released. The brain tissue collapsed, and a portion of the temporal lobe was removed. The tumor was located in the suprasellar area. The tumor was removed from the second gap along the longitudinal axis of the pituitary stalk and was frozen for analysis. The tumor and hypothalamus were closely related. Hemostasis was achieved, and the gauze inventory was correct. The surgery was complete following strict closure of the dura mater, bone flap reduction and fixation, suturing of the temporalis muscle and scalp, and placement of an external dura mater drain. The tumor specimens were sent for pathological analysis.\nAfter surgery, the patient did well and had no complaints of headache, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, sleepiness, or anorexia. She did not receive any hormone replacement. One year later, she was admitted to our endocrinology department for re-evaluation. Her urine volume and specific gravity were within the normal range (urine volume: 1,500 mL/day; urine specific gravity: 1.017). The urine osmotic pressure was 752 mOsm/L (0\u20131,000 mOsm/L), the blood osmolality was 292 mOsm/L, and a pituitary stimulation test revealed normal frontal lobe function except for an impaired GH level (Tables , ). The IGF-1 level was 92 ng/ml. HCG levels in the serum and CSF were within normal limits (serum HCG: 0.1 U/L; CSF HCG: 0.31 U/L). The slightly increased prolactin detected preoperatively had decreased to within the normal range. Cranial and pituitary MRI showed no expansion of the sellar region, no signs of a local tumor, no abnormal enhancement, a clear boundary of the optic chiasm, and no signs of tumor recurrence (Figure ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Of note, his uncle with XLP1 had a history of EBV-related central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. SAP expression was found to be absent in NK and CD8 cells, confirming the diagnosis of XLP1. NKT cells were undetectable. Profound hypogammaglobulinemia was also noted. He was monitored and maintained on monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions with only minor breakthrough sinopulmonary infections. Adherence to IVIG was suboptimal due to social reasons.

Her intact parathyroid hormone level was 66.0 pg/ml (normal value: 10\u201365 pg/mL) and her adjusted serum calcium level was 10.3 mg/dL (normal value: 8.7\u20139.9 mg/dL), although parathyroid ultrasound examination revealed no parathyroid tumor. Other tumors complicated with MEN-1 were not detected. The results of other preoperative examinations were unremarkable. On the day before surgery, an Enlite\u2122 sensor of MiniMed\u2122 620G (Medtronic Diabetes, Northridge, CA, USA) SCGM system was inserted into her upper arm. Although MiniMed 620G was combined with an insulin pump, we did not use the pump. The SCGM system was calibrated as recommended by the manufacturer with capillary BG measured by OneTouch\u00ae UltraVue\u2122 Blood Glucose Meter (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA).\nNo premedication was given and she walked into the operating room. Capillary BG was 80 mg/dL and the SCGM system was calibrated. Continuous glucose infusion was started at 4.6 g/hr, and general anesthesia was induced with 80 mg of propofol, 50 mcg of fentanyl, and 0.02 mcg/kg/min of remifentanil. Muscle relaxation was obtained by administration of 30 mg of rocuronium, and the trachea was intubated. After induction of general anesthesia, an epidural catheter was inserted at the eighth and ninth thoracic interspace. Anesthesia was maintained with 1.7% sevoflurane, 0.01\u20130.02 mcg/kg/min of remifentanil, and intermittent thoracic epidural administration of 0.25% levobupivacaine (3 ml). An arterial catheter was inserted, and arterial BG measured by an ABL800 Flex Blood Gas Analyzer (Radiometer, Brea, CA, USA) was 71 mg/dL, which was compatible with IG of 73 mg/dL. An additional 2 g of glucose was given intravenously before the start of surgery, and IG increased from 77 mg/dL to 101 mg/dL at 20 minutes (). After that, IG mildly decreased and returned to almost the same level after 1 hour. The surgeon informed us that the tumor would be removed by enucleation shortly. Just before tumor resection, arterial BG was 76 mg/dL and IG was 80 mg/dL. At 20 minutes after tumor resection, IG showed a rapid increase. We therefore decreased the continuous glucose infusion rate to the usual dose of 1 g/hr, and IG gradually decreased and was stabilized at about 140 mg/dL. During surgery, blood pressure was between 90/50 and 120/70 mmHg, and heart rate was between 60 and 90 bpm. She was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the general surgery ward. The operation time was 2 h and 24 min, and the anesthesia time was 3 h and 53 min. Postoperative pain was controlled well by continuous epidural analgesia (12 mcg of fentanyl and 0.2% levobupivacaine at 4 ml/hr) and administration of 600 mg of acetaminophen (every 6 hr). Her postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on POD 10.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

This procedure went uneventful and the patient was discharged 3 days after surgery. However, within one week after the procedure the patient experienced pain at the left side of the scrotum and left upper leg. During physical examination, a hypersensitive scrotum (allodynia) was noted whereas no other abnormalities were seen. The urologist was consulted but no urologic complications were found. The neuropathic pain area befitted the genitofemoral nerve (GFN). Conservative treatment was initiated with neuroleptic drugs and blocks of the L1/L2 dorsal roots with local anaesthetics and pulsed radiofrequency lesioning. These treatments did not result in significant pain relief and he could not work. Three years after the start of the neuropathic pain, operative treatment aiming at pain relief was initiated. In a multidisciplinary meeting it was concluded that a nerve entrapment of the GFN was suspected to be the most likely cause of the patient's neuropathic pain. Eventually, an exploratory transperitoneal laparoscopy was performed. After extensive adhesiolysis, a hemoclip used for closure of the ureter at the time of nephrectomy was identified in close relation to the GFN and removed. Due to the local scarring it could not be surgically assessed to which extent the GFN was actually damaged or a neuroma was formed. It seemed, however, highly likely that the pain originated from the GFN in this area. We therefore cut the GFN proximally in a normal looking segment (). Pathological analysis of the tissue confirmed this to contain nerve tissue.

{"clinical_note": "A 32-year-old Caucasian male with a known history of depression presented to the emergency department accompanied by police after a violent outburst following prolonged DFE abuse during a suicide attempt. On admission, he was emotionally labile and had contusions on his left shoulder and upper extremities due to a physical altercation with police. He was initially confused and verbally abusive, but within six hours he was oriented, cooperative, and able to provide a reliable history.\nThe patient stated that he had huffed keyboard cleaner several days per week for the past year; however, the frequency had increased over the last month to several times daily. Other than depression, the patient had no other known medical problems. He denied any personal or family history of kidney disease. The patient denied drinking alcohol, and he reported smoking one-half pack of cigarettes per day for the previous two years. He denied any other substance abuse except for DFE. He reported no use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications. During this episode of difluoroethane abuse, he had no loss of consciousness, but experienced frightening visual and auditory hallucinations as well as anxiety that persisted even after returning to his self-reported baseline mental status.\nInitial labs revealed a WBC count of 21,000 with polymorphonuclear predominance of 81%, an elevated creatinine of 1.5mg/dL with no known baseline, BUN of 10mg/dL, GFR of 54 mL/min/1.73 m2, lactic acidosis, creatine kinase of 350 U/L, and a carboxyhemoglobin level of 3.1%. Urinalysis was significant for 3+ proteinuria, moderate blood, 14 RBCs, 3 WBCs, and 3 hyaline casts.

During the initial examination, it was observed that the right upper central incisor had an unsatisfactory temporary Richmond type crown that was changed by a metal core, post, and new temporary crown. The new temporary crown was fitted to the removable partial denture that was used by the patient (). Surgical guides were made and the patient was referred for implant placement, in the region of teeth 12, 35, 36, 44, and 46.\nAfter approximately 8 months, it was verified that the implant located in the anterior region was positioned further apical and buccal () making it impossible to fabricate a successful implant crown from an esthetic point of view.\nThe implant was gradually removed using the implant removal instrument (Implant Retrieval Tool; Nobel Biocare), with antirotational movement (). Following this surgical procedure, a new implant was installed (cone morse 3.5 \u00d7 11 mm, Conex\u00e3o, Brazil), with a torque of 30 N, and positioned in the mesiodistal direction. Specifically, the implant was placed closer to tooth 14 in the buccal-palatine direction on the bone ridge (located around 1 mm for the palatal from an imaginary curvature passing through the buccal surfaces of the present teeth and 1 mm infraosseo in the coronoapical direction) ().\nAfter the surgery, the removable partial denture was removed. This was followed by the fabrication of a temporary fixed partial prosthesis with retention used during the osseointegration phase on teeth 11 and 14 (): this was only for esthetic purpose. This was in addition to the installation of prostheses on the implants in the regions of teeth 35, 36, 44, and 46.\nImmediately after the second stage surgery, the temporary fixed partial denture was performed using the healing cap as an abutment and a lateral incisor as a mesial cantilever. Following the rehabilitation procedures, this temporary fixed partial denture was changed to a provisional fixed prosthesis with the mesial cantilever screwed into the implant. During this phase, periodic acrylic resin implements were added to the temporary prosthesis to promote gingival conditioning (Figures and ) and black triangle closure (Figures and ) and also to improve gingival esthetics.\nAt the end of two months, the implant prosthesis with a mesial cantilever was installed ().

{"clinical_note": "A 26-year-old Yemeni male patient from Taiz Province was referred to the restorative dental clinics at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. His chief complaint was an unpleasant smile caused by generalized tooth discoloration. His medical history was irrelevant. The fluoride level in the water around Taiz Province is >3.6 mg/l [].\nClinical examination revealed generalized fluorosis with loss of the outermost enamel in irregular areas involving less than half of the entire surface, as well as changes in the morphology caused by merging pits and marked attrition (). In this case, based on the Thylstrup and Fejerskov index (TFI) for dental fluorosis classification, the dental fluorosis was classified as TFI = 7 [].\nAfter the clinical examination, radiographs, preoperative photographs, and upper and lower alginate impressions for diagnostic models were taken. The patient was presented with treatment options, which included ceramic or composite veneers, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The patient agreed to smile enhancement using ceramic veneers for his upper teeth given that he desired an optimum aesthetic and a long-term result. The veneers would be placed on the patient's upper teeth, from his upper right 2nd premolar to upper left 2nd premolar. The patient decided to postpone veneering his lower teeth, given his limited financial capacity. Diagnostic models were analyzed to evaluate the occlusion, and a diagnostic wax-up was made of white-colored wax. The use of the wax-up allows the patient to preview the desired appearance of his teeth, and this wax-up is also essential for the fabrication of a clear matrix for temporary restorations.\nThe desired shade was selected using the VITAPAN classical shade guide (VITA Zahnfabrik, Germany). The enamel of the eight maxillary teeth was prepared using a flat-end tapered diamond bur to a depth of 0.5\u20130.75 mm facial reduction with 1.5 mm incisal reduction (). A chamfer finish line was maintained at the level of the gingival margin. The proximal margin was extended into the facial and gingival embrasures.\nFollowing tooth preparation, gingival retraction was achieved using retraction cords (Ultrapak Cord #00, Ultradent Products Inc., South Jordan, UT, USA) soaked in a hemostatic agent. Impressions were taken with a polyvinylsiloxane material (Virtual, Ivoclar Vivadent, Amherst, NY). The impression material was manipulated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Temporization was performed by spot etching on the facial surface of each prepared tooth with 37% phosphoric acid (Total Etch, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). Bonding agent (OptiBond Solo Plus, Kerr, Orange, CA, USA) was applied on the enamel-etched spots and light cured for 20 seconds using a high-intensity light-emitting diode (LED) curing light (Elipar S10, 3M ESPE, MN, USA). The clear matrix that was previously fabricated was loaded with a temporization material (Protemp Plus, 3M ESPE, MN, USA) and placed over the prepared teeth. Light curing was done for 10 seconds per tooth. Then, the matrix was gently teased away from the prepared teeth. A number 12 scalpel blade was used to remove the partially cured temporization material. Facial and lingual embrasures were refined with a thin diamond disk, the occlusion was adjusted, and the temporary restorations were polished using polishing discs and points ().\nCeramic veneers were fabricated with a lithium disilicate-reinforced glass ceramic material (IPS e.max Press, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). Temporary veneers were removed, and the teeth were cleaned using pumice. Ceramic veneers were tried-in using a transparent shade try-in paste (Variolink Veneer try-in paste, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) to assess marginal adaptation and shade.\nAfterwards, veneers were prepared for bonding. Fitting surfaces of the veneers were etched with hydrofluoric acid (Porcelain Etchant 9.5%, Bisco Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA) for 60 seconds, washed under running water for another 60 seconds, and dried with an air syringe. A layer of silane coupling agent (Monobond Plus, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) was applied on the veneers' fitting surfaces and gently air-dried after one minute. Then, the prepared teeth were etched using 37% phosphoric acid for 30 seconds, rinsed, and dried. A clear mylar strip was placed interproximally to prevent inadvertent bonding to the adjacent tooth and to facilitate the subsequent removal of excess resin cement in the embrasures. A layer of bonding agent (Adhese Universal, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) was applied on the prepared tooth surfaces and air-thinned. Then, Heliobond (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) was placed on the prepared tooth surfaces. The inner surface of the veneers was covered with light-cured resin cement (Variolink Veneer, transparent shade, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). Veneers were positioned appropriately on the teeth by applying gentle pressure, following which excess resin cement was carefully removed with an explorer before light curing. Light curing was first performed for 2 seconds, and the excess resin cement was removed with a microbrush. After that, each veneer was light-cured from the facial aspect for 40 seconds and from the lingual aspect for 40 seconds. The two veneers of the central incisors were first simultaneously cemented. This was followed by cementation of the veneers of the two lateral incisors. Then, the veneers of the two canines were cemented. Finally, veneers for the first and second premolars were cemented simultaneously on each side.\nMinimal gingival flash of the resin luting cement was removed with a number 12 scalpel blade. A flame-shaped fine diamond bur was used to finish the ceramic margins and to contour the embrasure surfaces. Occlusion was assessed and adjusted. Flossing was performed to ensure interproximal contact patency. Ceramic polishing was performed using a series of polishing cups and points (OptraFine polishing system, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). Interproximal contacts were finished with finishing and polishing strips. Final surface lustre was achieved by using a diamond polishing paste with a rubber prophylaxis cup. The postoperative clinical photographs are shown in .

{"clinical_note": "A 75-year-old male visited a urological practitioner because of nocturia. An elevated serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level of 76.2 ng/mL was observed, and digital rectal examination showed diffuse induration of the prostate. Pelvic MRI demonstrated extensive high signal of the prostate in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (). Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT revealed multiple spine and pelvic bone and para-aortic and pelvic lymph node metastases (Figures and ). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer (cT3aN1M1b) and treated without prostate needle biopsy, with primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), including a GnRH antagonist (degarelix) and anti-androgen agent (bicalutamide). The PSA level immediately declined and reached nadir (0.23 ng/mL) after 8 months. However, 15 months after the start of ADT (PSA level, 2.33 ng/mL), the patient was diagnosed with CRPC and referred to our hospital.\nTo evaluate the patient's current disease status, we performed CT, bone scan, and WB-MRI. We observed discrepancies between the WB-MRI, bone scan, and CT. CT showed multiple osteoblastic lesions in the spine and pelvic bone (Figures and ) and shrunken para-aortic lymph nodes. Bone scan similarly showed multiple accumulations at the same bone sites as the CT (). However, these osteoblastic lesions showed almost no high signal in DWI of WB-MRI, suggesting that the lesions did not have viable tumor cells (Figures \u2013). In contrast, the primary lesion had a diffuse high signal remaining in DWI of WB-MRI ().\nWe then performed histopathological examinations of both the prostate and the vertebra. The prostate needle biopsy demonstrated that 10 of 12 cores had viable prostate cancer cells (). Meanwhile, we performed the CT-guided needle biopsy from the osteoblastic lesion of the second lumbar vertebra, which was diagnosed with bone metastasis by CT and bone scintigraphy, to exclude vertebral bone metastasis of prostate cancer by an orthopedic unit of another hospital, which the patient visited owing to lumbago and bilateral lower limb paralysis. Histopathological examination of the osteoblastic lesion demonstrated no malignant cells (). Considering the results of the bone needle biopsy, we comprehensively reviewed the patient's image findings. A CT scan in the second lumbar vertebra revealed an osteoblastic change (885.4 Hounsfield unit), T1- and T2-weighted imaging of MRI revealed low signal intensity, and the ADC value was low (0.498 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm2/s); however, b = 0 and b = 1200 of DWI exhibited no high signal intensity, suggesting a benign osteoblastic change induced by the treatment effect (Figures \u2013). With orthopedic conservative therapy in accordance with the diagnosis of lumbar hernia, the lumbago and bilateral lower limb paralysis completely resolved.\nBased on the findings of our WB-MRI and histopathological examinations, we reasoned that viable tumor cells inducing disease progression may primarily exist in the primary lesions and not in the metastatic lesions. Then, to control the overall disease, we changed the patient's medication from bicalutamide to enzalutamide for potentially existing micrometastases and added prostate RT (74 Gy). After this, his elevated PSA immediately declined and was controlled at a level of <0.2 ng/mL.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 64-year-old-man with an eighty-pack-year smoking history presented with insidious onset of worsening shortness of breath over a period of 6 months. He had previously undergone ablation for atrial fibrillation, as well as surgery and radiation for prostate cancer. Six months before presenting to our institution, he had fallen and fractured 2 right-sided ribs and developed an upper respiratory tract infection one month later. Over the next 3 months, the patient continued to experience intermittent fevers, chills, cough, wheezing, and exertional dyspnea.\nThe patient was initially treated with oral antibiotics for presumed community-acquired pneumonia; however, his symptoms persisted despite multiple courses of antibiotics and inhaled bronchodilators, and he was ultimately hospitalized. Serum serology for coccidioidomycosis was negative. Sputum cultures grew normal upper respiratory flora. His chest radiograph showed a left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate. A computed tomogram (CT) of the chest showed a LLL consolidation, with evidence of narrowing of the LLL bronchus (). There was an abrupt cutoff in the LLL bronchus, but no endobronchial lesion was detected (). A bronchoscopy performed at the hospital showed a \u201crounded, nonulcerating, pink mass-like growth\u201d obstructing the LLL bronchus. Brushings from the growth were negative for malignancy, but no biopsies were obtained. He was referred to our center for evaluation of this endobronchial lesion.\nUpon further examination, the patient recalled a significant decline in his exercise tolerance about 6 months prior to the current presentation. His pulmonary function tests showed severe airflow obstruction, with FEV1 of 1.53 L (42% predicted), which was a decline from his previous FEV1 of 2.2 L (63% predicted) 6 months earlier. The patient's physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the lower left lung base, with wheezing limited to the LLL. Although he had continued to smoke for the past 6 months, he had quit smoking 3 weeks prior to the current presentation. Based on his symptom complex, worsening airflow obstruction, and the mass seen on prior bronchoscopy, the likely differential diagnoses included primary lung cancer, lung carcinoid tumor, and foreign body aspiration. Although foreign body aspiration was unlikely, the development and progression of his symptoms over just 6 months would also be unusual for primary lung cancer or for lung carcinoid tumor.\nThe patient underwent another bronchoscopy, which revealed a narrow LLL bronchus, with a fleshy endobronchial mass lesion (). Multiple fine needle aspirates were obtained using a Wang needle (CONMED, Utica, NY), but every pass was positive for dense acute inflammation on rapid onsite evaluation. Multiple endobronchial biopsies were then obtained, and 2 pearly white structures with a brown detached cover were revealed (). The object was extracted in its entirety using a Zero Tip Airway Retrieval Basket (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) and biopsy forceps; the object was identified as an aspirated almond. An ultrathin bronchoscope was then used to examine the airways distal to the aspirated almond, and there was no evidence of any additional foreign material. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at the end of the case, and specimens were sent for culture. Pathology of the extracted foreign body was consistent with vegetable matter (), and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures were negative for bacterial or fungal organisms.\nA 10-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate was prescribed due to the imaging evidence of aspiration pneumonia secondary to almond aspiration. On follow-up examination one month later, he reported drastically increased exercise tolerance and his cough and wheezing had disappeared; meanwhile, pulmonary function tests showed an increase in his FEV1 to 2.12 L (60% predicted), and a repeat flexible bronchoscopy revealed no bronchial stricture. The patient shared that while he was recovering from his rib fractures, his favorite snack (enjoyed in the supine position) was almonds. While foreign body aspiration for 6 months could lead to irreversible parenchymal changes, a follow-up CT scan at 3 months revealed complete resolution of parenchymal infiltrates in this case (). At the time of his 6-month follow-up, his exercise tolerance had returned to baseline and he had successfully quit smoking.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A healthy 11-year-old girl was presented to the National University of Malaysia (UKM) Paediatric Dental Clinic with a referral for further management of pulp necrosis of an immature lower right second premolar (tooth 45), secondary to the fractured tubercle of dens evaginatus. Two weeks earlier, she had treatment at a general dental clinic for pain related to tooth 45. Tooth 45 had spontaneous and lingering pain following cold and thermal stimuli. The tooth was diagnosed to have symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, and root canal therapy was initiated. The canal was accessed, and pulp extirpation performed before the placement of intracanal nonsetting calcium hydroxide by the general dental practitioner (GDP).\nAt the time of current assessment, her tooth-related symptoms had completely resolved. General oral examination showed the presence of generalised mild gingivitis with a basic periodontal examination (BPE) score of 1 in all sextants. The patient's oral hygiene was fair with a plaque score of 30%. The patient is still in her mixed dentition with the presence of the primary maxillary canines. Her upper dental arch was well aligned, and mild crowding of anterior teeth was noted in the lower arch. Tooth 45 has an occlusal glass ionomer dressing of the access cavity made for the pulp extirpation earlier by the GDP (). Cold and electric pulp sensibility testings showed positive responses to all fully erupted premolars indicative of tooth vitality expect for tooth 45. Tooth 45 also has slight tenderness to percussion. Periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an immature root with convergent open apex and small periapical radiolucency. The pulp space of tooth 45 is of an even width from the coronal to the apical portion (). Based on the assessments, tooth 45 was diagnosed with pulp necrosis secondary to fractured dens evaginatus and symptomatic apical periodontitis.\nOn the day of initial assessment, tooth 45 was isolated with rubber dam after infiltration of local anaesthetic solution (2% lidocaine with 1 : 80000 adrenaline). Pulp chamber was reentered through the previously prepared access cavity. The root canal was exposed and irrigated with saline. After that, the canal was dried with paper points and the tooth working length was estimated with a K-file No. 60. A working length, 2 mm short of the apical opening, was determined (17 mm). The canal was gently prepared with the K-file No. 60 and then irrigated with a copious volume of 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI). After drying the wet canal with paper points, nonsetting calcium hydroxide was placed into the canal and the access cavity was double sealed with Cavit\u2122 3M, USA, and glass ionomer cement (GIC) (Riva Self Cure\u2122 SDI, Australia).\nTwo weeks later, the tooth was reassessed for any signs and symptoms of infection. The tooth was no longer tender to percussion, and there was no indication of infection-related signs and symptoms. After isolation with a rubber dam, the root canal of tooth 45 was reaccessed and irrigated with a copious volume 1.5% NaOCl to remove the nonsetting calcium hydroxide. Then, the canal was irrigated with sterile water and dried with paper points. Subsequently, the canal was irrigated with 17% EDTA (Pulpdent\u2122, Watertown, Massachusetts) for a minute and dried with paper points. Finally, under the guidance of a dental operating microscope (Carl Zeiss Surgical GmbH, S100), the apical region was filled using the EndoSequence (BC RRM-Fast Set Putty, Brasseler, USA) material up to 4 mm thickness to create an apical seal (). The orifice of the root canal was double sealed with a cotton pellet, temporary filling material (Cavit 3M, USA), and GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia).\nOnce again, the root canal was reaccessed two weeks later, irrigated with 1.5% NaOCl, and dried with paper points. Next, the dried canal was obturated with thermoplasticised gutta-perca using the Obtura III Max System (Obtura Spartan\u00ae Endodontics) (). After that, the access cavity was double sealed with GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia) and nanohybrid composite (AURA\u2122 SDI, Australia), respectively.\nFollowing the obturation, tooth 45 was reviewed at three-month and six-month intervals. During both reviews, tooth 45 was asymptomatic. However, at the six-month review, a periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an unexpected finding. The apical root of tooth 45 continued to grow beyond the apexification level with a normal periodontal ligament space and lamina dura. No evidence of periapical radiolucency was noted (). However, regular annual monitoring of tooth 45 is essential to ensure that the coronal seal is intact and no apical complication further arises.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

He started having fever, myalgia, anorexia, vomiting, jaundice, and colure on July 14, 2016. He took antiviral drugs with monohydrate dipyrone (750 mg/day) associated to chlorpheniramine maleate (6 mg/day) and paracetamol (>4 g/day) at his peril. He denied taking any other drugs on that occasion. Because his clinical condition had not improved, he went to the hospital, where he underwent medical tests such as complete blood count (CBC): hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL, hematocrit 39.6%, platelets 343,000/mm3, white blood cells (leucocytes 5200/mm3), liver function Aspartate transaminase (AST) 39.8 U/L, Alanine transaminase (ALT) 40.1 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 346 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 98.5 U/L. In addition, the NS1 test for dengue was negative and the abdominal ultrasound showed the liver with diffuse increase in parenchymal echogenicity, indicating mild/moderate steatosis. The patient was diagnosed with hepatitis due to the clinical signs assessed, results of laboratory tests, and excessive intake of paracetamol. The patient was hospitalized, and after 4 days of intravenous hydration and clinical assessment, he was discharged from the hospital.\nFifteen days after his discharge, the patient related that he had daily high fever, appetite loss, sweating, weight loss (8 kg), and progressive worsening. On August 6, 2016, the infectious disease specialist ordered new medical tests when examining the patient. The results revealed that blood count was hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL; hematocrit 30.7%; red blood cells 4.16 million/mm3; and platelets 200,000/mm3. It also revealed anisocytosis, microcytosis, and hypochromia; white blood cells were leucocytes 9700/mm3, banded neutrophils 6%, segmented neutrophils 76%, and lymphocytes 10%. Liver function tests indicated aspartate transaminase (AST) 64 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 85 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 560 U/L, and lactic dehydrogenase 248 U/L.

Serologies were ordered for leptospirosis, rickettsialpox, hepatitis, syphilis, Zika virus, Chikungunya, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). All of them had negative results.\nFurthermore, blood cultures were conventionally performed using the Bact/Alert 3D 120 automated microbial detection system. The initial incubation was performed with chocolate agar medium, in 5\u201310% CO2 at 35\u00b0C\u201337\u00b0C for 24 hours. Three blood samples were collected in the first 24 hours, at a minimum 15-minute interval between them, using venous puncture in different places. The colonies isolated on chocolate agar plates were identified by colonial morphology, gram stain, and oxidase reaction. Colonies appeared smooth, round, uniform, grey/brown, and 1 mm in diameter. The oxidase test and tributyrin agar test were positive. This result was positive for the presence of the microorganism M. osloensis in the three samples.\nTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was ordered, and it showed prolapsed mitral valve involving the posterior leaflet (P2 segment) with an echogenic structure adhered to the atrial face, with approximate dimensions of 0.47 \u00d7 0.85 cm, compatible with endocardial vegetation, determining failure of coaptation and a moderate degree of valvular insufficiency and eccentric jet. Intracavitary thrombi were absent, and systolic and diastolic functions of the left ventricle were normal. According to the criteria of Habib et al. [], the diagnosis of IE was confirmed, and the patient was hospitalized for intravenous antibiotic therapy.\nAntibiotic therapy was prescribed from August 8 to September 28 with the administration of vancomycin for four days, gentamicin for 10 days, and ampicillin for 6 days, and after the result of blood culture, ceftriaxone was introduced for 36 days. Remission of signs and symptoms was observed as of August 12. Laboratory tests results were better, and blood cultures were sterile. Theses exams were repeated on August 21 and on September 15. Their results showed no alteration.\nAfter completing the therapeutic treatment with specific antibiotics, the patient underwent serial laboratory tests and was hospitalized. Another TEE was carried (09/21), and it revealed chordal rupture and moderate mitral regurgitation. Surgical correction was performed.\nOn September 26, the patient underwent implantation of a mitral valve prosthesis. Surgery was performed without any complications. However, neither the culture nor the pathological anatomy of the surgically removed valve was performed. On October 06, the patient was discharged from the hospital with a prescription for oral anticoagulant warfarin.\nEighteen months after the endocarditis episode, the patient was asymptomatic, in good physical condition.

A plain X-ray and magnetic resonance image (MRI) confirmed an intraosseal tumor that extended from 4 cm below the knee joint proximally to about 4 cm from the ankle joint distally (). An open biopsy confirmed an adamantinoma histology. Different treatment options were thoroughly discussed with the patient, including a lower leg amputation with disarticulation of the knee, a total tibia resection and reconstruction with a tibia allograft, or a custom-made tibia EPR, which was eventually selected.\nThe tumor was resected with an extensive anteromedial approach, and the defect was reconstructed with a custom-made, silver-coated, modular endoprosthesis of the Modular Universal Tumor and Revision System (Implantcast\u00ae, Buxteh\u00fcde, Germany) (). The knee joint was reconstructed with a metal-on-poly articulation with a (unique) metal-on-metal hinge mechanism (). The ankle joint was reconstructed with a metal-on-poly hinge joint with a talar replacement, stabilized with a trans-talar and trans-calcanear hydroxyapatite-coated stem. A supplementary screw was used to add stability in the subtalar joint. The endoprosthesis was enveloped in a Trevira (Implantcast\u00ae) tube to facilitate the attachment of soft tissues and the patella tendon (). A microvascular latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was anastomosed to the tibia artery (end-to-side) and concomitant vein and wrapped around the prosthesis to avoid dead space and allow tension-free closure. In addition, a medial gastrocnemius muscle flap was transposed to cover the patellar tendon region; this was covered with a meshed split-thickness skin graft.\nA histological analysis of the resected specimen showed an adamantinoma that had spread throughout the entire tibia and the margins were wide: an unaffected periosteum as an anatomic barrier and a minimum of clear soft tissue margin of 3 mm. Due to intracortical location of the tumor, no massive muscle excision was needed.\nThe knee joint was immobilized in extension for 6 weeks to facilitate patella ligament attachment to the tube. Then, the joint was gradually mobilized. After 6 months, the patient's gait was almost normal, with mild limping. Local MRI and chest radiographs performed during the 8 years of follow-up showed no signs of local recurrence or distant metastasis. No loosening of the stem or other mechanical problem was reported. In a routine follow-up, in addition to radiographs, we used a local MRI with a metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS) technique [], which enables to observe local recurrences of the tumor around the massive titanium endoprosthesis.\nEight years postoperatively, the patient had most of the time no pain and could mobilize freely. The patient resumed working full-time as a kindergarten teacher, and she has maintained her previous active lifestyle (except downhill skiing). On her latest follow-up visit (at 8 years), the knee range of motion was 0\u2013105 degrees, ankle dorsiflexion was 5 degrees, and ankle flexion was 35 degrees. In the latest follow-up visit, we used 4 patient-related outcome (PRO) measures. The Musculoskeletal Society Tumor Score (MSTS) was 77%; the Oxford Knee score (OKS) was 35/48; the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) was 80/100; and the 15D was 0.87/1.\nThe metal-on-metal prosthesis caused an increase in metal ion concentrations: cobalt was 6 ppb and chromium was 8 ppb.

{"clinical_note": "A 26-year-old male healthy Asian student presented to an emergency department in Australia with sudden onset generalised weakness affecting predominantly his lower limbs after eating dinner. The patient reported difficulty standing and difficulty lifting his arms without any muscle pain or paraesthesia, headache, or back pain. Although he had experienced multiple similar episodes over the past month, these had been less severe and always self-resolved. It was unclear to the patient if these episodes of weakness were associated with food intake or exercise.\nOn further questioning, the patient reported 15-kilogram weight loss over the past three months and a four-day history of nonbloody diarrhoea, which resolved one week prior to presentation. He had otherwise been well and was playing soccer regularly. He had no relevant family history, was on no regular medications, and denied using illicit drugs.\nOn examination, the patient appeared mildly diaphoretic but was afebrile. Heart rate was irregular, at 92 beats per minute and blood pressure was 118/60 mmHg. He had a normal respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute with oxygen saturations of 98% on room air. Neurological examination revealed symmetrical proximal weakness of upper and lower limbs with normal tone, reflexes, and sensation. The decrease in power was more noticeable in the lower limbs compared to the upper limbs. In addition, there was a mildly enlarged painless thyroid gland, with a slight hand tremor, but no signs of thyroid acropachy or thyroid eye disease. Heart sounds were normal with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, and lung fields were clear to auscultation and percussion. There was no abdominal tenderness to palpation.\nBedside electrocardiogram revealed atrial flutter with a variable ventricular rate. Initial biochemistry showed hypokalaemia with potassium of 2.3 mmol/L (reference range: 3.5\u20135.2 mmol/L) and hypomagnesaemia with magnesium of 0.59 mmol/L (reference range: 0.70\u20131.10 mmol/L). Plasma glucose level was 7.1 mmol/L. Complete blood count, urea and creatinine, liver function, phosphate, and creatinine kinase were unremarkable.\nHypokalaemic periodic paralysis was suspected and thyroid function testing was performed. This revealed hyperthyroidism with a TSH of <0.01 mU/L (reference range: 0.40\u20134.00 mU/L), T4 of 44 pmol/L (reference range: 9\u201319 pmol/L), and T3 of 25 pmol/L (reference range: 3.0\u20135.5 pmol/L), suggesting a diagnosis of TPP. TSH receptor antibodies were elevated at >40 U/L (reference range: <1.8 U/L), confirming a diagnosis of Graves' disease. This was further supported by a radionuclide thyroid scan showing diffuse uptake in the thyroid gland. Antithyroperoxidase antibodies, antithyroglobulin antibodies, and urinary electrolytes were not measured in this case.\nInitial treatment in the emergency department included 40 mmol of intravenous KCl and 10 mmol of intravenous MgSO4. The patient's weakness resolved during inpatient admission. Potassium was 4.7 mmol/L and magnesium was 0.88 mmol/L on repeat testing 6 hours after the initial biochemical tests. Thereafter, potassium remained normal throughout the admission, without rebound hyperkalaemia or the need for further replacement. The patient was discharged home the next day on Carbimazole 20 mg twice a day and Propranolol 20 mg three times a day. No potassium supplementation was prescribed on discharge and he was not started on anticoagulation for the atrial flutter due to his low risk of thromboembolism.\nOne month after discharge, the patient reported no further episodes of weakness. His T4 and T3 had normalised, although TSH remained at <0.01 mU/L. His potassium was normal at 4.1 mmol/L. Ongoing monitoring of thyroid function was recommended, with a plan for radioiodine ablation or thyroid surgery if antithyroid medical therapy was unsuccessful.

Laboratory data on the admission date showed leukocytosis (WBC, 15,820/mm3; promyelocyte, 66%, with Auer rod), anemia (Hb, 9.5 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (PLT, 22,000/mm3), and abnormal coagulation profile (fibrinogen, 29 mg/dL; fibrin degradation product (FDP), 68.5 mcg/mL; d-dimer, 19.81 mcg/mL; prothrombin time (PT), 20.5 sec; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.92; partial thromboplastin time (PTT), 29 sec). Other laboratory data were as follows: C-reactive protein (CRP), 8.97 mg/dL; total bilirubin (T-bil), 0.73 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 60 U/L; alanine transferase (ALT), 100 U/L; and serum creatinine (Scr), 0.9 mg/dL. His baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal (). Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy disclosed APL with PML-RAR\u03b1. ATRA at a dose of 45 mg/m2/day (40 mg twice daily) was administered. On the third day of therapy, oxygen saturation abruptly dropped to 90% without oxygen supplementation. Chest X-ray (CXR), ECG, and echocardiography did not show any abnormalities. In order to prevent DS, intravenous methylprednisolone was administered at a daily dose of 80 mg\u2013120 mg according to the clinical signs and symptoms. Idarubicin (12 mg/m2/dose) was administered starting on the fourth day for four doses. WBC progressively elevated to 46,830/mm3; therefore, 1000 mg hydroxyurea twice daily was also added starting on the seventh day.\nOn the 11th day of therapy, WBC and promyelocyte decreased to 6,310/mm3 and 14%, respectively. ATO infusion at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg was initiated; however, dizziness and chest pain occurred during infusion. ECG showed complete AV block with a heart rate (HR) of 40\u201350 beats/min (bpm) (). The electrolytes and liver function tests were all within normal limits (Na, 138 mmol/L; K, 4.6 mmol/L; Ca, 2.29 mmol/L; Mg, 0.95 mmol/L; T-bil, 0.77 mg/dL; AST, 15 U/L; ALT, 14 U/L). Thus, ATO and ATRA were immediately discontinued, and aminophylline was administered.\nAfter interruption of ATRA for three doses, complete AV block persisted, but his HR partially recovered to 60 bpm. ATRA was rechallenged with 40 mg once daily on the 13th day of therapy under relatively stable vital signs. On the following morning, his HR decreased to 30 bpm and he required a nonrebreathing mask to maintain oxygen saturation. CXR showed bilateral pulmonary edema, and echocardiogram revealed a large amount of pericardial effusion with signs of cardiac tamponade. In addition, ECG showed complete AV block with QRS widening, and acute renal failure also occurred (Scr, 1.4 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 45.2 mg/dL; Na, 133 mmol/L; K, 5.2 mmol/L; Ca, 2.22 mmol/L; Mg, 0.93 mmol/L; P, 4.9 mg/dL; T-bil, 1.22 mg/dL; ALT, 17 U/L). Therefore, ARTA was immediately postponed, and a temporary pacemaker was inserted. Steroid treatment was switched to dexamethasone (8 mg twice daily) because of suspected DS. Pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis were performed. Two days after stopping ATRA, ECG showed sinus bradycardia with a first-degree AV block and diffuse ST elevation. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale [] indicated a score of 7 for ATRA, suggesting it was the probable cause of arrhythmia in this episode.\nThe PML-RAR\u03b1 mutant was still detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood sampled on the 19th day of therapy. Consequently, ATRA was resumed the following day with 10 mg twice daily. His HR decreased from 70\u201390 bpm to 60\u201370 bpm with stable vital signs. ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block. The dose of ATRA was gradually titrated up to 30 mg twice daily on the 24th day. Sinus tachycardia with occasional premature ventricular complexes was noted. The pacemaker was removed on the 27th day. During follow-up, ECG showed normal sinus rhythm (), and echocardiogram revealed minimal pericardial effusion.\nComplete molecular remission was documented by bone marrow aspiration done on the 38th day of therapy using flow cytometry and PCR for PML-RAR\u03b1. Thereafter, the patient received three cycles of consolidation with ATRA-based chemotherapy. No further bradycardia episode was reported.

The patient was given 50 mg of oral prednisolone immediately after admission.\nApproximately 3 weeks after the start of treatment, the dosage of prednisolone was reduced to 45 mg/day. However, the patient suddenly developed hemoptysis and respiratory distress. A chest X-ray () revealed infiltrative shadows in both lung fields, with greater density in the right lung. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed pulmonary infiltrates along the peripheral bronchovascular bundles and ground-glass opacities ().

The patient was also transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and placed on mechanical ventilation. Although the patient produced copious quantities of bloody secretions after intubation, the secretions were reduced when APRV was set to the highest airway pressure (35 cmH2O). We administered oxygen through an oxygen mask (flow rate: 6 L/min) while in the ICU. Under these conditions, the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) was 55.1 mmHg, and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F ratio) was 125.2.

There were no signs of scrotal inflammation. The mass had a firm consistency and regular margins. Palpation of his right testis and the lower pole of his left testis were normal. Routine blood tests were normal. As a testicular tumor was strongly suspected, a bioassay of testicular tumor markers was ordered. Alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were in the normal ranges.

{"clinical_note": "The present case involves a 62-year-old woman admitted to surgical oncology unit for a planned transanal excision of a large polyp of the mid rectum. Following a positive faecal occult blood test, colonoscopy detected the presence of a large flat neoplastic lesion, 50 mm in maximum diameter, tending to grow laterally and involving one-third of the rectal lumen (Fig. ). The lesion was located in the mid rectum, 8 cm from the anal verge and, based on its detailed endoscopic appearance during chromoendoscopy, was labelled as a lateral spreading tumour granular type (LTS-G). The endoscopic biopsy demonstrated a tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. In view of the size of the lesion, endoscopic mucosal resection was considered unfeasible and it was decided to proceed with surgical excision transanally by TAMIS. The day before surgery, patient had standard mechanical bowel preparation and at the time of anaesthetic induction received preoperative antibiotics (Cefazolin 2 g and Metronidazole 500 mg). The procedure was performed under general anaesthesia and the single incision laparoscopic surgery port (SILS\u2122 Port, Covidien) was adopted and traditional laparoscopic instruments were used. The surgery lasted 2 h with no intraoperative complications. The rectal wall defect was washed with a povidone-iodine solution (Fig. ) and then closed by a running suture performed with a barbed suture (Covidien V-Loc\u2122).\nPatient had unremarkable past medical history and on admission routine laboratory profile was in normal range: WBC, 6.34 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL (reference value, 4\u201310 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL); platelets, 231 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL (reference value, 150\u2013400 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL); prothrombin time (PT), 11.4 s (reference value, 10.0\u201313.4 s); activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 34 s (reference value, 22.0\u201343.0 s); fibrinogen, 301 mg/dL (reference value, 160\u2013450 mg/dL). Following surgery, the patient was allowed to be mobilised and to have a regular diet with no restriction, and standard prophylaxis for venous thrombosis was started with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).\nOn day 3, the patient developed a spike in temperature without any suspicious clinical evidences. She was passing flatus associated with the mucous discharge, the abdomen was soft and not tender, and digital rectal examination did not show any lump or collection. Laboratory data disclosed both a deranged coagulation profile with marked APTT prolongation (126 s), PT 12.5 s, fibrinogen 897 mg/dL, raised white blood cells count (WBC 21.00 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL) and procalcitonin 0.52 ng/mL (reference value, < 0.5 ng/mL). Cross-mixing studies of patient plasma and normal pooled plasma (25, 50, and 75%) insufficiently corrected the APTT (99, 71, and 56 s, respectively) after 2 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C. Lupus anticoagulant assay was negative by dilute Russel viper venom test (DRVVT). FVIII, FXI, and FIX were in normal range whereas coagulant activity of FXII was < 1%, tested using one-stage APTT-based clotting assay.\nConsidering the spike in temperature and laboratory data, a computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out any collection and source of infection. The CT scan did not show any pelvic abscess, but there was evidence of perirectal fat suffusion related to the recent procedure. A rigid proctoscopy was performed showing the evidence of the partial dehiscence of rectal wall defect suture; no other abnormalities were noticed. Antibiotic therapy was started with intravenous ciprofloxacin and metronidazole (500 mg) three times a day. From a therapeutic point of view, there is a general consensus that patients with an FXII inhibitor do not need any correction of the APTT and so our patient did not receive any therapy in addition to antibiotics. LMWH standard prophylaxis for venous thrombosis, initially suspended, was resumed. In the next 7 days, the patient had no more fever and laboratory data improved while APTT was still prolonged (70 s). She was discharged home with no further intervention. The histopathological report demonstrated a tubular adenoma with low- and high-grade dysplasia with free excision margins. 45 days later endoscopy showed a complete mucosal healing, APTT and FXII activity were back to the normal value (38 s and 50%, respectively).

{"clinical_note": "A 20-year-old male patient was referred to our clinic in December 2017 for acute liver failure (ALF) of unknown origin. History revealed no pre-existing medical conditions, anamnesis was empty for exposition with predisposing agents such as previous drug-use, promiscuity, pork consumption or autoimmune disorders. The initial presentation at the peripheral hospital occurred due to indolent jaundice and fatigue-syndrome. Physical examination of the patient showed distinct jaundice and hepatic encephalopathy grade I. Laboratory studies revealed massively elevated transaminases with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 4645 U/l and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 4956 U/l (normal < 50 U/l) while cholestatic liver enzymes were merely elevated (alkaline phosphatase (AP) 216 (normal 25\u2013124) U/l and gamma-glutamyl-transferase (\u03b3-GT) 91 (normal < 55 U/l)). Furthermore, liver synthesis parameters were significantly impaired with a total bilirubin of 14.8 (normal 0.3\u20131.2) mg/dl, an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.39, and a factor V activity of < 35 (normal 70\u2013120) % with a consecutive MELD score of 28 points. Additionally, there was no serological evidence for autoimmune hepatitis, viral hepatitis (A-E), Wilson\u2019s disease or hemochromatosis. Laboratory parameters on admission are presented in Table . According to the above-mentioned parameters and circumstances, the patient was diagnosed with a cryptgenic ALF and treated supportively by substitution of vitamin K, ursodeoxycholic acid, and lactulose.\nAccordingly, liver maximum capacity (LiMAx) test on admission revealed significant impairment of enzymatic liver function of 147 (normal > 315) \u03bcg/h/kg. Two days later, laboratory parameters further deteriorated: the patient now fulfilled the KCC for non-acetaminophen-induced ALF ((1) unknown etiology; (2) INR > 3.5; (3) bilirubin > 17.4 mg/dl), and he was considered for urgent liver transplantation at Eurotransplant. Three days later, the patient became anuric and hemodialysis was necessary with a MELD score of 40 points. However, a suitable donor organ was not available. Two days later, the patient developed hepatic encephalopathy grade III-IV accompanied by increasing inflammatory parameters in blood (increase of leukocytes, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin) and respiratory insufficiency, which made mechanical ventilation necessary. Computed tomography scan revealed bilateral pneumonia and antibiotic (imipenem) and antifungal (caspofungin) therapy was initiated (Fig. ). Bloodstream infection with evidence of Staphylococcus aureus was ascertained concurrently. Due to pulmonary Staphylococcus aureus sepsis the patient was no longer suitable for urgent LT at that critical juncture.\nInterestingly, LiMAx test, which was performed under mechanical ventilation, showed an improvement of enzymatic liver function to 169 \u03bcg/h/kg indicating liver regeneration, though laboratory tests (deterioration of conventional liver synthesis parameters, rapid increase of inflammatory parameters in blood) and clinical course (multi-organ system failure: liver and renal insufficiency, encephalopathy, sepsis due to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia) indicated lethal outcome. However, from then on, clinical condition of the patient improved, inflammatory parameters were declining, urine excretion resumed, and extubation was possible after 6 days of mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, CT scan showed regressive pulmonary infiltrations (Fig. ). Slowly, with significant time delay of 11 days, liver synthesis parameters recovered, and the patient could be moved out from the intensive care unit after 21 days of treatment. At that time point, the LiMAx test demonstrated distinct improvement to 299 \u03bcg/h/kg. The following mini-laparoscopy revealed cholestatic changes of liver parenchyma with regenerative nodules and capsular fibrosis (Fig. ). Histopathology of the obtained liver biopsy illustrated advanced connective tissue of the parenchyma in sense of septal fibrosis (F3) accompanied by severe cholestatic liver damage without evidence for precise etiological correlation (Fig. ).\nFinally, the patient could be dismissed from our clinic in markedly ameliorated condition after 38 days. Outpatient three-month follow-up examination showed complete clinical recovery while biochemical parameters were entirely within normal ranges (AST: 21 U/l, ALT: 34 U/l, total bilirubin 0.4 mg/dl, INR: 1.07, MELD score: 7). Accordingly, LiMAx illustrated complete restitution of enzymatic liver function with a value of 614 \u03bcg/h/kg (normal > 315 \u03bcg/h/kg).

The pH-metry confirmed gastroesophageal reflux, ECG and CMCRF were normal. The neurologist described a mild hypertonus and related mild motor delay. He sat independently at 9 months of age and he started walking at 20 months of age. The parents noted shortness of breath and tiredness after simple physical tasks, therefore, he was evaluated by a paediatric cardiologist. Two haemodynamically significant ASDs were noted and a slightly dilated right ventricle; corrective surgery is planned. The tests of acylcarnitine profiles and aminoacids in blood and organic acid in urine were normal. At the age of four his height and weight were in the normal range (height 99.2 cm (17P), weight 16.1 kg (46P)), however, the head circumference showed macrocephaly - 53.8 cm (>97P).\nMicroarray analysis (180 K CGH array, Agilent Technologies- Fig. ) revealed a de novo microduplication of 2.06 Mb in chromosome 2p16.1p15 region (arr[GRCh37] 2p16.1p15(60308869_62368583)\u00d7 3 dn).

{"clinical_note": "The patient is a 43-year-old woman who was admitted for the first time for a progressive non-painful, mobile mass of the right inguinal fold evolving for 7 months. The medical history of the patient included childhood asthma, chronic tonsillitis, seven pregnancies and four children, caesarean section and abortions. Pelvic ultrasound showed a heterogeneous suspicious non-circumscribed mass measuring 5 cm in its longer axis. It was localised in the right inguinal region and showed cutaneous adhesions. CT scan confirmed the presence of this inguinal mass, measuring 5.8 \u00d7 4.9 \u00d7 3.2 cm and extending within the right femoral triangle in contact with the long adductor muscle, without enhanced contrast, and without locoregional lymph node (Fig. ).\nThe patient underwent a chirurgical biopsy. The pathological analysis diagnosed a granular cell tumor (Abrikossoff\u2019s tumor) without any malignant signs (absence of mitosis, necrosis and cytonuclear atypias). Tumorectomy of this inguinal mass were performed three weeks later. At the gross pathology examination, the tumoral tissue was homogeneous with a greyish stain. Its margin was not well defined and the hypodermic, dermic were involved. One lymph node was discovered and was invaded. The epidermis was not ulcerated (Fig. ). Histologically, collagen bundles were infiltrated by cords of large, polygonal cells with inconspicuous cell membrane and homogenous finely granular cytoplasm. Nuclei were round or oval and presented large nucleoli, vesicular of dark chromatin and sometime an intranuclear vacuole. Mitosis were rare and the mitotic index was low (1 mitosis/ 10 High Power Field). There was a slight increase of the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. We observed no necrosis (Fig. ). Fanburg-Smith score of malignancy was of 3: nuclear pleomorphism, tumor cell spindling, vesicular nuclei with large nucleoli. Immunohistological finding showed a cell expression of S-100 protein, vimentin, calretinin (slight), \u03b1-Inhibin, CD56, CD57, CD68 and neuron specific enolase (NSE). (Fig. ) Cytokeratin AE1-AE3, EMA, calponin, caldesmon, desmin, smooth muscle actine, myosin, myogenin, chromogranin, synaptphysin, Neurofilament proteins, Glial fibrillary acidic protein, CD1a, renal cell carcinoma antibodies were all negative. Therapeutic marker, estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, androgen receptor, HER2, CD117 ALK, C-MET, ROS1 and PDL-1 were negative too.\nDue to microscopic resection and the nodal status, a large surgical revision with an inguinal curage was then decided at the oncology committee. Pathological evaluation did not reveal tumor tissue in the tumorectomy region but showed metastatic invasion by granular cells in four of twelve lymph nodes, without capsular rupture. Adjuvant chemotherapy was excluded because of very low mitotic activity. To reduce the risk of local recurrence, adjuvant radiotherapy on the tumor bed and right inguinal area of \u200b\u200b50 Gy in conventional fractionation was delivered. After 10 months after the end of radiotherapy, the patient is in complete remission.

{"clinical_note": "Patient: a 9-year, 7-month-old Japanese girl (height 127 cm, body weight 33 kg, body mass index 20.5 kg/m2).\nPrimary complaint: severe deformity of the femur.\nPast medical history: no notable history.\nThe patient was referred to our facility with complaints of progressive deformity of her right femur associated with an SBC and pathological fractures. The girl experienced a pathological fracture of her right femur due to bone tumor when she was 4-years, 6-months old (Fig. ), which her previous physician treated with lesion curettage and fixation (Fig. ). Pathological findings confirmed the presence of an SBC. Bone healing was confirmed 6 months later, at the age of 5 years. The fixator was removed and steroids were injected simultaneously with an artificial bone graft into the lesion (Fig. ). She wore a functional brace after the surgery. However, 1 week after removing the fixator, a new fracture developed in the same location of the bone, following a minor external injury (Fig. ). After a 5-week trial of conservative treatment using steel wire skeletal traction, she underwent fixation with application of a hip spica cast. Five months after the second fracture, at the age of 5 years and 5 months, weight-bearing on the affected limb was progressively initiated, and she was discharged with full weight-bearing status at the age of 5 years and 7 months. She was monitored as an out-patient (Fig. ).\nSubsequently, she developed a fracture again at the age of 6 years and 4 months, following a fall (Fig. ). She was once again treated with a steel wire skeletal traction. Once bone healing was achieved, the inside of the cyst was curetted and a cannulated screw was inserted to reduce localized pressure (Fig. ). Approximately 6 weeks after surgery, a hip spica cast was applied, which was followed by the use of a functional brace. During the follow-up period, severe bowing of her right femur developed, which was progressive (Fig. ). At the age of 9 years and 6 months, the femur fractured, with the fracture originating at the cannulated screw. The screw was subsequently removed (Fig. ) and the patient was referred to our facility at the age of 9 years and 7 months.\nOn first examination at our facility, the femur was deformed, with a bowing of approximately 90\u00b0 in the central area of the femur and an internal rotation of 60\u00b0, with incomplete fractures observable in the same area (Fig. ). We proceeded with resection of a 7-cm portion of the bone, which included the SBC, corrected the alignment and applied an Ilizarov fixator to gradually lengthen the thigh. We also cut a portion of healthy bone from the proximal femur (approximately 10 cm from resected lesion), for use as bone extension at the site of resection (Fig. ). One week after surgery, extension of the bone was initiated at a speed of 1 mm/day, completing the process in 4 months. Fixation was then maintained until the callus matured (Fig. ). Once callus maturation was achieved, the external fixator was gradually removed to prevent re-deformation.\nOn histopathologic examination of the surgically resected bone, fibrillation of the medullary cavity was increased, and a small formation, identified as inorganic-like material, was scattered throughout; these findings were consistent with a fracture due to a bone cyst (Fig. ).\nAt present, 3 years after surgery, correction of the deformity has been maintained, and our patient does not experience any limitations in daily activities or regular exercise (Fig. ).", "topic_list": "['underlying processes/pathways', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'recognizes associated conditions of a disease', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}

As part of our ongoing study \u201cVaginal delivery after caesarean section\u201d, she underwent saline contrast sonohysterography 6 months after the caesarean section. The caesarean scar had a small indentation and the remaining myometrium over the defect was 7.5 mm (Fig. ).\nIn the current pregnancy, she had a dating scan at around 11 weeks with no remarks. She came for a transvaginal ultrasound examination at around 13 weeks as part of our study. This scan revealed a duplex pregnancy with one viable intrauterine fetus with normal anatomy and placenta located high on the anterior wall and a small gestational sac (8 mm) with a yolk sac without embryo was located in the caesarean scar (Fig. ). There was no extensive vascularity surrounding the sac. One corpus luteum was found in each of the two ovaries. She was asymptomatic.\nShe was informed that not enough evidence existed to advise a specific management of this condition. After discussion with her and her husband, expectant management was chosen with a new ultrasound examination after 5 weeks.\nShe came to our ultrasound department at 18 weeks, 22 weeks, and 30 weeks of gestation. She remained asymptomatic. The ectopic gestational sac was not visualized with transvaginal or transabdominal scans at the 18 weeks examination (Fig. ). The niche in the scar and the thickness of the thinnest part of the remaining myometrium appeared unchanged at all visits. The intrauterine pregnancy developed normally with no signs of abnormal placentation. At 30 weeks of gestation the ultrasound appearance of the scar area did not indicate any contraindications for vaginal delivery. The thickness of the lower uterine segment (LUS) was 4.9 mm (Fig. ). In agreement with our patient, vaginal delivery was planned. The staff of the labor ward was fully informed.\nShe was admitted to the labor ward with irregular contractions in week 37 + 0. Her cervix dilated to 3 cm with no further progress. Due to that oxytocin augmentation was administered for 3 hours. The duration of active labor was 6.5 hours.

{"clinical_note": "The patient was a healthy 25-year-old man with a one-year history of right ankle pain following trauma.\nHe had met a car accident while walking. One year earlier, he had undergone open reduction and internal fixation on his right ankle for fracture at another hospital. A tibia diaphysis spiral fracture was fixed by the anterograde intramedullary nail with infra-patellar approach. An ankle malleolar fracture was fixed by the locking plate and cannulated cancellous screws with direct lateral and medial approach. He had finally consulted us because of worsening ankle pain while walking. On physical examination, there was tenderness in the anteromedial joint space of the right ankle. Slight ankle swelling was noted. Dorsiflexion of the right ankle was 10\u00b0, similar to that of the left ankle, but plantarflexion was restricted to 38\u00b0, compared with 60\u00b0 on the left, but the ankle instability test was negative.\nThe first three months, even though we performed intra-articular injections, arthroscopic synovectomy for osteoarthritis, and the fixation implant removal in order to release implant irritation, his ankle pain persisted.\nThe AOFAS ankle score at that point in time was 50 . Radiographs showed moderate narrowing of the ankle joint and forward displacement of the talus (-A, B). Computed tomography of the right ankle showed an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond (). This was diagnosed as progressive osteoarthritis caused by an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond, and surgical repair of the osteochondral defect was recommended. Three months later, the osteochondral graft was performed on the patient's right ankle. The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia. The lower extremity was prepared and draped in the standard sterile fashion. We inserted the 2.0 mm K-wire in his right calcaneus, then skeletal traction was done in order to open his right ankle joint space if necessary. Next, 10 mL of fluid was injected intra-articularly to distend the ankle. The anterolateral ankle arthroscopy portal was established in the routine fashion, and global arthroscopy was performed. The osteochondral defect was identified about the anterolateral plafond which site was enthesis of the anterior tibiofibular ligament (), and osteochondral lesions of the tibia and talus were identified. An anteromedial portal was established. The osteochondral lesions were probed, and the osteochondral lesions were diagnosed as grade 2 according to the classification of the International Cartilage Repair Society . We performed multiple OAT in the anterolateral plafond at the anterolateral wall with extension of the anterolateral portal. The anterolateral osteochondral defect was measured 9 mm \u00d7 20 mm (). The plug donor site was the lateral corner of the patellar groove in the right knee joint. Under direct vision, we harvested 2 bone plugs from the normal bone deeper than the osteochondral defect for the preparation of the recipient site in order to accept the osteochondral plugs from the donor site in maximum plantarflexion. Then, the dilator was interpositioned into the recipient site, and a radiograph was taken to calculate the inclination angle between the dilator and tibial plafond. Therefore, we thought that the smooth surface was obtained by the inclination of the grafted plugs. According to the angle required, two 8-mm osteochondral autograft plugs ramped 35\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 were harvested from the donor site (), and transferred into the anterolateral plafond at an angle to re-contour the articular surface and make it smooth. Both harvest and transplantation of osteochondral autograft plugs were performed by open approaches for transplantation in the exact slope. After this procedure, the surface of the anterolateral wall of plafond was almost completely smooth (). The depth of these plugs was 20 mm, deeper than the osteochondral defect. It was confirmed that the deepest area of the plugs consisted of a macroscopically normal bone. We used press-fit technique in order to stabilize the osteochondral plugs. Stabilization of the osteochondral fragments relied on tight interference with the host bone. In case of difficulty with press-fit technique, a screw made of polylactic acid and hydroxyapatite was prepared, but it was never used.\nPostoperatively, the foot was placed in a short leg cast, and the patient was advised to ambulate non-weightbearing for a 4-week period. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and a range of motion exercises were initiated immediately after cast removal at 4 weeks, with partial progressive weightbearing allowed during the next 4 weeks. The patient was able to return to standing work 10 months after surgery. The most recent magnetic resonance imaging scans at 2 years after surgery showed that the cartilage in the anterolateral joint surface was almost intact, and there was no osteonecrosis (). At 3 years the post-operative X-rays of the ankle joint depicted a larger osteophyte, compared with the pre-operative situation, in the anterolateral corner of the right tibial plafond. No forward displacement of the talus was evident on the lateral view of the right ankle joint, while the respective joint space was preserved (). On the latest physical examination, the patient complained of mild pain in his right ankle while walking, but could walk for 30 min. Dorsiflexion of the right ankle was 0\u00b0, compared with 10\u00b0 on the left, and plantarflexion was 30\u00b0, compared with 60\u00b0 on the left. The postoperative AOFAS ankle score was 80. The patient remained asymptomatic with respect to the donor sites of the right knee. He was able to return to carpenter's work on a five-day week, but remained with minor ankle pain on standing up and walking for more than half an hour over the 3-year observation period.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

He was admitted to the intensive care unit for supportive care including pantoprazole infusion, blood transfusion and close monitoring. CT scan of the abdomen revealed a complex pancreatic mass representing a bleeding pancreatic pseudocyst with an interval increase in size when compared with the previous CT scans (Figure ).\nThe patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)/endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) which showed submucosal bulging likely from extrinsic compression on the proximal gastric body and fundus with small clean-based ulcer on the top of this bulge (Figure ). No fresh or old blood was noted in the stomach, and the esophagus and duodenum both appeared normal. EUS confirmed the presence of anechoic lesion with hyperechoic shadowing suggestive of cyst/pseudocyst with bleeding located in the tail of the pancreas.

{"clinical_note": "A 73-year-old white man presented to our emergency department with a 3-day history of left lower extremity swelling and acute-onset shortness of breath. On evaluation, he was tachycardic with a pulse of 113, hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 130-170 mmHg, and demonstrated poor oxygen saturation of 81% on room air. He was supported with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and supplemental oxygen while a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was obtained, which revealed a saddle PE (Fig. ).\nTissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered and he was started on a heparin infusion and admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) for management. He remained on the heparin infusion for 3 days, during which he continuously improved and was eventually weaned to 3 L oxygen via nasal cannula. On hospital day 2, he was transferred to intermediate level of care. Per hematology recommendations, he would have to be on indefinite anticoagulation due to the massive PE he had sustained, the source of which was a left lower extremity popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The plan was to transition him from the heparin infusion to enoxaparin twice per day with hematology follow-up in 1 month.\nOn the day of discharge, however, he had sudden onset of right leg numbness and weakness below the level of his hip. He had previously been working with physical therapy and had been able to walk 200 feet with the assistance of a walker during each session. A physical examination revealed decreased sensation to light touch, 2/5 strength in right hip flexion and right knee extension and flexion, and loss of right patellar reflex. Left leg physical examination was normal at that time.\nAn emergent head computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered due to concern for a possible stroke, and neurology was consulted. The head CT was negative for infarction or hemorrhage. Neurology was concerned for spinal cord infarction versus hematoma and recommended emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his thoracic and lumbar spine. The MRI revealed a left psoas hematoma (Fig. ). A CT of his pelvis performed the same day also showed a right psoas and iliacus hematoma. Due to these findings, hematology recommended discontinuing enoxaparin and reverting to a low intensity heparin infusion, as well as placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The following day his left leg began exhibiting the same symptoms as his right leg. There was concern regarding the risk of progressive and irreversible nerve damage due to compression if the hematomas were not promptly drained. IR was consulted and advised that if the drainage were to occur while our patient was on anticoagulation, the risk of rebleeding into the retroperitoneum would be high and potentially nullify any benefit from drainage. Our patient would also be at risk of hemodynamic instability if the current hematomas were acting as tamponades against further bleeding. An additional complicating factor was the risk of further thrombosis due to the presenting saddle PE. Hematology was consulted for recommendations on pausing anticoagulation, but they were hesitant to offer a timeframe as there was no established safe period to enable this type of procedure to take place. Eventually, a window period of pausing the heparin infusion for 3 hours pre-procedure and up to 6 hours post-procedure was decided upon in the event that our patient agreed to have the drainage performed.\nThroughout this sequence of events, our patient and his wife were aware of the plans and considerations on how to proceed. They were informed of the recommendations and concerns made by neurology, hematology, and IR, as well as the risks and benefits of intervention versus non-intervention.\nAfter speaking with his wife, our patient decided to undergo the procedure. The low intensity heparin infusion was stopped 3 hours beforehand and the IR team then performed drainage of the right retroperitoneal hematoma, placing two pigtail catheters in our patient\u2019s right flank (Fig. ). In total, the hematoma was drained of 215 milliliters of blood, 10 milliliters of which were drained during the procedure itself. The left psoas hematoma was not found to be amenable to drainage.\nOur patient tolerated the procedure well, and the heparin infusion was restarted 6 hours after it was completed. A repeat neurological examination demonstrated improved lower extremity strength bilaterally as well as the return of sensation to light touch. Hip flexion improved to 3/5 bilaterally, and knee flexion and extension improved to 4/5 bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes remained absent. Four days later, the pigtail catheters were removed. His recovery was complicated by anemia requiring blood transfusions totaling 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Other sources of potential bleeding were evaluated and not found. A repeat CT on hospital day 10 (Fig. ) showed a stable right-sided hematoma, and our patient did not experience any further neurologic deficits. He was transitioned again from the heparin infusion to enoxaparin after 3 more days. His hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable. During this time, he worked with physical therapy, who recommended discharge to a skilled nursing facility where his strength began to improve somewhat. Follow-up was scheduled with neurology and hematology.

Cranial nerve examination demonstrated bilateral delayed pupillary light reflex (PLR) and normal pupil size, the remainder of the neurological examination was within normal limits.\nA right-sided frontal bone depression fracture was suspected founded on clinical findings. Radiographs and Computer Tomography (CT) imaging with a three-dimensional reconstruction of the skull were performed under general anaesthesia (see Fig. -). Radiographs of the cervical spine were unremarkable.\nCT imaging revealed a comminuted, depressed fracture of the frontal bone that extended from the level of the maxillary recesses up to the caudal aspect of the frontal sinuses at the level of the dorsal aspect of the right maxillary, nasal and frontal bones. Surgical repair of the defect was warranted to reestablish sinus architecture and mechanical stability []. Further, fracture comminution is associated with soft tissue contracture leading to cavitation with connective tissue scarring and sequestrum formation [], fracture repair addresses soft tissue injury and may minimize long-term risks of complication []. Surgery was carried out three days after admission.\nA standard dorsal approach to the frontal bone was taken (Fig. -). A malleable highly porous Ti mesh (0.2 mm thickness with 1.4 mm by 0.6 mm elongated pores) was contoured to the patient\u2019s skull (Fig. -).\nThe Ti mesh was firmly seated against the skull and a 1.6 mm drill bit, with a 6 mm stop, was used to drill pilot holes through the mesh into the skull. A 2.1 mm diameter resorbable poly-L, D-lactic acid (PLDLA) thermoplastic pin was placed into the pilot hole and the ultrasonic trode applied to the proximal end of the pin (Fig. -). The ultrasonic device was activated melting the outer surface of the pin and allowing it to be advanced into the pilot hole. Further pilot holes were drilled around the periphery of the Ti mesh at 20-25 mm intervals and thermoplastic pins inserted until the Ti mesh was adequately secured.\nThe surgical site was flushed with copious volumes of sterile saline and a sheet of gentamycin-impregnated collagen (Collatamp\u00ae, EusaPharma) was overlaid on the implant to prevent infection and assist in achieving a pneumatic seal. Prophylactic intravenous antibiotic cover was provided by clavulanated amoxicillin (20 mg/kg; Augmentin, GSK) given 30 min pre-operatively and every 90 min thereafter for surgery duration. Recovery from anaesthesia was uneventful. Post-operative analgesia was provided with intravenous methadone (0.2 mg/kg q4hours; Comfortan, Dechra). Postoperative radiographs and CT images showed satisfactory positioning of the Ti mesh and adequate coverage of the calvarial defect (Fig. -).\nThe dog was discharged two days after surgery with a 10 day course of oral carprofen (2 mg/kg q24hours; Rimadyl, Zoetis) and oral clavulanic acid-amoxicillin (20 mg/kg q12h; Synulox, Zoetis).\nThe dog re-presented two weeks after discharge, with hyperthermia and swelling around the surgical site. Subcutaneous oedema was present in the absence of emphysema. Sampling for culture and sensitivity was prevented by the absence of nasal and surgical site discharge, exposure of the wound to obtain a swab sample was deemed inappropriate. Antibiotic therapy effective against common nasal pathogens [] was introduced with oral cefalexin (20 mg/kg q 12 hours; Therios, Ceva) for ten days. Clinical signs had resolved at 1 week post treatment.\nAt the six weeks recheck, the physical examination was within normal limits. No pain was elicited upon palpation of the surgical site and no indications of infection recurrence was found. Radiographs and CT of the skull revealed a slight uplift of the mesh at its most rostral aspect from the frontal bone. Mesh uplift was not a clinical concern at this stage. Radiographs and CT scan at 6 months revealed soft tissue swelling between the rostral mesh portion and the skull (see Fig. -). Decision was made to trim and re-contour the uplifted mesh. The procedure and recovery were uneventful and no further complications were experienced.\nAt 2 years assessment, radiographs and CT scan confirmed adequate contouring and positioning of the Ti mesh. Radiographs revealed a bone-dense opacity between the rostral part of the mesh and the skull potentially associated with mesh micromotion stimulating periosteal reaction (Fig. -). The degree of new bone formation around the mesh periphery was difficult to ascertain radiographically, however, clinical examination was unremarkable and cosmetic result was satisfactory.

{"clinical_note": "A ten-year-old neutered female Cavalier King Charles Spaniel presented for a gradually enlarging mass on the right frontal bone with no associated clinical signs. The mass was bone-like and non-painful upon palpation. The remainder of clinical examination was within normal limits. Fine needle aspirates of the mass revealed evidence of bone remodeling compatible with a neoplastic process yet were not diagnostic, further investigation was declined and mass excision by surgery was planned. Radiography and CT imaging of the skull were performed under general anaesthesia to advise surgical planning and custom 3D Ti mesh design for use in reconstruction following tumour resection. Thoracic and abdominal CT scan were also taken for staging and were negative for metastatic disease. CT imaging of the skull revealed a 25 mm (h) \u00d7 20 mm (diam.) ovoid mass arising from the right frontal bone above the right orbital globe (see Fig. -). Surgery was implemented a week later.\nThe same surgical approach was performed (Fig. -). A craniotomy with resection margins guided by the use of customised template was performed (Fig. -). The resection guide was computer modelled from CT imaging and printed using a sterolithographic system. A pre-contoured Ti mesh aided by computer modeling and computed manufacture was firmly seated to the patient\u2019s skull covering the defect (see Fig. -). The protocol for thermoplastic pin placement and application of gentamycin-impregnated collagen sheet was as described for patient 1. Non-resorbable methacrylate-butadiene-styrol (MBS) pins were used in case 2 for fixation in contrast to resorbable PLDLA described in case 1.\nProphylactic intravenous antibiotic cover was provided by cefuroxime (20 mg/kg; Zinacef, GSK) given 30 min pre-operatively and every 90 min thereafter for surgery duration. Recovery from anaesthesia was uneventful. Post-operative analgesia was provided with intravenous methadone (0.2 mg/kg q 4 h) and in travenous paracetamol (10 mg/kg q12hours; Perfalgan, BristolMyers squibb). Postoperative radiographs and CT images showed satisfactory positioning of the Ti mesh and adequate coverage of the calvarial defect (Fig. -). The dog was discharged six days after surgery after uneventful hospitalisation.\nThe dog re-presented two weeks after discharge for suture removal. Surgical wound has healed and physical examination was within normal limits. At the ten weeks recheck, physical examination was within normal limits and the owner reporting no restrictions on the patient\u2019s activity. There was no pain elicited upon surgical site palpation. Radiographs and CT of the skull revealed satisfactory positioning of the mesh. A histological diagnosis of multilobular osteochondrosarcoma was made with potential of local recurrence advised.\nAt 7 months assessment, owners reported a small bone-like mass near the resection site. This clinical finding was consistent with either local recurrence or reactive osseus proliferation. CT scan identified the region of proliferation as dorsal and to the right side of the Ti mesh. The mesh remained well localised and confluent with the skull. The remaining clinical examination was unremarkable and cosmetic result was satisfactory.

{"clinical_note": "A 44-year old male was referred following investigation for chest pain and dyspnoea. He had no pre-existing co-morbidities. Physical examination revealed feeble femoral pulses and he was found to be hypertensive with marked differences between the upper and lower limbs (systolic blood pressure upper limb 190mmmHg, lower limb 75 mmHg, with an ankle brachial index (ABI) of 0.39). Electrocardiogram revealed evidence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy. This was confirmed with echocardiography which also demonstrated a tricuspid aortic valve with significant aortic regurgitation in the presence of an aortic root aneurysm of approximately 9 cm. Left ventricular function was preserved. Computerised tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to evaluate the aortic pathology in further detail (Fig. ). The scan noted an aortic root aneurysm (8.8 cm), in addition to the presence of severe aortic coarctation, with subtotal occlusion and a lumen less than 6 mm in size. The coarctation was just distal to the left subclavian artery, at the aortic isthmus. There was clear evidence of collateral circulation to the descending thoracic aorta via the subclavian and intercostal arteries. Coronary angiography confirmed a right dominant coronary system with no significant coronary disease.\nA multidisciplinary team meeting took place and a consensus was agreed to proceed with a two staged hybrid approach, with the first phase involving an endovascular approach to stent the coarctation, followed by a second stage to perform the surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm. The first stage to stent the coarctation was unsuccessful via the femoral approach, as the guidewire could not cross the coarctation. Assessment through angiography via the left brachial artery showed complete obstruction at the aortic isthmus. The decision was then made to proceed to a single stage surgical approach to treat both lesions.\nAfter induction of anaesthesia, arterial lines were placed in the left radial and left femoral artery. A right infraclavicular incision and a right groin incision was made this was to establish peripheral arterial cannulation access to the right axillary and right femoral artery. An 8 mm dacron graft was anastomosed to each vessel for indirect cannulation. Median sternotomy was performed to access the mediastinum and expose the heart and aorta. Following heparinisation cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established with venous return from bi-caval cannulation. The body temperature was cooled to 25 degrees Celsius. The right superior pulmonary vein was used for venting. Once the cross clamp was applied, complete cardiac arrest was achieved using Custodiol 25 ml/kg crystalloid cardioplegia via a retrograde cannula through the coronary sinus. A further top up of cardioplegia was given once the aorta was opened through direct cannulation of the coronary ostia.\nThe aortic root, valve and ascending aorta were excised. The coronary ostia were fashioned as buttons from the native aortic root. The coronary ostia were noted to be significantly displaced, with distorted anatomy due to the patient\u2019s disease process. Therefore, 8 mm dacron grafts were attached end-to-end to each ostia, with view to performing the modified Cabrol technique later following replacement of the root. The heart was then retracted in a cephalad position to access the posterior pericardium. A vertical incision was made to expose the descending thoracic aorta (DTA). An end to side anastomosis was formed with a 20 mm dacron graft to the DTA (Fig. ). This graft was then routed posterior to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and anterior to the right inferior pulmonary vein (RIPV), adjacent to the right atrium (RA). Root replacement was then performed with a 25 mm biological valved-conduit, as this was favoured by the patient over a mechanical prosthesis, despite the risk of a difficult redo procedure in the future. The 8 mm dacron grafts attached to the coronary ostia were anastmosed to the root conduit as neo coronary ostia. The distal part of the valved-conduit was anastomosed to the proximal arch under selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP). Finally, an end to side anastomosis was fashioned between the 20 mm extra-cardiac graft (attached to the descending thoracic aorta) and the ascending portion of the valved-conduit. Valve-sparing root replacement was not considered in this patient due to the grossly abnormal aortic anatomy.\nFollowing rewarming and deairing the patient was successfully weaned off CPB. The bypass time was 160 min, the cross-clamp time was 120 min, and the SACP time was 40 min. Haemostasis was achieved and thereafter a routine closure of all incision sites. The patient remained in ICU for less than 48 h, and made excellent progress on the ward. Minimal anti-hypertensives were required and the patient was discharged on 8th day post operatively neurologically intact and independent. At 3 months follow up the patient underwent a repeat CTA scan which showed complete patency in the extra-anatomical graft and resolution of the collateral arterial network (Fig. ).", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 25-year-old woman was hospitalized due to frequent premature ventricular beats of high grade (17,000 per day) and repeated episodes of bidirectional non-sustained ventricular tachycardia without syncope.

{"clinical_note": "The patient, a 52-year-old female, was admitted to the department of gastrointestinal surgery of Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute in September, 2016, due to space-occupying lesions in the colon found by colonoscopy during medical examination 2 weeks before. Histopathological examination of endoscopic biopsy specimens indicated moderately differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma. Contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CT) of her abdomen demonstrated that the intestinal wall was thickened about 14 mm in the transverse colon, and several small lymph nodes (7 mm) scattered around the intestine were detected (Fig. and ). Laboratory examination revealed that the levels of CEA and CA72.4 increased to 15.17 ng/ml and 20.88 U/ml respectively. Laparoscopic examination confirmed the tumor (6 cm \u00d7 5 cm) was located in the hepatic flexure of the colon (Fig. and ).\nThe patient (III7) had no other major medical history, except a family history of colon cancer in 3 out of 5 first-degree relatives (mother II2; sister, III5; brother, III6). In particular, the patient\u2019s mother (II2) was diagnosed two separate primary colon cancer at the age 54 and 61 at different sites. Her sister (III5) was diagnosed with endometrial cancer and colon cancer at the age of 54 and 61 respectively (Fig. ). The patient was referred to our cancer genetic counseling clinic for LS genetic testing. Based on Amsterdam II criteria, the proband was diagnosed with LS.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, all affected individuals (III5, 6 and 7) underwent genetic testing of a 101-gene panel by next generation sequencing. Peripheral blood was collected to extract genomic DNA (gDNA). The gDNA was then used to generate libraries according to the protocols suggested by Illumina. A custom targeted capture kit, covering all exons of the 101 genes, was designed (Agilent Technologies, Additional file : Table S1) []. Qualified libraries were subsequently sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform with 2 \u00d7 150 bp configuration. Reads were aligned to the reference human genome GRCh37 with BWA and PCR duplications were marked using Picard tools (version 1.57). To further increase the specificity for mutation calling, realignment and base recalibration were conducted using Genome Analysis tool kit (GATK). All samples were tested at least in an average depth of 200-fold coverage. Bases with a minimum of 30-fold coverage was required at every targeted position (Additional file : Table S2). The missense, nonsense, indel and splice site mutations that located at the upstream or downstream 1-2 bp of exon, whose frequency are below 5% in at least one pubic population database were retained (Additional file : Table S3). According to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants, all the gene variants were classified into 5 grades. Therefore, 14 mutations at least carried by two first-degree relatives were listed. A pathogenic variant (class 5) in MLH1 (c.1852_1854delAAG, p.K618del) was identified in all patient\u2019s blood samples (Table ).\nLaparoscopy-assisted colectomy was performed on the proband to resect right colonic mass and its surrounding tissue followed by ileocolonic anastomosis. In addition, the clinicopathologic stage was pT3N0M0 and no complications occurred in the perioperative period. Conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry were performed on resected specimens to confirm the malignancy (Fig. and ). Additionally, abdominal CT of III5 showed a obstructing mass in the same location of colon as the proband (III7) (Fig. and ). Moreover, according to the medical record for the proband\u2019s brother (III6) in another hospital, a tumor was found in his hepatic flexure of colon. Immunohistochemistry results showed MMR deficiency in all tumor tissues of the 3 cancer patients (Table ). Subsequently, MSI testing was performed using MSI Analysis System Version 1.2 (Promega). Tumor DNA was extract from formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections. Genomic DNA extracted from white blood cell was used as normal control. Seven markers were amplified using fluorescent PCR. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis using Applied Biosystem 3130 Genetic Analyzer. GeneMapper Analysis Software was used to analyze the output data. The MSI results indicated that the 3 siblings with cancer (III5, 6 and 7) were all microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) (Table ). Based on the results of MSI and the proband\u2019s clinical stage, no adjuvant chemotherapy was given after surgery.\nTo screen and evaluate the cancer developing risk in the offspring, children of affected individuals were also enrolled for genetic testing. And 1 (IV8) out of 3 carries the same MLH1 mutation to the proband. However, this carrier has no symptoms or confirmed diagnosis of cancer. Endoscopy was performed on IV8 for further examination and the ileocecal mucosa showed signs of dysplasia, including chronic inflammation with erosion, lymphoid hyperplasia and mild atypical hyperplasia of glandular epithelium (Fig. ). The asymptomatic individual was given oral administration of aspirin as a preventative treatment, and 6-months follow-up showed improved appearance with colonoscopy examination (Fig. ). A healthcare plan was proposed to this offspring including colonoscopy and urine test once a year, and gastroscopy every 3~ 5 years after 35 years old. All individuals carrying the MLH1 mutation in this family will be monitored on a long term basis.\nThe CARE guidelines were followed in reporting this case.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Tumor marker, thyroid-function, chest X-ray, and electrocardiographic assessments yielded normal results. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed inflammatory areas in both lungs and bilateral pleural effusion. Urinary tract color ultrasonography showed that the left kidney measured 9.0 cm \u00d7 5.1 cm and had 1.2-cm-thick parenchyma; the right kidney measured 8.8 cm \u00d7 5.0 cm, and had 1.3-cm-thick parenchyma. No abnormalities were observed in the ureters or bladder. Owing to the risk of cardiac arrest because of hyperkalemia, hemodialysis was performed. The right femoral vein was catheterized under local anesthesia, and 5000 IU low-molecular weight heparin was administered for anticoagulation.\nFour hours after LMWH was administered, the patient felt increasing pain in the lower abdominal region after straining at stool and an urgent desire to micturate. A physical examination revealed a tender mass in the lower abdomen. Urgent bedside urinary tract ultrasonography showed large amount of fluid in the bladder. A 20-Fr in-dwelling catheter was inserted, but there was no obvious outflow of urine through the catheter, and the abdominal pain was not improved. Therefore, abdominal and pelvic CT was performed, which revealed marked hematoma that extended to the prevesical space and bilateral rectus sheath hematomas (RSHs; type III). The following emergency measures were undertaken immediately: bed rest, ice bag application, and compression bandaging. In addition, a blood coagulation profile was obtained, which showed the following: prothrombin time, 12.80 s (10\u201314 s); activated partial thromboplastin time, 47.40 s (23\u201335 s); and fibrinogen, 3.04 g/L (2\u20134 g/L).

{"clinical_note": "Patient 1 is a 74-year-old male who underwent HoLEP for refractory bladder outlet obstruction and bladder stones. His medical history included BPH complicated by recurrent urinary tract infections and bladder stones, elevated prostate specific antigen (biopsy negative), hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Preoperative transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) estimated prostate volume to be 150 cc. HoLEP was performed utilizing a two-incision technique. Owing to the large amount of adenoma, extended time was spent during morcellation (120 minutes) because of poor observation secondary to bladder neck bleeding. There was noted to be an area of capsular perforation at the 5 o'clock position in the mid gland. When the operative drapes were removed, significant abdominal distention was noted.\nIn discussion with anesthetist, the patient's airway pressures upon induction ranged from 10 to 20, however, at this point in the procedure, the airway pressures had increased >30. The patient was also experiencing systolic pressures ranging from 80 to 90, whereas preoperatively he was >110 systolic. The drapes were removed at this time and the abdomen appeared distended and was firm on examination. Given the significant abdominal distention and concern for a bladder injury secondary to poor observation during morcellation, general surgery was consulted intraoperatively. Per the recommendation of general surgery, they elected to proceed with a subumbilical minilaparotomy, after initial laparoscopy was unsuccessful because of increased opening pressures with the Veress needle. Less than 400 cc of bloody-colored fluid was suctioned out of the abdomen, and an intraoperative cystogram was performed that revealed retroperitoneal extravasation without intraperitoneal bladder injury or perforation. As there was not a significant amount of intraperitoneal fluid, it was theorized that the capsular perforation resulted in extraperitonealization of intraoperative saline. Thus, a 10F Jackson Pratt drain was placed in the pelvis, and the fascia and skin were closed. He was given 20 mg of IV Lasix intraoperatively.\nThe patient was extubated effectively and transferred postoperatively to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring and observation. In the ICU, cardiology was consulted because of a prolonged PR interval and bradycardia that ultimately warranted no further work-up. On postoperative day (POD) 1, the patient was progressing well, and he was transferred to the floor in stable condition. The Jackson-Pratt drain output was 710 cc on POD 0, 81 cc on POD 1, and then removed on POD 2 after draining 20 cc. The patient was discharged on POD 3. His catheter was removed on POD 10.

In addition, there was no suspicion for a significant mismatch between irrigation used and fluid output collected in the drainage system.\nGiven the previous similar presentation in Case 1 with no suspicion of bladder injury, we suspected that the patient had extraperitoneal extravasation of the saline irrigation through a capsular perforation as occurred in Case 1. The decision was made for the patient to be awakened, extubated, and transferred to the recovery room where he was further monitored. A stat noncontrast abdominal CT scan was performed that revealed a moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis and upper abdomen; the fluid in the pelvis and lower abdomen was distributed in the extraperitoneal region with no evidence of hematoma (). The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the floor with continuous bladder irrigation. The patient was given a 40 mg dose of Lasix \u223c8 hours after the operation was completed. Overnight, there were no acute events. On POD 1, the patient's abdomen was soft and significantly less distended. The Foley catheter drained 3950 cc of urine overnight without evidence of hematuria. The patient was discharged with a catheter on POD 1. The patient had his catheter removed on POD 9. A postoperative CT cystogram revealed no evidence of leak with resolution of the pelvic and perivesical fluid (). Thirty grams of benign prostate tissue was removed on final pathology analysis. The patient was noted to have a bladder neck contracture seen on cystoscopy 4 months after his procedure for which he underwent cystourethroscopy and laser incision of bladder neck contracture.", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

After the procedure, the catheter could not be removed. Therefore, the pediatric unit consulted us regarding the problem. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a guidewire was inserted through the feeding tube to uncoil it, but this failed (). Therefore, we planned to cut the knot endoscopically under general anesthesia. The patient was taken to the operating room and put under general anesthesia. Considering the relaxation effect of the anesthesia before cystoscopy and the danger of urethral trauma, it was then planned to remove the catheter by gently pulling it out. Since there was no resistance encountered and no serious tension on the catheter was observed, the operation proceeded as planned. The catheter seemed to be removed with ease. There are cases in the literature that report of removing knotted catheters using the said method. After the catheter was removed fully with the knot at the tip (), cystoscopy was performed to check for any potential urethral injury.

{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 65-year-old woman who presented with a 1-month history of bloody stool. A digital colonoscopy with biopsies revealed adenocarcinoma in the sigmoid colon. The patient elected to undergo primary laparoscopic colon resection, and the procedure was reported to be uneventful. However, on the 6th postoperative day, the patient noticed a large amount of yellow fluid coming out of a left side abdominal drain. The fluid appeared to be urine. An abdominal ultrasonography showed a collection of fluid in the patient's pelvis. A contrasted computed tomography (CT) scan showed contrast extravasation in the pelvis and around the descending colon (). The patient had decreased serum protein and albumin; however, complete blood count, creatinine, liver functions, and urine analysis were normal. On the 8th postoperative day, the patient was taken to the operating room for a ureteroscopy. The ureteroscopy revealed that the left ureter was completely severed about 4 to 5 cm from the ureteral orifice (, transected distal end of the ureter). The bowels could be seen through the ureteroscope (, intraabdominal cavity with bowels seen through the distal end of the transected ureter). No other obvious injury was identified. With patience, persistence, and some difficulty, the severed upper end of the ureter was identified and entered (, the proximal end of the transected ureter). We estimated that there was a 3- to 4-cm gap between the two ends of the ureter. Two 0.035\u2033 guidewires were first passed, followed by the placement of two 4.5F Double-J ureteral stents. After placing the Double-J stents, the abdominal drainage quickly subsided. An abdominal ultrasonography 6 days after tube placement showed complete resolution of the abdominal fluid collection. The abdominal drain was removed and the patient was discharged. At the 3-month follow-up, a repeat CT scan showed no hydronephrosis, no abdominal fluid collection, and no contrast extravasation. The patient, however, had an asymptomatic urinary tract infection from Klebsiella pneumoniae, which was treated and resolved. A follow-up ureteroscopy over a guidewire showed excellent healing and realignment of the disrupted ureter. The only obvious sign of the transacted ureter was that the mucosa was paler than normal. Because of this unconventional treatment, we decided to continue stenting the ureter with two fresh 4.5F Double-J stents for an additional 4 weeks. Stents were removed 4 months after the injury. Follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scans taken 8 and 14 months after the initial endoscopic treatment showed mild but unchanged residual dilation of the renal pelvis and ureter with good drainage.

She was born through normal vaginal delivery at term from an uneventful pregnancy. Her past medical and family histories were unremarkable. On our initial physical examination, she had normal anthropometric characteristics for age, as well as normal vital parameters. Examination of her skin revealed a large, irregular, well-demarcated and unequally pigmented (bluish-brown to black) multinodular hypertrophic nevus occupying almost all her back (Fig. ). The largest diameter of this lesion was 45 cm. Its surface was rough and had several excoriation marks. No other malformation was apparent. An examination of her lungs, heart, abdomen, and extremities was otherwise normal. Despite the unavailability of histopathology in our setting, the aforementioned clinical findings were highly suggestive of a GCMN. She was scheduled for a free of charge surgical campaign due within the same year in her community. This surgical excision would provide several benefits namely the reduction of the risk of melanoma, improvement in aesthetics, and obtaining histopathology samples. Taking into consideration the psychosocial aspect of this pathology, our patient and her parents were also oriented to the consult of a psychologist. Meanwhile, her parents were counseled on signs of complications which should warrant urgent admission. At 3-month follow-up, she was still pending surgical intervention.

Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a 10-cm multi-lobular cystic pelvic mass containing the mixed heterogeneous solid component, fluid and papillary growth in the inner surface of cystic wall Significant venous flow was detected in the solid part and papillary growth lesion. Serum AFP (< 20 ng/ml), cancer antigen (CA)-125 (< 35 U/ml), and carcinoembryonic antigen (< 5 ng/ml), and CA19\u20139 (< 37 U/ml) were 60,721, 38.1, 84, and 97 ng/ml, respectively. All of these tumor markers from serum have their own specific cut off values and sensitivities, and they come from the same assay methods and from the same laboratory. All are elevated. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 9-cm heterogenous mass probably developed from the left adnexa (Fig. ) and a 4-cm well-defined mass located at the right subphrenic region (Fig. ), suggesting the diagnosis of left ovarian carcinoma with peritoneal seeding.\nThe patient underwent optimal debulking surgery, including total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy, and para-aortic lymphadenectomy (Fig. ). All gross tumors were almost completely resected. Histologically, sections of the left ovarian tumor showed a clear cell carcinoma (Fig. ). The tumor is composed of polygonal, cuboidal to columnar cells with clear cytoplasm arranged in solid nests and tubule-cystic growth patterns. Numerous hyaline globules are present. Some tumor cells also showed high-grade anaplastic nuclear features. Right ovarian tumor showed metastatic clear cell carcinoma (Fig. ). Typical yolk sac tumor differentiation and Shiller-Duval body were absent. Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4) was strongly positive (Fig. ). Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for glypican-3 (GPC3) and AFP and negative for CD30. Meanwhile, the tumor cells showed weak positive staining for hepatocyte nuclear factor1-beta (HNF-1beta) (Fig. ). The tumor cells were focally positive for cytokeratin (CK) 20 and Cdx2 (caudal type homeobox 2) and negative for CK7 (Fig. ). To rule out potential artifacts due to antibody issues, we titrated the antibody used for AFP staining (Fig. ). For every immunohistochemical stain, positive controls were included. As a negative control, we also stained the classical clear cell carcinoma (Fig. ). Combination of all made a diagnosis of AFP-producing clear cell type EOC with fetal gut differentiation, FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) IIIc.\nAfter surgery, the patient received adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel). After treatment, CT showed a 2-cm hypodense nodule at the right subphrenic region and wedge-shaped hypoperfusion over segment 7 of the liver, suspicious tumor seeding, and liver metastasis (Fig. ) and serum level of AFP was 1831 ng/ml. Tumor excision for liver metastasis was done. Dose-intensity chemotherapy with weekly paclitaxel was given. CT scan, 1 year later, showed a lobulated mixed solid and cystic lesion at the right paracolic gutter measuring 5 cm in size in favor of peritoneal seeding (Fig. ). Exploratory laparotomy was done, including the use of Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator. After operation, chemotherapy was given through intraperitoneal route.

{"clinical_note": "A fit and active 38-year-old female presented to the Accident and Emergency Department with a four-day history of worsening right shoulder pain radiating down the right arm, with swelling around the shoulder. This was accompanied by intermittent fevers for the preceding two days. The patient graded the pain to be 8/10 on a visual analogue scale for pain. The patient reported an episode of right shoulder pain three weeks prior to current presentation which developed while she was boxing with a punch bag and resolved spontaneously in 2-3 days without seeking any medical advice.\nThe patient denied any history of infections in the previous 6 weeks. She had a significant past medical history of cellulitis around the leg 6 months prior and a Bartholin cyst that was treated conservatively 8 months before this presentation. She was not on any routine medications and did not have any predisposing medical conditions such as immunosuppression or diabetes.\nAt presentation, all her observations were essentially unremarkable except temperature which was recorded to be 38.6\u00b0C. On examination, the right shoulder was tender and swollen with severely restricted active and passive range of movements. No cellulitis, erythema, or differential warmth was noted.\nHaematological investigations showed mild leukocytosis with a white cell count of 11.1 \u00d7 109/L with predominant neutrophilia and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 233 mg/L. Liver functions tests, urea and electrolytes, bone profile, and coagulation studies were all within normal limits. Plain radiographs of the chest and shoulder were essentially unremarkable. Shoulder aspirate analysis was negative for any organisms, however showed some scanty pus cells. The patient was started on IV flucloxacillin 1 g intravenous four times a day as she was continuing to have temperature spikes, although shoulder aspirate cultures and blood cultures were negative.\nDue to the patient's severe symptoms and markedly elevated CRP level, urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right shoulder was performed. This revealed marked oedema throughout the subscapularis muscle with a relatively well-defined ovoid area of hyperintensity on short-tau-inversion-recovery (STIR) () and isointensity to muscle on T1 (). The area measured 9 cm on the oblique axial diameter, almost 3 cm in depth, and over 3.5 cm craniocaudally, with fluid extending inferiorly from the subscapular region overlying the chest wall axially measuring over 5 cm transversely and 1.5 cm in depth on T2-weighted images (). This MRI confirmed abscess formation within the subscapularis muscle as the cause of the presentation.\nThe patient underwent surgical open drainage of the right subscapularis abscess under general anaesthesia via a standard deltopectoral approach. During mobilisation of the conjoined tendon, approximately 150 mL of blood-stained pus exuded from the subscapularis muscle. The subscapularis muscle was left with a defect but subscapularis tendon integrity was maintained. Following irrigation, the wound was closed. Cultures of the evacuated pus grew PVL-positive S. aureus, sensitive to flucloxacillin. No per operative signs of intraarticular infection were found, and an on table aspirate yielded no organisms on gram stain and cultures. The case was discussed with musculoskeletal microbiologist, and the patient was given a further two-week course of flucloxacillin.\nAt the 6-week follow-up to assess improvement, the patient's wound had healed well and shoulder pain had resolved with no signs of recurrence of the infection.

{"clinical_note": "A 50-year-old female (BMI = 35) presented to our clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, with a chief complaint of right shoulder pain. She has a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Her medications included hydroxyzine for anxiety, ibuprofen for joint pains, lisinopril for hypertension, and pioglitazone tablets and liraglutide (Victoza\u00ae; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) subcutaneous injections for diabetes. She had a several-year history of intermittent low-grade right shoulder pain that was attributed to subacromial bursitis. This had been treated with subacromial corticosteroid injections and physical therapy, which only gave moderate pain relief.\nHer right shoulder pain worsened acutely in April 2016 after her dog jerked on the leash, almost causing her to fall. Radiographs obtained one month later demonstrated a hooked acromion and subtle decrease in trabecular bone density adjacent to the greater tuberosity, but no distinct bone lesions were noted (). The subtle decrease in trabecular bone was considered to possibly reflect disuse osteopenia associated with a long-standing rotator cuff tear [\u2013]. Subsequent MRI with intra-articular contrast was obtained which demonstrated what was interpreted as a small full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon. The MR images also revealed multiple quasi-circular lesions within the proximal humerus that were suggestive of metastases or multiple myeloma (). Bone lesions were also in close proximity to the insertion of the supraspinatus tendon.\nTen days prior to the radiographs, she had an unrelated skin biopsy of a facial lesion that was diagnosed as sarcoidosis. A biopsy of the humeral lesions seen on MRI revealed noncaseating granulomatous inflammation, confirming osseous sarcoid of the humerus (). Additionally, mediastinal and hilar adenopathy seen on a subsequent chest computed tomography (CT) were consistent with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.\nWith osseous sarcoid lesions, there is concern that pathologic disturbances in bone architecture could make surgical repair involving cortical bone difficult []. For example, Ungprasert et al. [] reported an increased incidence of fragility fracture in the proximal humerus in patients with sarcoidosis of the humerus. However, given that our patient's humeral lesions involved cancellous bone, while cortical bone was spared, we concluded that the lesions were not a contraindication to a standard surgical repair of the rotator cuff tear. This is because only a small amount of cortical bone needs to be removed during the repair of a small rotator cuff tear [, ]. However, larger tears and/or cases with more invasive sarcoid lesions might require advanced repair techniques [, ]. This was not a concern in our patient's case because during surgery only a low-grade partial tear was found. Surgical treatment was done by JGS and included arthroscopic debridement, bursectomy, and acromioplasty [, ]. The shavings from the surgical procedure were not obtained for histological analysis. However, the tissues did not appear to be grossly abnormal.\nDespite being enrolled in a physical therapy program at two weeks after surgery, she had an unusually prolonged recovery because of flares of pain in addition to shoulder stiffness. Treatment for this included a one-time seven-day course of an oral corticosteroid on a tapered dose schedule (methylprednisolone tablets; Medrol\u00ae dose pack; Pfizer Inc., New York, USA). Because the improvement with this was less than satisfactory, two sets of subacromial and glenohumeral corticosteroid injections (Depo-Medrol injectable suspension; Pfizer Inc., New York, USA) were administered two months apart []. Supervised physical therapy was also continued.\nBecause of continuing shoulder and generalized pain flares coupled with a great sense of fatigue, the patient consulted with a rheumatologist who prescribed adalimumab (Humira\u00ae, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA) subcutaneous injections once every other week. Adalimumab is a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitor that was selected over other first-line therapies for sarcoidosis because of its greater effect on sarcoidosis-associated fatigue []. Our patient reported that the adalimumab injections greatly improved her fatigue and thereby enhanced her ability to participate in physical therapy. At final postoperative follow-up at 48 months after her shoulder surgery the patient reported that she had an excellent result that included complete pain relief and restoration of full range of motion and strength.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'recognizes associated conditions of a disease', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

He was apparently working from the above height when he slipped and fell on a sharp piece of iron rod which penetrated deep into the right anterior neck. He quickly pulled the sharp iron rod out when he got up from the floor. According to him, the bleeding was not profuse and stopped when he arrived at the local hospital to search for remedy (). He did not have hemiplegia, paraplegia, or quadriplegia when we saw him. He is not known to be hypertensive. He did not take alcohol prior to the fall although he takes alcohol occasionally. He had a left femoral fracture at the age of 24 and a right femoral fracture at the age of 32; both incidences were operated on successfully. On examination at our facility we saw a middle aged man who was conscious and alert but however acutely ill with his neck fixed in cervical collar. General as well as systemic examination did not yield much. All the systems where grossly normal. Neurological examination revealed normal pupils which reacted normally to light. Cranial nerves examination was unremarkable. Power on four limbs as well as reflexes was normal. Digital rectal examination revealed a normal spinster tone. Routine laboratory as well as other ancillary (ECG, CXR, etc.) investigations were normal.\nNeck CT-scan done at the local hospital revealed C2-C4 transverse process fractures on the right side, fracture at the right lamina of C3, and right common carotid artery dissection. CT-scan of the head showed no abnormalities (Figures and ). Explorative three-dimensional reconstruction plain and enhanced scan imaging of the cervical spine, chest, and abdomen done at our facility revealed two segmental stenoses of the right common carotid artery with very pale V1 and V3 segment of the right vertebral artery as well as blockage at V2 segment (Figures \u2013) as well as fracture at the right lamina of C3 and C2-C4 transverse processes with free bone fragments and peripheral soft tissue swelling (Figures \u2013). The skin at the right anterior cervical region is discontinuous, with adjacent soft tissue swellings and gas accumulation. The bilateral carotid artery sheath lymph nodes slightly enlarged. At the upper lobe of the right lung there were multiple calcifications, some of which were adjacent to the pleura. There was also slight thickening of the left pleura. The heart was not enlarged but we observed slight accumulation of gas in the anterior mediastinum. Multiple low-density lesions were seen in the liver which we think are constant cysts.

Intraoperative cerebral angiography showed right carotid artery dissection and right vertebral artery occlusion. There was some reparation at the distal end of the right vertebral artery. The left vertebral artery was however normal. We introduced the guiding catheter guide wire to the proximal end of the right common carotid artery with continued infusion of heparinized saline, after which we introduced a guide wire with a Cordis stent (10 \u2217 60mm) to completely cover the right common carotid artery dissection site with stenosis and released the stent gradually until it completely filled the stenosis area (Figures \u2013)). We delivered contrast agent into right common carotid artery to make sure it was patent before removing the guiding catheter followed by withdrawal of the femoral arterial sheath. Control contrasted angiograph done revealed stenting was successful (Figures and ). The patient recovered markedly and was discharged home a week after.

Though occasionally he suffered from jaw lock, other symptoms associated with neurologic deficit such as drooling, facial weakness, paresthesia, or auditory defects were absent. Apart from being a social alcohol consumer, there was no history of smoking, prior radiation, or significant family medical history, especially in regard to his present illness.\nPhysical examination revealed a tender right parotid swelling below the ear lobule, which extended inferiorly to the angle of the mandible (). The skin overlying the swelling was slightly erythematous, thickened, and nodular. The swelling was firm, diffused, and fixed to the underlying muscles, and there was no associated lymphadenopathy. Otoscopic examination of both ears was within normal limits.\nThe patient initially had a neck ultrasound and then a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize the nature of the lesion. The neck CT scan revealed a well-defined altered signal enhancing mass measuring 3.5 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 2.0 cm at the posterior aspect of the superficial part of the right parotid gland (). The radiologist's impression was an altered signal enhancing mass lesion, likely to be a benign pleomorphic adenoma. The patient then underwent MRI of the parotid glands, which showed a well-defined focal lesion of altered signal intensity at the posterior aspect of the superficial part of the right parotid gland, measuring 3.5 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 2.0 cm along its maximum transverse, craniocaudal, and anteroposterior diameters, respectively. The impression was again benign pleomorphic adenoma of the right parotid gland. However, the radiologist could not exclude other diagnostic possibilities and recommend fine-needle aspiration cytology.\nFine-needle aspiration cytology of the mass was nonconclusive as the smears only showed polymorphous population of lymphoid cells in keeping with intraparotid lymph node. In view of these clinical findings, a superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve monitoring and preservation was planned.\nA modified Blair incision was done, with elevation of a skin flap and control of hemostasis during the surgery. The dissection was rather difficult! The superficial parotidectomy was done in piecemeal as the mass was unexpectedly adherent to the skin and underlying fascia (). The facial nerve was intact and was examined branch by branch. No frozen section was done during the operation.\nHistopathologic examination showed a widely infiltrative tumor involving the parotid parenchyma and extending into the surrounding adipose tissue and skeletal muscles (). The tumor was predominantly composed of bland spindle cells with wavy nuclear contours, embedded within a fibrillary, pale pink matrix, which resembled a neurofibroma (). Of concern, there were evidently distinct scattered more cellular foci of epithelioid tumor cells with nuclear atypia and increased mitotic activity (). The tumor was diffusely and intensely positive for the S100 protein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) immunohistochemical stains, with a low Ki-67 proliferation index. In addition, the CD34 immunohistochemical stain was focally positive in tumor cells. On the other hand, the tumor lacked immunoreactivity for AE1/AE3, p63, EMA, Melan-A, and HMB-45 immunohistochemical stains, thus excluding carcinomas, clear-cell sarcoma, melanoma, and other salivary gland tumors. Based on morphologic and immunophenotypic features of the tumor, the diagnosis rendered was low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) arising in a diffuse neurofibroma.\nGiven the rare presentation and the association of such tumors with NF1, the patient was evaluated clinically for features of the syndrome. Multiple caf\u00e9 au lait macules were subsequently discovered on his trunk ().

On flexible fibreoptic evaluation, there was a 0.5 cm polypoidal, cystic mass pedicled on the medial free edge of the middle 1/3 of the right true vocal fold. There was no abnormality of vocal fold mobility. Rest of the ENT examination was normal.\nBased on a history of long-standing hoarseness, voice abuse, and presence of a solitary polypoidal lesion over the true vocal fold, a preoperative diagnosis of a laryngeal polyp was made.

He was started on prednisone 40 mg daily and pyridostigmine 120 mg four times daily, two and a half months prior to admission, and azathioprine 150 mg daily, 10 days prior to admission. Upon presentation, he was found to have a temperature of 102.7 degrees Fahrenheit, with a heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure of 159/87 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.\nA complete blood count with differential was remarkable for a white blood cell count of 15,000 cells/mm3, with 89% neutrophils and venous lactate of 2.6 mmol/L. All other laboratory parameters including electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, blood glucose, and liver function tests were within normal limits. Given the fever, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate, the initial concern was for sepsis. Infectious workup included blood cultures, chest X-ray, urinalysis with urine culture, respiratory viral panel, Lyme titers, and procalcitonin. The chest X-ray showed a possible new left lower lobe basilar opacity, procalcitonin was 0.59 ng/mL, and the patient was started on antibiotics with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for suspected lower respiratory tract infection. Of note, his azathioprine was discontinued on presentation, due to concern for continued immunosuppression and possible infection. Two days after presentation, given the improvement in clinical symptoms the azathioprine 150 mg was reinitiated. Within a few hours, he became acutely ill, febrile to 103.7 degrees Fahrenheit and tachycardic to 115 beats per minute, with return of the initial presenting symptoms and new onset photophobia. Initially, there was concern for worsening sepsis; repeat procalcitonin was ordered along with C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), with antimicrobial therapy broadened to vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and intravenous acyclovir. Notably, a diffuse 1 cm papulopustular rash erupted over the scalp, head, neck, thorax, abdomen, and upper and lower extremities including the palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand (). As the cutaneous findings were nonspecific, the differential remained broad and infectious workup included bacterial, fungal, viral, or drug hypersensitivity. Drug hypersensitivity was suspected given the return of symptoms along with rash after rechallenge of azathioprine and the temporal response to the symptoms. The repeat procalcitonin was now elevated further to 5.36 ng/mL along with an elevated C-reactive protein of >270 mg/L and an ESR of 44 mm/hr.\nThe azathioprine was discontinued and the symptoms subsided with the pustules reduced in size and number. Biopsy of the pustule showed suppurative folliculitis, which is expected from a neutrophil driven process, consistent with azathioprine hypersensitivity (). All pustule stains, bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster and varicella zoster, and periodic acid-Schiff-diastase (PAS-D) stains, were negative. Repeat liver function tests including AST/ALT remained within normal limits, and a complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 9,300 cells/mm3 with 0% eosinophils. Antimicrobial therapy was deescalated. Over the next few days, the rash and symptoms resolved and the CRP decreased to 108 g/L. We utilized the Naranjo algorithm to estimate the probability of azathioprine causing hypersensitivity and found that our patient had a probable hypersensitivity reaction to azathioprine [].", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "An 80-year-old female presented to clinic with a mass over the superior aspect of the right scapula. The mass was achy but did not interfere with performing activities of daily living. However, it was bothersome for the patient and she stated that it had been enlarging over the previous few months. She denies any local injuries or recent surgeries on the affected side. She denied having weakness in the left arm when compared to the contralateral side. She denied having trouble with overhead activities. She had not noticed any constitutional symptoms or nighttime pain. She did give a history of having a similar mass on the contralateral side, which was excised 10 years previously with a favorable result. She was very interested in having the new mass excised as well.\nInspection of the area is unremarkable, but palpation of the area demonstrates a firm, nonmobile, and nonpulsatile mass in the area of the upper trapezius overlying the scapula. The mass is longer in its medial to lateral dimension than craniocaudad. With deeper palpation, slight tenderness can be elicited. Examination of the shoulder does not yield signs of rotator cuff weakness or shoulder pain with provocative maneuvers.\nPlain X-ray demonstrates narrowing of the posterior glenohumeral joint space with sclerosis secondary to osteoarthritic changes. The acromiohumeral interval is measured to be 8 mm without signs of superior migration of the humeral head.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows an elongated lesion arising from the AC joint and tracking medially to superficial and within the trapezius muscle (Figures and ). It measures 2 cm (AP) \u00d7 13 cm (transverse) \u00d7 1.8 cm (craniocaudad). The lesion appears cystic with peripheral enhancement. There is also suspected full-thickness tear of the anterior fibers of the supraspinatus.\nAlthough the mass did not prevent the patient from performing her activities of daily living, it was bothersome enough for her that she wanted it removed. Under a general anesthetic, an incision was made directly over the palpable mass. With careful dissection, a stalk emanating from the AC joint was identified. The mass extended laterally from the AC joint within the trapezius muscle for approximately 13 cm (). Once it was dissected free, the mass was removed en bloc. A distal clavicle excision was then performed using an oscillating saw. After the cyst was excised, it was incised revealing thick mucoid content (Figures and ).\nThe patient was followed up at three weeks and three months postoperatively. She said she felt pain relief immediately after the surgery and she continued to have full, pain-free range of motion with no signs of recurrence.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 74-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital in March 2017 to undergo liver resection to treat a malignant hepatic lesion diagnosed with CT and PET and a fine-needle biopsy positive for squamous carcinoma. The hepatic tumour discovered during follow-up for a previous bladder cancer submitted to endoscopic surgery three years before measured 22 mm in diameter and was located in the VIII Couinaud's segment [] of the liver in association with three smaller hypodense liver lesions with a focal dilatation of peripheral biliary tree ().\nThe case is discussed with radiologists, oncologists, and pathologists of our hospital. Even if the lesion had been the single site of disease; due to the proximity/doubtful infiltration of the lesion to the biliary tree, we decided to submit the patient to an explorative staging laparotomy and possible palliative surgery.\nOur internal protocol states that during the preadmission every patient who is a candidate for a liver resection is subjected to a routine liver function test with ICG to determinate the most appropriate surgical procedures []: 0,5 mg/Kg ICG are routinely injected intravenously up to seven days before surgery to evaluate the ICG retention rate at 15 min (R15). In our case 45 mg of ICG was intravenously administrated to test hepatic function, ten days before the surgery (patient R15 = 8.9).\nThanks to the ICG property of being fluorescent with the light emitted from the photodynamic eye of the laparoscopic system in our possession, it is possible to visualize the lesion during the surgical procedure. To this target, timing of administration and dose of ICG are key points.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that the effective dose of ICG depends on the timing of injection; in particular, if the function liver test had been performed more than 7 days before surgery it would have been necessary to administer an adjunctive dose (0,1 mg/Kg) the day before []. In this case, it was necessary to administrate an adjunctive dose of ICG the day before the surgery (9 mg of ICG injected intravenously). After laparotomy, exploration of the abdominal cavity, and exposure of the liver, we easily confirmed the superficial lesion in the VIII Couinaud's segment. The liver surface has been analysed with the fluorescent imaging system. The fluorescing tumour has been clearly identified and defined on the liver surface, as shown in . We have also identified that a large area of fluorescent parenchyma that gets from the peripheral of the lesion up to the portal pedicle such as the neoplasia would interest the right biliary tree in the form of neoplastic lymphangitis (). This datum was not preoperatively known.\nA right hepatectomy would have been the oncologically correct surgical procedure due to the infiltration of right biliary duct. Considering the probable metastatic nature of the lesion, the absence of a clearly primary lesion, the age, the comorbidities, and the small size of residual liver, we have decided to perform an atypical segmental resection of S8 associated with cholecystectomy and lymphadenectomy of the hepatic pedicle nodes, including the area of impaired biliary excretion.\nAt the histological examination, the lesion, the lymph nodes of the hepatic pedicle region, and the right biliary branch, respectively, resulted in hepatic metastases from squamous cell carcinoma and sites of metastatic location. As expected the resection margin was interested by neoplasia.\nIn particular, the histological examination showed the following:Macroscopical exam: the neoplasia, in a site, appears to be in contact with the resection margin Microscopical exam: parenchymal hepatic section that showed metastatic localization of squamous carcinoma moderately differentiated. The neoplasia interest the surgery resection margin.\nIn this case, fluorescent imaging has revealed a fluorescing ring around the hepatic metastasis (). The fluorescence of the cholestatic area was shown on the cut surface ().", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

She was nonsmoker and did not have any chronic disease. Her dyspnea and hypoxemia were getting worse and she was accepted to ICU. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (MV) was used for initial treatment but hypoxemia was worsened; hence, she was intubated and invasive MV was used. On her physical examination, we auscultated mild crackles bilateral on lower lung zones. Her chest X-ray showed bilateral nonhomogenous infiltration at middle and lower zones (). While initial fraction of inhaled oxygenation (FiO2) was 80% on MV, her PaO2 was 65 mmHg and lung protective MV strategies were applied. An appropriate fluid replacement, antibiotics, and other medical treatments were applied. Undergoing MV, FiO2 level was decreased gradually and she was weaned from MV on her fifth day of ICU stay and MV. After weaning, we observed that her oral secretions increased and her left nasolabial sulcus wiped out. On her neurological examination, abnormal findings were not found except left facial paralysis. We did not study out any pathological imagination neither on her cranial computed tomography (CT) nor on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) was diagnosed and intravenous steroid treatment 1 milligram per kilogram (methylprednisolone) was added to her therapy by neurologist. At the same time, dermatological lesion occurred and, on her dermatologic examination, oedema on her face, pustular lesions on her skin, and fissure on her tongue were detected; therefore labium mucosal biopsy was taken and mucositis was reported ().

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine also demonstrated an L2 vertebral fracture and disruptions of the posterior ligamentous complex between L1 and L2, in combination with extensive subcutaneous hematoma ().\nComputed tomography (CT) of the spine in the sagittal orientation and 3-dimensional (3D) CT further revealed the involvement of the superior end plate of the L2 vertebra, comprising horizontal splitting from the left pedicle, through the left transverse process, and reaching the center of the neural arch (). The right-sided L2 pedicle was intact.\nAfter checking the general condition of the patient and excluding intra-abdominal injury by enhanced CT and ultrasonography, the patient underwent L1-L2 single-level instrumented fusion using a posterior approach. Initially, monoaxial pedicle screws with conventional trajectory were placed at L1 and L2 pedicles on the right side (intact pedicle side). A rod slightly bent in lordosis was then introduced and connected with these pedicle screws with a compression force applied between screws. This procedure achieved reduction and the fracture gap at the left L2 pedicle and lamina was completely closed. Polyaxial pedicle screws were used on the left side. A pedicle screw with a conventional trajectory was placed at the left L1 pedicle. A CBT pedicle screw was then inserted through the fractured L2 pedicle under fluoroscopy. This CBT screw was used as an alternative to an osteosynthesis screw. A rod was introduced on the left side, bilateral facet fusion with local bones obtained from the lower one-third of the L1 spinous process was performed, and the wound was closed. Although the merits of cross connectors for CBT screws remain unclear, we applied the connector in this case because connecting bilateral pedicle screws along conventional trajectories has been reported to increase the pullout strength of these screws [].

Stool analysis, ova and parasite test, Clostridium difficile toxin assay, and stool culture were negative. Colonoscopy revealed left-sided colitis with marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, and friability erosions (Mayo score 2). Biopsies showed chronic active colitis consistent with UC. Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory, endoscopic, and pathologic findings, the patient was diagnosed with moderate left-sided UC and was started on oral and topical 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) without any response to treatment: bloody diarrhea (more than 5 bowel movement per day), severe abdominal pain, low grade fever, and additional weight loss in addition to severe anemia (hemoglobin = 7.3g/dl) and high CRP with negative stool tests. High dose steroids therapy was started with marked improvement. Steroid tapering caused recurrence of symptoms and anemia at 20mg prednisone per day. Relying on the findings above, the patient had left-sided UC and is steroid-dependent, so Infliximab 5mg/kg was initiated at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks without any improvement after 4 months of treatment with persistent bloody diarrhea and severe iron deficiency anemia. Repeated colonoscopy showed severe inflammatory mucosa with deep ulcerations and pseudopolyps formation at the splenic flexure and the distal part of the left colon, separated by healed mucosa. Biopsies from the pathologic area revealed severe chronic active colitis consistent with inflammatory bowel disease/UC without any evidence of cytomegalovirus inclusions.

He had no baseline urinary or bowel problems, but did have erectile dysfunction adequately managed with sildenafil taken as needed for sexual performance. His AUA urinary symptom score was 3 and SHIM score was 14 without use of PDE5 inhibitors. Using the web-based Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram, his risk of nodal involvement was estimated to be 7% []. He was in good overall health and his age-adjusted life expectancy was estimated to be 19.4 additional years using the Social Security Administration life tables. After discussion of all treatment options with the multidisciplinary team, he elected to pursue definitive treatment with prostate SBRT.\nDiagnostic multi-parametric prostate MRI and review by the multidisciplinary prostate imaging conference previously demonstrated a 1.7 cm T2-weighted hypointense lesion with corresponding restricted diffusion in the anterior apical transition zone left of midline that was considered high suspicion based on imaging parameters but associated well to the systematic biopsy cores positive for prostate cancer (Figure ). The whole prostate volume and the area of MRI cancer suspicion were segmented using post image processing software. Following the MRI, three gold fiducial markers were placed in the urology office via a TRUS-guided approach. The radiation therapy planning CT scan was scheduled two weeks after fiducial placement. No urinary catheter, rectal balloon, or rectal spacer was used.\nAfter the simulation CT scan was completed, axial T2-weighted and post contrast T1-weighted MRI were fused with the CT images using radiation therapy planning software. Target volumes of the prostate and the high-risk lesion were then generated on the CT based on MRI segmented regions of suspicion. The radiation oncologist and urologist met to review the image fusion and target volumes prior to proceeding with final treatment planning. In this case, the highest suspicion lesion was located in the left anterior apical prostate as visible on T2-weighted MRI. Hence the prostate surrounding the high-risk lesion was included in the high-risk target volume for planned SIB (Figure ). For transition zone and central gland lesions, limiting dose to the urethra presents the greatest challenge to radiation therapy planning. However, most prostate SBRT protocols recommend achieving normal tissue dose limits over complete coverage of the high-risk target volume. In this case, adequate coverage was possible while limiting urethral dose to an acceptable range.\nThe high-risk volume received 40 Gy SIB in five fractions while the entire prostate received 36.25 Gy.

He denied any erectile dysfunction and had a SHIM score of 25. MP-MRI was performed, and review by the multidisciplinary prostate imaging conference revealed patchy diffuse abnormal signal that is often seen in patients with prior biopsy history and/or inflammation. Despite this diffuse irregularity in signal in the right posterolateral peripheral zone, there was a focal area of well-defined hypointensity with corresponding diffusion restriction suspicious for harboring prostate cancer. There was notable central gland hyperplastic nodules with regional areas of low T2 signal intensity in the left anterior transition zone that was low suspicion for representing malignancy more likely representing benign prostatic hyperplasia nodularity. With these findings, he underwent MRI/TRUS fusion-targeted biopsy that demonstrated GS 4+3 adenocarcinoma in 80% of the specimen cores sampled from the MRI-targeted lesion in the posterior peripheral zone. After discussion of all treatment options with the multidisciplinary team, he elected to proceed with prostate SBRT.\nThe patient then had TRUS-guided fiducial markers placed followed by the radiation therapy planning CT scan two weeks after fiducial marker insertion. CT and MRI fusion was performed to allow for CT generation of the target volumes of the prostate gland and the high-risk intraprostatic lesion which was used for MRI-targeted biopsy proven to represent the intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The radiation oncologist and urologist met to review this image fusion between treatment simulation CT and MP-MRI as well as target volumes for SBRT and SIB. In this case, the highest suspicion lesion was located in the posterior peripheral zone, well visualized on T2-weighted MRI around which the SIB region was drawn. Dose limitations in the region of the rectum were considered posteriorly, and the ipsilateral neurovascular bundle exposures were considered but not considered dose limiting (Figure ).\nThe SIB volume in the posterior peripheral zone received 40 Gy in five fractions while the entire prostate gland was administered 36.25 Gy over the same time course. The patient was being managed with tamsulosin prior to starting radiation therapy due to his history of lower urinary tract symptoms.

{"clinical_note": "A 58-year-old Caucasian woman, with past medical history significant for a 2.4 cm GIST diagnosed with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (Figures , ) (performed for persistent epigastric pain despite therapy) six months earlier and s/p laparoscopic partial gastrectomy, presented to the emergency department (ED) with new-onset jaundice initially observed by her son four days prior to arrival. Also, she reported generalized weakness, fatigue, and itching for the past several days. The patient reported no previous history of alcohol consumption, intravenous drug use, acquiring tattoos or non-sterile piercings, receiving transfusions of blood or blood products, sexual promiscuity, residence in a developing country, occupational exposure to toxins (she worked as a school teacher), or prior liver diseases. She reported no family history of liver diseases. The earlier biopsy had shown GIST, histologic grade G2 (high grade; mitotic rate > 5/50 per high-power field (HPF)), with spindle cells and no necrosis (Figures , ). The margins were negative. The tumor cells were positive / immunoreactive for CD34, CD117, and DOG-1 (Figures , ). A recent follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan showed no recurrence.\nAt presentation, the patient appeared icteric with yellowish discoloration of the skin and sclera. She was afebrile (temperature 97.4) and hemodynamically stable (heart rate 72 beats per minute (BPM), blood pressure 110/85 mm Hg). On physical exam, the abdomen was soft and not distended, with no tenderness and normoactive bowel sounds. Murphy\u2019s sign was negative and there was no guarding nor rigidity.\nInitial laboratory testing showed significantly elevated transaminases with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1450 U/L (10-35 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 1632 U/L (10-55 U/L). Also, there were increased total bilirubin of 4.9 mg/dL (<1.2 mg/dL) and increased direct bilirubin of 2.7 mg/dL (<0.6 mg/dL). The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 162 U/L (40-150 U/L), the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was 95 U/L (5-50 U/L), and the international normalized ratio (INR) was elevated at 1.9 (0.8-1.2). The serum total protein, serum albumin, serum electrolytes, and complete blood count (CBC) were within normal limits. The patient\u2019s Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was calculated to be 28 upon arrival.\nFurther laboratory testing showed that the serum iron level, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), serum ferritin, ceruloplasmin level, and thyroid function tests (TFTs) were within normal limits. An acetaminophen level and an autoimmune workup, including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), and anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), were negative. And, viral serologies for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were negative. An abdominal ultrasound revealed mild hepatomegaly.\nUpon medication reconciliation, it was discovered that the patient was taking imatinib, prescribed by her hematologist-oncologist, for the past four months. The medication was discontinued on hospital admission due to the concern for hepatotoxicity. No other potentially hepatotoxic medications were noted. Prior liver function tests (LFTs), before initiation of imatinib, were all within normal limits. As the LFTs were not improving with conservative management, an interventional radiology (IR)-guided liver biopsy was performed for the purpose of diagnosis as well as to assess the extent of liver injury (Figures -).\nAfter seven days, the patient\u2019s transaminases began to decrease, ultimately falling to AST of 483 U/L and ALT of 544 U/L during the hospital admission. The transaminases, as well as the rest of the LFTs, continued to trend down and were within normal range two months later.", "topic_list": "['mechanisms, drugs', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}
{"clinical_note": "A six-year-old-African American female presented to our care in April 2010 for the evaluation of sleep attacks and apnea during sleep. According to her mother, the patient experienced cataplexy episodes with laughter. At that time, the patient underwent a nocturnal polysomnogram (NPSG) for further investigation. According to the results of the sleep study, patient slept 474.00 minutes out of 539.3 minutes in bed for a sleep efficiency of 87.9% (n=89%). Her sleep latency was decreased at 7.3 minutes and 68.1% of the total sleep time was spent in the supine position. In addition, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and latency were logged at 17% and 68.5 minutes (n=136-156), respectively. Furthermore, the NPSG illustrated that the patient experienced five central apneas, one mixed apnea, five hypopneas, and an apnea-hypopnea index of 1.4 events/hour consistent with mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by pediatric criteria [].\nThe patient underwent another NPSG with a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) in November 2010 for persistent symptoms. Results indicated that the patient slept for 395.50 minutes out of the 411.8 minutes in bed, which translated to a sleep efficiency of 96.0%. Similar to the previous study, the patient experienced decreased sleep latency at 3.3 minutes. In addition, REM sleep and latency were logged at 20.4% and 106.5 minutes, respectively. In contrast to the earlier NPSG study, this evaluation illustrated three central apneas, six mixed apneas, nine obstructive hypopneas, and an apnea-hypopnea index of 2.9 events/hour with <1 being normal.\nAn MSLT is the primary diagnostic tool for narcolepsy and is typically performed following an NPSG to measure sleep latency, which is the time it takes an individual to go from wakefulness to sleep. Additionally, it measures how quickly the patient enters REM sleep, known as sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs). This test includes four or five nap periods of 20 minutes each []. The patient is instructed to lie in the darkroom and attempt to fall asleep. Sensors transmit data such as the amount of time needed to fall asleep and enter REM sleep. Once asleep, the patient will be woken up fifteen minutes later; if 20 minutes pass and the patient has not fallen asleep, the nap trial is terminated. Next, the patient is given a two-hour break before the second nap trial can begin. During this break, the patient must stay awake and this process is repeated four more times []. The results of the study include the mean sleep latency (MSL) and the number of SOREMPs recorded. The diagnostic criterion requires an MSL of \u22648 minutes and \u22652 SOREMPs on an MSLT []. Our patient underwent a series of five nap trials with a sleep latency of 3, 2, 3, 6, and 2 minutes, respectively, and a mean sleep latency of 3.2 minutes. However, the patient did not enter REM sleep during any nap trials, thus having 0 SOREMPS.

{"clinical_note": "A nine-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and distention for the past one week, with sudden increase in intensity of pain for the last four hours. The patient had not yet reached the age of menarche. There was no associated nausea or vomiting and her bowel habits were not affected. Past medical, surgical, and family history was also insignificant. An abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the lower abdomen with a firm palpable mass occupying the right side of the abdomen. Her blood counts showed an elevated total leukocyte count of 13,000 cells/dL with neutrophilic predominance. Initial clinical assessment raised the possibility of an appendicular mass.\nThe patient therefore immediately underwent a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which revealed a large soft tissue mass measuring approximately 80 x 150 x 170 mm in anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal dimensions, respectively, and was predominantly occupying the right mid and lower quadrant. The mass showed some areas of low attenuation, suggestive of necrosis/intratumoral edema (Figure ). There was free fluid noted adjacent to the lesion and in the pelvis (Figure ). The right ovary was separately identified and appeared normal (Figure ).\nAnteromedially, the mass had a tortuous, twisted vascular pedicle that was likely originating from the left adnexa (Figure ).\nAdditionally, few speckled calcifications were noted in the mass (Figure ). No enhancing fibrovascular septa were noted in the lesion.\nNo evidence of regional lymphadenopathy or distant metastases was found on the CT examination. On the basis of the radiological picture, an impression of left ovarian tumor with torsion was suggested.\nThe patient then underwent an exploratory laparotomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy along with partial omentectomy. Intraoperative findings included a large bilobed edematous mass weighing approximately 1.5 kg with a twisted, thickened vascular pedicle and varicosed vessels. The left fallopian tube was slightly thickened as well. No lymphadenopathy or invasion into the surrounding structures was seen.\nThe surgically resected specimen was then sent for histopathological analysis, which revealed a neoplastic lesion in the left ovary arranged in nests and trabeculae separated by fibrous septa. The cells were polygonal with moderate amount of clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei were round to oval, showed moderate plemorphism with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli and frequently visible mitotic activity. Scattered plasma cells and lymphocytes were present within the fibrous septa. In areas, tumor cells were seen scattered against edematous stroma. Thin-walled dilated and congested blood vessels were seen, suggestive of vascular compromise secondary to torsion. The neoplastic cells showed diffuse nuclear positive expression for octamer-binding transcription (OCT) 3/4 immunohistochemical stain. Intracytoplasmic glycogen was highlighted on Periodic acid-Schiff special stain (Figure ).\nThe overall findings confirmed mature ovarian dysgerminoma that was limited to the left ovary without capsular invasion (TNM stage: T1A, N0, M0 according to FIGO staging). The excised left fallopian tube, omentum, and peritoneal washout were all negative for malignancy.\nPostoperatively, the patient showed satisfactory progress and was therefore discharged in a stable condition.

{"clinical_note": "A 53-year-old white man presented to our Department with a 2-month history of a painful and moderately swollen left wrist. His past medical history was unremarkable. Standard anteroposterior and lateral X-rays of his left wrist revealed two osteolytic lesions involving the distal ulna and the lunate fossa of the distal radius without any joint involvement (Fig. , ). Subsequent biopsy of his left ulna under regional anesthesia produced brown spongy material, histologically characterized by the presence of large numbers of multinucleated giant cells and spindle cells in a dense collagenous background. These findings were histologically consistent with a diagnosis of GCT and correlation with the clinical and radiological findings was recommended by the pathologist. As he had no other skeletal manifestations, a complete resection of the distal ulna (9.5 cm length) followed, along with curettage and cementoplasty of the distal radial metaphysis, to support the articular surface (Fig. , ). The resected distal ulna specimen and the curettings from the distal radius were submitted for histopathological evaluation; our patient was discharged 2 days later, with a forearm cast and instructions to attend the clinic in 2 weeks\u2019 time for re-evaluation and removal of sutures.\nTwo weeks postoperatively, he was re-admitted to our orthopedic department with diffuse musculoskeletal soreness, anorexia, constipation, nausea, and localized abdominal pain. He also reported weight loss of approximately 5 kg. On palpation he had tenderness in the thoracic wall, the second and fifth metacarpals of his right hand, the left tibia, the pelvic ring, and the left shoulder girdle and humerus. Plain radiographs revealed multiple osteolytic lesions in his ribs, right hand, left tibia, and scapula (Fig. \u2013).\nA histopathological examination of both the resected ulna (Fig. \u2013) and the curettings of the radius (Fig. ) revealed similar findings: numerous, multinucleated, osteoclast-type giant cells were noted amid a mononuclear, spindle cell, histiocytoid component (Fig. ). Many of the giant cells were clustered in large nodular aggregates separated by fibrous septa containing fibroblast-like spindle cells. The spindle cell component showed no evidence of atypia or sarcomatoid features (Fig. ). There were prominent foci of hemorrhage with relatively restricted hemosiderin deposition (Fig. ). Mitoses were observed (up to five mitotic figures/ten high power fields) but no atypical mitoses or necrosis were seen. On the resection specimen of the ulna, the lesion focally disrupted the cortex producing periosteal reaction with woven bone trabeculae, extending in the surrounding adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (Fig. ). Based on the similar findings of both lesions and the rarity of multifocal GCT of bone the histopathology report included in the differential diagnosis a BT of hyperparathyroidism, either primary or in the setting of a paraneoplastic PTH-like protein production and suggested further patient evaluation.\nOur patient\u2019s laboratory examination showed high total serum calcium (14.5 mg/dl, normal range 8.8\u201310.4), low serum phosphorus (2.3 mg/dl, normal range 2.5\u20134.5), and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (9.74 ng/ml, normal range > 30). PHPT was suspected and confirmed by the elevated PTH levels of 1453 pg/mL (normal range 15\u201365). Serum potassium and sodium concentrations and thyroid hormone levels were in reference range as well as the main cancer indicators: cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 125, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Serum protein electrophoresis was also normal. His human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was elevated (25.3 mUl/ml, reference level < 5). An isotope bone scan showed multiple sites of uptake over his ribs bilaterally, the lower pole of both scapulae, multiple foci in his pelvis, the metacarpal bones of his right hand, and his right tibia. At subsequent radiological work-up, both computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography of his neck revealed a 4.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 3.2 cm mass emanating from the right lobe of his thyroid gland. Parathyroid subtraction technetium-99m (99mTc) sestamibi (MIBI) scintigraphy showed extensive uptake in his right lower parathyroid gland (Fig. ). Multiple endocrine neoplasia was excluded because of the normal MRI imaging of his pituitary gland.\nAppropriate medical care was given to our patient including hyperhydration and high doses of diuretics and diphosphonates. After his health status improved and his serum calcium nearly normalized, a specialist surgeon was consulted for further surgical treatment. Surgery consisted of extensive resection: total thyroidectomy with removal of the parathyroid glands. A mass measuring 4.8 cm in greatest diameter, abutting the thyroid gland was documented at surgery. The mass was surrounded by a thick capsule, had a tan-brown, solid, and microcystic cut surface, and rubbery consistency. On histologic examination, the tumor comprised small cells with minimal to scanty cytoplasm and round nuclei, arranged in an organoid pattern, with frequent perivascular pseudorosettes. Thick fibrous septa emanating from the capsule were noted within the tumor. There was capsular invasion, with extension of neoplastic groups in the surrounding loose connective tissue adjacent to striated muscle, and foci of vascular invasion in the tumor capsule. The histologic findings were consistent with a parathyroid carcinoma. The neoplasm did not appear to invade the adjacent thyroid lobe and did not involve the margins of resection.\nOur patient experienced postoperatively persistent hypocalcemia requiring calcium and vitamin D replacement. His condition was characterized as \u201chungry bone syndrome.\u201d He is now recovering 12 months after surgery, with a serum PTH level of 7.1 pg/mL and serum calcium level of 10.7 mg/dl and he is under calcium and vitamin D replacement therapy.

{"clinical_note": "On March 2017, a male, caucasian, 56-year-old, non-smoker patient came to our observation. He was employed as a truck driver. Remote clinical history included hepatitis, nasal polyposis treated with functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), chronic sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) undergone laparoscopic GERD surgery (fundoplication). In 2016, a diagnosis of non-allergic asthma was made. Skin prick tests were negative. Respiratory function tests showed a moderate obstruction (FEV1 2.20 L, 68% of predicted; FEV1/FVC 67%) without bronchial reversibility after 400 \u03bcg of inhaled salbutamol. A few months later, after normalization of lung function parameters following maximal therapy, a positive bronchial provocation test with methacholine showed a degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness congruent with the diagnosis of bronchial asthma (PDV20 FEV1 136 mcg). Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were negative. The therapy included formoterol/fluticasone metered-dose inhaler 250/10 \u03bcg, two inhalations twice daily and as needed (twice a day on an average), tiotropium bromide 2.5 \u03bcg soft mist inhaler, montelukast 10 mg/day. Due to frequent exacerbations and poor control of asthma, systemic corticosteroids (either oral or parenteral) had to be prescribed for over 6 months and 7 unscheduled visits were required in the previous year.\nOn February 2017 a chest high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan showed only mild fibrotic scarring in the anterior basal segment of the lower right lung lobe. On September 2017 the patient received a first session of BT, in the lower right lobe, without any tolerability problem. Three days before the procedure systemic oral corticosteroids (prednisone 50 mg/day) were administered according to usual protocol, to control potential exacerbation of airway inflammation. Immediately before bronchoscopy, inhaled bronchodilators (nebulized salbutamol and ipratropium bromide) were given, along with nebulized lidocaine to provide topical anesthesia. Atropine 0.4\u20130.6 mg was administered intravenously 15\u201330 min before the procedure to minimize secretions. According to our procedure, the patient is placed under moderate sedation, a peripheral intravenous (IV) line is taken and supplemental oxygen is administered. The bronchoscope is positioned at the first treatment site, usually the most distal airway in the targeted lobe and the Alair Catheter is introduced through the working channel. The electrode array at the tip of the Catheter is expanded to contact the airway wall. The bronchoscopist activates the RF Controller to deliver low-power, temperature-controlled RF energy to the airway; the energy transfer ends automatically upon completion of the cycle (about 10 s). A single activation of the Catheter delivers RF energy over a distance of approximately 5 mm. After each procedure there is a 1\u20132 days hospitalization with monitoring of vital parameters and control of chest radiography. On October 5, 2017 a second BT session was performed in the left lower lobe, according to the same procedure. On October 23, persistent haemoptysis appeared requiring patient admission to our ward. On physical examination there was a reduction of breath sounds at the left pulmonary base. The patient underwent a new chest CT scan: around the basal anterior segmental branch line of the left lower lobe, mild varicoid bronchiectasis and distal parenchymal infiltrate were present, in addition to mild signs of airway inflammation in the right lower lobe (Fig. a). A fibreoptic bronchoscopy showed two small nodular neoformations in the sub-segmental branches of the same lobe (Fig. b). Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with radial probe exploration of the left lower lobar bronchus was also performed with evidence of peripheral infiltrate, sampled with four trans-bronchial biopsies. These changes were not present on endoscopy at the time of the BT procedure, and were detected only after the appearance of haemoptysis.\nOn histological examination bronchial mucosa showed mild non-specific inflammation. Some large fragments of peribronchial pulmonary parenchyma (Fig. d) presented an area of haemorrhagic necrosis, with blood and fibrin, hemosiderin deposits and organizing pneumonia (Fig. d, e). No neoplastic cells were observed. Infectious agents were excluded after histochemical staining with Grocott and Ziehl\u2013Nielsen methods. Microbiological cultures for aerobe and anaerobe bacteria were negative as well as cultures for mycobacteria. The patient was treated empirically with co-amoxiclav 1 g three times and azithromycin 500 mg daily for 6 days and prednisone 25 mg per day for 10 days. On December 18, a new chest CT showed a complete resolution of the parenchymal opacities (Fig. f). On January 9, 2018, the patient underwent the third session of BT, without recurrence of haemoptysis or subsequent radiological changes.

{"clinical_note": "A 54-year-old Caucasian male presented with an enlarging right neck mass in November, 2015. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was performed on the mass at that time which showed malignant cells consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. The patient did not have follow-up or further treatment at that time due to socioeconomic issues. His past medical history is significant for alcoholism, tobacco abuse, noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. For the next sixteen months, he reported three flares of painful neck adenopathy. He sought treatment, and short courses of antibiotics and steroids were administered each time.\nIn March of 2017, his latest flare of right-sided neck adenopathy did not respond to antibiotics and steroid treatment course. He presented to the Emergency Department and found to have a grossly palpable mass in the right neck. He reported no symptoms of fevers, chills, night sweats, fatigue, or weight loss. Computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple low-density cystic structures in the right neck consistent with necrotic lymph nodes. The lymph nodes ranged in size from 1.4 cm to 2.9 cm in greatest dimension. No additional masses were detected in nasopharynx, oropharynx, or larynx. At this point, the patient was admitted for further workup and management. PET-CT showed right neck hypermetabolic uptake ranging from SUV of 4.3 to 4.5, and a CT of the chest showed no obvious disease and no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Following an FNA suggestive of either an anaplastic carcinoma or a hematolymphoid neoplasm, an excisional biopsy of the neck mass was performed.\nHematoxylin and eosin- (H&E-) stained right neck mass excisional biopsy material demonstrated lymph node and soft tissue with sinusoidal infiltration of large atypical monomorphic cells with round nuclei, occasional prominent central nucleoli, and abundant amphophilic cytoplasm. The lymph node was mostly effaced by tumor cells, but the uninvolved areas appeared unremarkable and showed residual small mature lymphocytes ().\nAn extensive immunohistochemical panel was performed to aid the diagnosis with appropriate reactive controls (Figures and ). The tumor cells expressed CD45, weak CD38, CD138, and EMA. ALK-1 showed a restricted granular cytoplasmic staining pattern highly suggestive of CLTC-ALK fusion protein expression. MIB-1/Ki-67 was approximately 80%. Interestingly, the tumor cells also showed strong and diffuse CD33 expression. The tumor cells were negative for PAX-5, myeloperoxidase (MPO), TIA-1, EBV, HHV8, CD2, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD20, CD30, CD34, CD79a, and kappa/lambda light chains. Other nonhematopoietic immunostains including CK OSCAR, CK7, melan-A, CK5/6, p40, and p63 were negative. Flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and FISH studies were not performed on the sample. Based on the morphology and immunohistochemistry, a diagnosis of ALK+ LBCL was rendered. The case was also reviewed at NIH, and the diagnosis was confirmed.

{"clinical_note": "A 41-year-old man, a native from Rio de Janeiro and an HIV and HCV carrier, without criteria for the treatment for HCV (detectable viral load, without cirrhosis and with normal transaminase levels), who had abandoned ART, had attended the Gaffre\u00e9 and Guinle University Hospital's immunology clinic complaining about continuous epigastric burning pain without irradiation and with diffuse abdominal pain that was mild and continuous, which had started approximately two months prior to admission. He also complained about intense hematochezia that had started three weeks before, with intense flow and with \u201cpure blood\u201d appearance without clots. He presented with daily hyperthermia since the abdominal symptoms had started with intermittent high fever and an over 10% body weight loss in the same period. The physical examination revealed oral candidiasis, bleached mucous membranes, and cachexia. At the admission time, the HIV viral load was recorded at 905,569 copies per ml, and the TCD4 lymphocyte count was 144 cells/dL. Prophylactic sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 400/80 mg 2 IV ampoules once daily and fluconazole 200 mg IV once daily for treatment of the oral candidiasis were prescribed. The patient's condition evolved without major occurrences or complaints, presented with high fever, above 38\u00b0C almost every day. Blood counts revealed thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, anemia, microcytosis, and anisocytosis (). The medical team requested upper digestive endoscopy () and colonoscopy (), which verified the presence of ulcer with irregular and raised edges, fibrinonecrotic base, measuring approximately 3 cm in the middle third of the esophagus and 30 cm from the incisors and the mild antrum gastritis, and swollen, irregular, and fibrinous ulcers in the ileocecal valve, descending colon, and all other segments. The lesions were similar to those found in the esophagus, which could suggest the same etiology. It was suggested by the internal medicine team that the diagnosis could be a coinfection (tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus disease). The diagnosis of tuberculosis and cytomegalovirus coinfection of the gastrointestinal tract was confirmed by the histopathological report (Ziehl\u2013Neelsen staining of acid-fast bacilli, CMV intracytoplasmic inclusions in Giemsa staining, and immunohistochemical study with positive labeling for CMV in cells with clear halos), and some time later, culture with the growth of M. tuberculosis (). Treatment was started with an RIPE scheme (rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol) 4 tablets daily and ganciclovir 350 mg IV for 21 days with a weight gain of 4 kg and clinical and laboratory improvement. He was discharged from the hospital with ART lamivudine, tenofovir, and efavirenz (TDF + 3TC + EFV) one tablet per day and was referred to a clinical follow-up for tuberculosis and HIV/HCV coinfection monitoring. At the end of the treatment for tuberculosis and 6 months after ART was restarted, the patient's viral load was <40 copies/dL and the CD4+ T-cell count was 356 cells/dL, asymptomatic.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

I123 thyroid scan revealed elevated, diffuse uptake bilaterally, without nodules, consistent with the diagnosis of Graves' disease. The patient was treated with 11.9 mCi of radioactive iodine. Ten days after the ablation treatment, the patient presented to a local hospital by ambulance after experiencing lightheadedness, diffuse abdominal pain, and one episode of bilious emesis.\nUpon arrival, she was hypotensive (77/44 mm Hg), pale, bradycardic, and febrile (39.4\u00b0C). An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed accelerated junctional rhythm at a rate of 53 beats/min. The patient was given atropine 0.5 mg intravenously without effect, followed by initiation of external cardiac pacing. Continuous intravenous infusions of dopamine and norepinephrine were started along with fluid resuscitation of 4 L of normal saline over a 2-hour period. She received one ampule of calcium gluconate with no change in her blood pressure, heart rate, or rhythm. Computed tomography of the abdomen was unrevealing.

Limited physical exam was revealing for increased tone and rigidity in bilateral lower extremities while the patient self-dialogued and yelled at times. Per outside records, he was observed to be persistently agitated, engaging in self-injurious behaviors such as hitting himself, banging his head, and refusing to eat or drink for a week.\nThree weeks prior, he was admitted to the medicine service with early signs of NMS that resolved over the course of a few days with discontinuation of neuroleptics and treatment with parenteral lorazepam. He was subsequently transferred back to the outside hospital psychiatric unit for further stabilization and optimization of his psychotropic regimen, with a recommendation to avoid high-potency neuroleptics. There, he was started on fluphenazine, a high-potency first generation antipsychotic, after a washout period of one week. His religious delusions with disorganized thought process showed minimal improvement. He was subsequently switched to haloperidol, which was rapidly increased to 35 mg per day. Clonazepam 1.5 mg per day and lorazepam 1 mg per day were also utilized over this time frame. The patient, however, became increasingly agitated, with self-injurious behavior and some posturing that was attributed to \u201crefractory psychosis.\u201d This prompted further antipsychotic dose escalation. He had stopped eating or drinking by this time with associated worsening of behavioral dysregulation. 75 mg of chlorpromazine was given the same day after 35 mg of haloperidol showed minimal benefit. While chlorpromazine temporarily decreased his behavioral dysregulation, his agitation continued unabated the following morning. He was given additional chlorpromazine 25 mg with fluid resuscitation in urgent care before his transfer to our facility for a delirium work-up.\nOn arrival, standard treatment was implemented, including antipsychotic discontinuation, supportive care, and initiation of parenteral benzodiazepines consisting of lorazepam 2 mg intravenously (IV) every 8 hours. His complete blood count, electrolytes, vitamin B12, thyroid function, and liver function tests were within normal limits, except for a CK of 1090 IU/L, mildly elevated 10,680 white blood cells per mcL, low iron level of 26 ug/dL, and creatinine value of 1.26 mg/dL thought to be prerenal in nature secondary to dehydration. He tested negative for syphilis on the rapid plasma reagin test. Urinalysis did not reveal an infection. Urine drug toxicology was positive for benzodiazepines only, which the patient had been receiving on the inpatient unit. A head CT revealed no acute intracranial pathology. An electroencephalogram performed on day 4 of admission was notable only for increased beta waves, reflecting the high-dose benzodiazepines he was receiving at the time.\nThe patient's hospital course was notable for continued fluctuating motor symptoms with episodes of severe rigidity in both upper and lower extremities, intermittent droning vocalizations, waxy flexibility, posturing, negativism, automatic obedience, and presence of mitgehen. Such periods were accompanied by diaphoresis and autonomic hyperactivity. On the fifth day, lorazepam was increased to 4 mg IV every 4 hours and amantadine 100 mg (by mouth) PO twice a day was started the following day. The doses were held past midnight due to planned ECT on the seventh day of admission. Lorazepam was resumed post-ECT but amantadine was held until after the third session. Prior to each subsequent ECT treatment, benzodiazepines were held to prevent increasing the patient's seizure threshold. He received a total of three ECT sessions, each three days apart. In between the second and the third ECT sessions, the patient became overtly delirious secondary to a urinary tract infection, which was treated with antibiotics. After the second ECT session, lorazepam was decreased to 2 mg IV every 6 hours and then switched to a longer acting diazepam 20 mg IV every 6 hours after the third ECT session. Amantadine was restarted at the same dose and was increased to 100 mg PO three times a day, four days after the last ECT session. After a three-week washout period, Clozapine 12.5 mg PO twice a day was introduced for underlying psychotic symptoms and titrated to 25 mg twice a day without recurrence of NMS or catatonia.

After excluding birth canal laceration and retaining placental tissue, the obstetrician began IV fluid and uterotonic treatment, but the bleeding continued. She was then transferred to our hospital due to PPH. However, when she arrived, she had severe tachycardia (heart rate, 160 bpm) and hypotension (BP, 44/34 mmHg). Her consciousness was clear, but she was agitated. We immediately began transfusion of packed red blood cells (6 units), fresh frozen plasma (4 units), apheresis platelets (2 units), and whole blood (2 units) as we simultaneously examined the patient. Signs of DIC developed with continuous blood loss (), and her consciousness deteriorated within 30 minutes after arriving at the emergency department.\nUterine atony and an ischemic uterus were found during emergency laparotomy. A subtotal hysterectomy was completed. Intraoperative blood loss was 800 mL. The patient was transferred to the ICU after surgery. Her postoperative fibrinogen level was 54.6 mg/dL (normal: 200\u2013400 mg/dL). We transfused fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate to achieve a fibrinogen level greater than 100 mg/dL. However, unstable blood pressure and progressive abdominal distension were found 4 hours after the primary surgery. We rushed the patient back into surgery due to suspicion of internal bleeding. Hemoperitoneum of 2000 mL and active bleeding from ruptured pararectal vessels were identified. After the secondary surgery for ligation of the bleeding vessels, the patient had acute kidney injury with anuria, intractable hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis.

Abdominal CT was indicated to confirm the characteristic of the lesion but was postponed due to the patient's poor renal function. After consultation with a gastrointestinal expert, the lesion was thought to be a liver abscess or focal necrosis due to ischemic change. Her consciousness had been deteriorating since post-PPH day 20 in combination with intractable fever. Brain CT showed no intracranial lesion. Worsening cognition was likely due to metabolic encephalopathy of hepatic or infectious origin.\nA liver transplantation was indicated, and a pretransplantation CT scan showed poor enhancement of the right hepatic lobe on the periphery covering about 50% of the total area, which was suggestive of liver infarction (). Living donor liver transplantation was performed 28 days after PPH. The donor was her younger brother, and the graft liver weight was 840 gm. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1.24%. Intraoperatively, there were multiple micronodular lesions on the liver surface with marked swelling of the liver parenchyma and diffuse devitalized liver tissue in the right lobe of liver with necrosis and in the left lobe peripheral zone accounting for about 70%\u201380 % of the total liver volume (Figures and ).\nThe patient's bilirubin level improved on the first three days but increased again on the 4th day after transplantation.

The patient did not have a previous endoscopy prior to this one.\nInfused computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and chest showed mild GEJ thickness with no evidence of mediastinal or celiac lymphadenopathy and no signs of metastasis. It also demonstrated a large heterogeneously enhancing mass about 6 \u00d7 9.5 cm with central necrosis in the upper abdomen that appears to be originating from the gastric antrum (greater curve). The mass was highly suggestive of GIST based on CT; it was the same mass that was previously misdiagnosed as a liver hemangioma (). Endoscopic ultrasound confirmed the previous findings. However, no biopsy was attempted due to the risk of bleeding.\nHistopathological examination of the GEJ polyp revealed tubulovillous adenoma with elements of adenocarcinoma in situ. The patient was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of early-stage adenocarcinoma of GEJ along with the incidental finding of enlarging gastric GIST. A trial of endoscopic mucosal resection of GEJ polyp was attempted but failed because of the polyp location that created a technical difficulty. Therefore, the patient was taken to the operating room with a plan to perform a wedge resection of the gastric mass and a submucosal resection of GEJ polyp through the same gastric opening. We planned to use frozen section (FS) to document negative margin resection and determine the need for a formal esophagectomy. Intraoperatively; a large (10 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 cm), extraluminal pedunculated mass was found at the posterior wall of the greater curvature of the stomach (). Wedge resection of the gastric mass with negative margins was achieved along with a transgastric submucosal resection of the GEJ polyp. Fortunately, the FS examination of the polyp showed negative margins as well with no evidence of deep invasion. Postoperatively, the patient had a smooth course and was discharged home in a stable condition. The final pathological examination revealed a GEJ polyp around 1.7 \u00d7 1.4 \u00d7 0.6 cm. Microscopically, there was a focus of invasive adenocarcinoma involving the superficial submucosa of the polypoid lesion, negative margins, and no lymphovascular invasion (T1a NxM0). Furthermore, the gastric wall mass measured around 10 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 cm with a 2 \u00d7 1.5 cm stalk. Histopathology revealed encapsulated high-grade epithelioid GIST tumor with negative margins (pT3). The mitotic rate of 6/50 HPF and immunohistochemical stains were positive for DOG1 and CD34 but negative for CD117 (c-Kit) ().\nThe final diagnosis was synchronous early-stage GEJ adenocarcinoma and a high-grade gastric GIST. Therefore, the patient was started on adjuvant imatinib treatment, along with endoscopic surveillance every six months and proton pump inhibitors.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 25-year-old G3 P0020 at 36 3/7 weeks of gestational age with a singleton pregnancy presents with acute-onset, severe back pain and fever. Pain was described as constant, aching, and sharp. Her prenatal course was significant for multiple left antecubital abscesses requiring drainage (culture positive for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) at 34 weeks and she was treated with clindamycin. On initial questioning, she admitted daily tobacco use but denied intravenous drug use. She was afebrile on presentation, but nodularity was appreciated at the left antecubital fossa and she had lower back tenderness to palpation. Physical exam was otherwise unremarkable. Biophysical profile and nonstress test confirmed a reassuring fetal status.\nInitial white blood cell count (WBC) was 21 [K/uL], C-reactive protein (CRP) was 27 [mg/L], and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 63 [mm/hour]. Urine toxicology screening was negative. Empiric treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated after she developed hypotension and a fever. Preliminary blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci, later found to be positive for MRSA. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lumbar spine was obtained because of severe lower back pain that did not resolve with analgesia. This study revealed a small dorsal spinal collection with edema in the left psoas muscle. Neurologic reflexes were intact and serial neurologic exams were normal.\nBack pain continued to increase, and the patient developed weakness of bilateral lower extremities. Given the concern for acute structural damage to the spinal cord, the patient was counseled regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives to contrast imaging during pregnancy and opted for MRI with gadolinium intravenous contrast []. This was repeated after two days of antibiotic therapy to assess for further progression of abscess. MRI revealed an epidural abscess from T5-6 to T8-9 causing mild thecal cord compression and a collection from L4 to S1 (see Figures and ). Because of concern for worsening neurologic symptoms of lower extremity weakness and difficulty ambulating, cesarean delivery was performed followed by laminectomy (T5-10) and decompression of the epidural abscess. Intraoperative cultures were obtained and were positive for MRSA. Cesarean delivery was uncomplicated. Neonate weighed 2690 grams with Apgar score of 8 and 9 and was treated with vancomycin and gentamycin for suspected sepsis. Placental pathology and cultures were negative.\nPostoperative course was complicated by persistent MRSA bacteremia. Repeat MRI revealed residual abscess from T6-T9, with cord compression at T6-T7, and a left psoas muscle collection (see ). Three days later, reexploration and laminectomy from T4-T7 were performed and antibiotic treatment was continued with vancomycin and ceftaroline fosamil. During her extended hospital course, she admitted to previous illicit drug use but denied current use. However, there was a high suspicion for intravenous drug use due to her poor pain tolerance and history of antecubital abscesses. Later in her clinical course she endorsed a history of intravenous drug use. Once blood cultures were negative, she was discharged home in stable condition to continue long-term antibiotic therapy. Lower extremity weakness had resolved at time of discharge; however, she continues to have residual weakness, pain, and incontinence.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

The rash had started on her upper extremities and then spread to her face, chest, and thighs 2 days prior to admission. At times, the rash had been itchy and the patient had reported chills. She had been started on clozapine 10 days prior to admission. On admission she was febrile to 38.1\u00b0C, tachycardic to 113 bpm, and hypotensive to 96/63. On exam, she had a maculopapular rash that was nonblanching over her entire body except her lower legs. There was no mucosal involvement, but she had mild facial edema. Pertinent admission labs included WBC 6.9 (3.7\u201311.4 103/\u00b5L), Hgb 10.6 (10.8\u201315.3 g/dL), platelet 196 (140\u2013393 K/\u00b5L), eosinophils 10 (0\u20136%), eosinophils absolute 0.7 (0.0\u20130.5 103/\u00b5L), aspartate aminotransferase 81 (14\u201336 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 125 (9\u201352 U/L), alkaline phosphatase 155 (38\u2013126 U/L), and hepatitis C antibody positive. Her urinalysis showed moderate leukocyte esterase with white blood cells, squamous cells, and few bacteria. Imaging on admission included chest X-ray, which showed a small left sided pleural effusion. A CT chest was done which showed minimal bilateral atelectasis with trace pleural effusions and cholelithiasis with contracted gallbladder and pericholecystic fluid.\nAt this point, there was concern for infectious etiology, and blood cultures were drawn. The patient was then started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with cefepime and vancomycin. Clozapine was stopped and her benztropine and lithium were initially continued as she had been on these for many years. After being seen by psychiatry, they were also discontinued. She was given Benadryl for her rash. Hepatitis C viral PCR pathogens were found to be negative. Blood cultures grew staphylococcus coagulase negative and urine culture showed mixed flora with no infection. The blood cultures were thought to be a contaminant, so they were redrawn and the second set did not grow anything. Antibiotics were discontinued, as there was no further concern for infectious etiology. Eosinophils continued to be elevated and she developed a leukocytosis. The next three days, her white blood cell count continued to rise and peaked at 26.5 103/\u00b5L. She had worsening fever and became more tachycardic. Liver enzymes continued to rise, so an ultrasound abdomen was performed due to concern for cholecystitis, which was negative. Antibiotics were restarted due to concern for infection. Her eosinophil count rose and peaked at 14%. She had an echocardiogram to rule out endocarditis, which was within normal limits. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast was done to rule out an abdominal infection. It showed colon thickening, cholelithiasis, trace pleural effusions, and porta hepatis lymphadenopathy. Antibiotics were all discontinued again as infectious etiologies had been ruled out. At this point, there was concern for drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome) as she had the classic signs of DRESS including eosinophilia, skin rash, lymphadenopathy, and elevated liver enzymes. Other viral exanthema reactivations that are associated with DRESS were also considered. EBV, HHV-6, and HHV-7 were drawn, and all came back negative. Mononucleosis testing was not done on presentation although this can present as DRESS syndrome.\nDermatology was also consulted and agreed that this was DRESS syndrome. Methylprednisone IV 125 mg three times daily was started along with clobetasol twice a day. After starting prednisone, fever and white blood cell count improved. Eosinophils trended back down to normal limits and liver enzymes started trending down. She was discharged on an oral prednisone taper for 12 days. Outpatient follow-up did not show any further eosinophilia, white blood cell elevation, or elevated liver enzymes.

Due to acute onset conscious disturbance (Glasgow Coma Scale of E3VaM5) in the hospital, brain computed tomography was arranged and revealed an enhanced brain tumor with necrotic cystic change. This tumor was located at the left temporal lobe with upward extension to the left basal ganglion and periventricular region, causing perifocal edema and midline shift (). We performed emergent craniectomy for tumor removal in December 2006.\nPathology revealed pleomorphic, hyperchromatic cells with glassy, astrocytic cytoplasm, as well as hypercellularity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis, consistent with the diagnosis of classic GBM ().\nThe patient underwent radiotherapy 1 month later and followed by chemotherapy with temozolomide for 6 months. Her performance status improved to a Karnofsky Grade of 70, and her clinical condition was stable thereafter. However, follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in June 2014 revealed a new enhanced nodular lesion, approximately 1.1 cm in diameter, at the left temporal base. The brain MRI in October 2014 revealed a progressive change of lesions, maximum 3.0 cm in diameter (). Thus, she again received surgery for gross tumor removal.\nHistologically, except for the necrosis feature of GBM, the tumors showed the oligodendroglial component. Neoplastic cells also showed isocitrate dehydrogenase 1(IDH1)(+), p53(diffuse +), and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)(\u2212) as revealed by immunostaining ().\nDuring follow-up, signs of increased intracranial pressure were noted in May 2015.

{"clinical_note": "A 38-year-old male was referred to the outpatient clinic at the Department of Nephrology with treatment-resistant hypertension, rapidly developing edema and overt proteinuria (week 11, Fig. A). The patient was initially followed at the outpatient clinic at the Department of Endocrinology with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes for 15 years with microvascular complications including retinopathy and albuminuria, thus presenting with urinary albumin/creatinine ratios over 1000 mg/g for at least 3 years. There were no clinical signs of neuropathy. Plasma creatinine had previously been normal, in the range 60\u201390 \u03bcmol/L. Through several years, the patient had hypertension that was well-controlled with ACE inhibitors. One year prior to the presentation, blood pressure increased progressively concomitant with development of edema. The patient presented with severe hypertension (200/140 mmHg, week 0, Fig. B), edema and urinary protein excretion at 18.5 g/24 h (week 1, Fig. D). Despite increasing doses and numbers of antihypertensive agents and diuretics (Fig. A), blood pressure continued to be severely elevated combined with progressive fluid overload and proteinuria (Fig. B and D). The patient was referred to the Department of Nephrology (week 11, Fig. A\u2013D) with NS. At this time, a renography performed on treatment with an ARB revealed no perfusion of the right kidney, and ultrasound confirmed the presence of a 4 cm long, hypoechoic structure in the right retroperitoneal space believed to be a rudimentary right kidney. The left kidney was morphologically and scintigraphically normal. The antihypertensive medication at referral was thiazide, beta-blocker, calcium channel antagonist, ACE-inhibitor and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone with no suspicion of noncompliance (Fig. A). At presentation, the patient was alert but complained of headache, fatigue, and recent weight gain of 10 kg. On physical examination, blood pressure was 161/102 mmHg, and the patient revealed periorbital and universal pitting edema, no signs of ascites and otherwise normal examination. Based on edema, proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia (25 g/L), he was diagnosed with NS assumed to be related to diabetes. There was negative test for M-component and no detectable autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA, anti-GBA) nor phospholipase A2 antibody. Hepatitis B and C as well as HIV serology were negative. To reduce blood pressure, treatment with a loop diuretic was initiated (furosemide 80 mg/day, Fig. A). After 2 weeks without effect on edema and blood pressure (Fig. B and D), with a decrease in eGFR and no change in plasma potassium (Fig. C), furosemide was stepped up to 160 mg/day (Fig. A). Despite treatment with five combined antihypertensive/diuretic agents, there was only a minor weight loss (~1 kg) and reduction in blood pressure. Therefore, a low dose of the ENaC blocker amiloride 5 mg/day was initiated (Fig. A) and a 7-day follow-up was scheduled, which the patient missed. At next contact after 2 weeks, this treatment resulted in effective resolution of edema, concomitant weight loss of 7 kg and reduction in blood pressure from 150/100 mmHg to 125/81 mmHg (Fig. B). The patient continued his normal diet and 24 h urinary sodium excretion increased from 127 mmol/day to 165 mmol/day. Proteinuria decreased from 8 g/day to 4.1 g/day (Fig. D), eGFR decreased from 41 mL/min to 29 mL/min and plasma potassium concentration increased from 4.6 to 7.8 mmol/L (Fig. C).

The patient had been at her usual baseline state of health with no significant past medical history prior to visiting the chiropractor for neck adjustment earlier that day for tension like soreness. The patient underwent neck manipulation after which she immediately complained of neck pain, diaphoresis, and proceeded to experience cardiac and respiratory arrest. Emergency Medical Services was called, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed with one round of epinephrine administered. It was reported that the patient was pulseless and apneic for 3 minutes prior to EMS arrival. The patient was intubated on transport and her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3T prior to arrival. Mean arterial blood pressure was 80 with palpable femoral pulses at arrival to the emergency department. Upon arrival in the emergency department, a CT stroke protocol was performed which demonstrated bilateral severe distal cervical vertebral artery dissections with acute thrombotic emboli seen in the left cervical vertebral artery ( and ). This was accompanied by complete occlusion of the basilar tip including the proximal posterior cervical arteries.\nThe patient received an initial bolus of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) at this time and the decision was made to proceed with endovascular intervention given the recent onset of occlusion. The patient was brought to the neurovascular angiography suite and femoral access obtained. Angiography of the left vertebral artery demonstrated severe dissection involving the distal cervical vertebral artery segments at the C1-C2 level with presence of sub occlusive thrombi. There was an occlusive clot in the left Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA). Intracranial imaging demonstrated occlusion at the basilar apex with absent filling into the right Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA). There was occlusion of the distal left PCA. Angiography of the right vertebral artery demonstrated severe dissection of the distal cervical vertebral artery at C1-C2 with the presence of trickle-like flow into the vertebrobasilar junction. No filling was observed in the right PICA territory (). At this point, it was decided that the left vertebral artery offered the best access to the basilar trunk.\nSubsequently, distal aspiration was begun with a Penumbra 5 Max ACE distal aspiration catheter which initially demonstrated slow flow through the suction tubing. The 5 Max ACE was withdrawn into the proximal basilar artery until flow was seen within the suction tubing. Repeat angiography at this time demonstrated recanalization of the basilar apex and proximal PCAs. TICI3 perfusion was seen in the right PCA. Occlusive clot remained in the left distal P2 segment. Given the large size of the PCA, timing of events, and patient\u2019s age, the decision was made to attempt clot retrieval of this. At this time, the Trevo ProVue microcatheter was navigated into the left distal PCA distal to the clot. The Trevo 4 mm \u00d7 30 mm stent retriever was deployed for approximately 3 minutes. The suction canister was attached, and the stent retriever was pulled with distal aspiration. No significant recanalization was achieved with what amounted to TICI0 perfusion to the left PCA territory. No further attempts were made as it was believed that the left PCA territory had completed its infarction.\nFollowing completion of endovascular therapy, the patient was taken for immediate MRI Brain with and without contrast for assessment of brainstem integrity and cerebrovascular status prior to transport to the intensive care unit. MRI demonstrated extensive areas of restricted diffusion accompanied by perfusion abnormalities consistent with acute infarction of the posterior circulation, specifically within the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, right medulla, pons bilaterally, midbrain, thalami, and left occipital lobe ().

He then developed progressive back and radicular abdominal pain. Imaging revealed the growth of the right prevertebral lesion to 4.4 x 4.0 x 6.2 cm and the growth of the right paraspinal lesion to 4.7 x 4.0 x 7.5 cm (Figure ). Neither tumor had changes concerning for malignant degeneration. Given the tumor locations, the progression of the patient\u2019s comorbidities, and his predisposition to develop malignancy, he was not felt to be a good candidate for surgical excision or radiosurgery. For these reasons, he was referred to interventional radiology for image-guided RFA. The procedure was performed with the aid of anesthesia. Under CT guidance, a 17G 3-cm burn radius ablation needle (Cool-tip, Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA) was advanced to each of the lesions, with a 12-minute burn cycle performed at each site (Figure , Figure ). He had no complications.\nAt six weeks post-ablation, the right prevertebral lesion had decreased in size to 3.4 x 3.5 x 5.4 cm and the right paraspinal lesion now measured 3.3 x 4.2 x 6.3 cm (figure not shown). Six months after the procedure, he reported his pain had improved. He no longer required methadone for pain control. On the most recent imaging performed four years after the ablation, the anterior prevertebral lesion shows stable regression at 2.9 x 3.3 x 3.5 cm with the posterior paraspinal lesion further decreasing in size to 2.6 x 3.6 x 5.1 cm (Figure ).

The patient also described the recent appearance of a glabellar lesion. Several weeks prior to our consultation, the patient sought the care of his primary care physician, who incised this newer lesion hoping to drain it. When this procedure was unsuccessful, the patient was referred for further treatment.\nUpon physical examination, the patient was found to have an extensive rhinophyma and additional lesions of the nasal glabella and right upper forehead regions (Figures , ). The rhinophyma measured 6.7 centimeters (cm) in diameter. The patient reported that it had been enlarging for six years. Observation revealed an irregular, nodular tumor with telangiectasia and sebum inspissation. The glabellar lesion measured 3.0 cm in diameter and appeared as a discrete erythematous tumor with central ulceration and necrosis. The location of this lesion on non-sebaceous skin suggested a non-rhinophymatous lesion and raised our suspicion for malignancy. An additional 1.5 cm lesion of the right forehead region appeared as a round, telangiectatic nodule with a waxy border. A preoperative diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma for this separate lesion was confirmed by the pathological report.\nSurgery was performed on the nasal lesions. The rhinophyma was excised and debulked, then closed with adjacent cheek flaps and skin graft. The glabellar lesion extended to the left medial canthal area. It was treated with wide local excision and was closed with forehead flaps. Frozen section analysis of the glabellar specimen revealed a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The area of rhinophyma on the lower portion of the nose displayed no evidence of lymphoma. After a three-week interval, the basal cell carcinoma of the right forehead was removed, and closure was accomplished with double opposing V-Y advancement flaps (Figures , ).\nThe final pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with BCL6 positivity. The patient was referred to an oncologist for further treatment. Subsequent oncological workup revealed several positive lymph nodes in the anterior cervical chain. One such node was biopsied by a general surgeon and was found to be positive for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord revealed left cerebellar expansive lesion with no evidence of metastasis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed no evidence of dissemination. He underwent complete surgical resection as confirmed by postoperative imaging. Histopathological analysis including reticulin staining revealed a desmoplastic/nodular MB (confirmed by a central review by T.P.) as shown in Figure . Diffuse severe cytological anaplasia was not present. Complementary immunophenotypic characterization as described (, ) suggested a MB with SHH activation, TP53 wild-type (Figure ). Of note, nuclear INI-1 staining was preserved (Figure ) while P53 immunostaining showed nuclear positivity only in a small proportion of the tumor cells (data not shown). There was no evidence of MYCN or MYCC amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). Next generation sequencing (NGS) over a panel of 50 genes (Ion AmpliSeq\u2122 Cancer Hotspot Panel v2) revealed IDH1 R132C mutation in 46% of cells. NGS was repeated over a panel of 400 genes (Ion AmpliSeq\u2122 Comprehensive Cancer Panel)1 and it revealed IDH1 R132C mutation in 24% of cells as well as SMARCB1-R201G in 30% of cells and CDH11-L625T in 26% of cells (Table A1). The panel was tested on both tumor and normal tissue to confirm the somatic nature of the mutations. Of note, mutations in SMO, PTCH1, SUFU and TP53 were not detected. Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850k) array revealed highest resemblance to the methylation class MB, subclass SHH A (children and adult). However, the calibrated score was 0.44 so that a clear subgroup assignment could not be done (). Calculation of a low density copy number profile from the array data indicated a flat genome without relevant chromosomal aberration (Figure ). Deletions of chromosome 9q (PTCH1) were absent. Assessment of overall CpG methylation and CpG island methylation levels of the tumor showed relative CpG hypermethylation compared to other reference classes of MB () (Figure ).

{"clinical_note": "A 20 years old woman was referred to Gazi University Department of Prosthodontics with a chief complaint of tooth discoloration, diastema, unsatisfactory esthetics and slight tooth sensitivity. The medical and dental history revealed that the patient\u2019s family was not affected by AI. A renal ultrasound scan was normal, and it showed no evidence of nephrocalcinosis. Laboratory findings, including serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, urea, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase and parathormone levels were all normal. Clinical examination of the patient showed the insufficient enamel thickness, and the patient\u2019s anterior and posterior teeth were discolored (Fig. ). The panoramic radiography also showed that the thin enamel layer could not be distinguished from the underlying dentin (Fig. ). There were no anterior open bite and missing teeth. However, short crowns, multiple diastema, occlusal wear with exposed dentin in the posterior areas, poor contact points and dental caries are the additional clinical findings (Figs. and ). The roots showed normal length and form. The pulp chambers were regular in size. Her oral hygiene was acceptable with no signs of gingivitis (Fig. ).\nThe maxillary and mandibular left third molar teeth were extracted to perform SEM and histologic analyzes. These teeth were totally covered by mucosa (Fig. ). Therefore, they were selected for SEM and histologic analyzes by the purpose of examining the tooth structure of the patient which had not been exposed to the oral environment. SEM and histologic analyzes were performed on the extracted mandibular and maxillary third molar teeth (Figs. and ). One of the third molar teeth was fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde. The tooth was then cut longitudinally, and the sections were coated with gold (Sputter Coater SC7620, Polaron, VG Microtech, England). The analysis was done via SEM (JEOL, JSM-6060LV, Tokyo, Japan). SEM analysis showed that there was an insufficient enamel layer (Fig. ). Additionally, the other third molar tooth was demineralized with 10% formaldehyde for 3 weeks. The tooth was then cut longitudinally, and it was stained with hematoxylin-eosin stain. Histological findings revealed that dentin structure was intact and there was no irregularity in tubular structure. These findings confirmed that there was no defect related to dentin (Fig. ).\nDiagnostic casts were attached on a semi-adjustable articulator (Stratos 200; Ivoclar Vivadent Ag, Pforzeim, Germany) in centric occlusion. The occlusal vertical dimension was determined by the Niswonger method [] and verified with the closest speaking space method. The interocclusal distance at the physiologic rest position was 6 mm. In order to ensure proper vertical dimension and to create enough space for a restorative reconstruction, the bite was opened 5 mm in the anterior region. Furthermore, to predict the last appearance of the restoration, diagnostic wax-up was prepared at the determined vertical dimension (Fig. ), and expected treatment outcome was performed with the digital smile design software (Romexis 4.5, Planmeca USA, Inc).\nUnder local anesthesia, all teeth were prepared with chamfer margins. The crown length of maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth was insufficient for crown retention. In addition, there was an asymmetry of the gingival contours in the anterior maxillary teeth (Fig. ). After periodontal evaluation, because of insufficient crown length, ostectomy procedure was performed for maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth. In addition, gingivectomy was applied for maxillary anterior teeth. All periodontal surgery procedures were performed by the periodontologist. The impressions for provisional casts were made with a condensation silicone impression material (Zetaflow; Zhermack, Italy). Then, an interocclusal record was prepared with a hard addition-type A-silicon material (Imprint\u2122 Bite, 3M ESPE) at the increased vertical dimension (5 mm in anterior region) which was determined in diagnostic wax-up stage. The autopolymerizing acrylic resin (ALIKETM; GC America, Alsip, IL, USA) provisional crowns were fabricated at the determined vertical dimension extraorally by an indirect method, then they were cemented with temporary cement (Temp Bond NETM; Kerr) (Fig. ). These restorations were assessed in terms of esthetic and phonetics. 1, 2 and 3 month regular checkups were performed. The speech, swallowing, anterior and posterior speaking space, muscle sensitivity, mastication, TMJ discomfort, were assessed during this period. The patient was asymptomatic. The criteria of the success for increased vertical dimension were the absence of pain, no sensitivity in facial and masticatory muscles, phonetic and swallowing satisfaction. At the end of the 3 months follow up period, definitive impressions were made with a condensation silicone impression material (Zetaflow; Zhermack, Italy). Occlusal registration was obtained with a hard addition-type A-silicon material (Imprint\u2122 Bite, 3M ESPE) with a slightly reduced vertical dimension from the provisional restoration. After that, the working casts were obtained and mounted on the semi-adjustable articulator (Stratos 200) using a face-bow transfer (Facebow UTS-3D, Ivoclar Vivadent) (Fig. ).\nThe patient was rehabilitated with metal alloy (M\u0131crolit Is\u0131, Sch\u00fctz Dental Group) - ceramic (Cerabien ZR Noritake) fixed partial dentures in the posterior regions. In order to achieve better esthetic appearance and to camouflage the AI affected tooth color, zirconia ceramic (Katana, Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc) based crowns were used in the anterior regions of low and upper jaws (Fig. ). With this prosthodontic rehabilitation, maximum interdigitation and a canine guidance could be achieved. Metal-ceramic fixed partial dentures were cemented with zinc polycarboxylate cement (Adhesor\u00ae Carbofine; Kerr) and zirconia ceramic crowns cemented with self-etch dual cured resin cement (Maxcem Elite, MXE; Kerr). Following cementation, a maxillary protective occlusal splint was manufactured to protect the restorations from chipping or fracture due to the bruxism.

{"clinical_note": "A 46-year-old gentleman, morbidly obese (BMI 57.4 kg/m2), was referred to our institute 20 days after a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, complicated by gastric leak. On presentation, he was septic and in distress, tachycardic, and tachypneic. He was febrile and complaining of abdominal pain. Examination revealed a distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness and left basilar crackles on lung examination. Initial laboratory tests revealed elevated WBC and CRP. Upper GI series and CT scan of the abdomen showed evidence of contained gastric fistula with perigastric fluid collection (Figs. and ).\nThe patient was kept NPO, started on parenteral nutrition, intravenous antibiotics and was well-hydrated to control the sepsis. He underwent CT-guided drainage of the collection. One week post-drainage, upper GI series was repeated showed a well-drained gastric leak.\nAfter 10 days of stabilization, the patient showed marked improvement, became afebrile, and his WBC and CRP normalized, so a decision to undergo a Baltazar procedure was taken (Fig. ).\nAfter insufflation of the abdomen and insertion of trocars, lysis of loose adhesions was successfully done, in aim to uncover the gastric tube, which was covered with omental adhesions. The perigastric cavity was opened and well-irrigated, and with careful dissection, we unexpectedly identified two leak sites along the staple line, the first one was located 4 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and the second one was located 6 cm away from the first fistula site. Unfortunately, stenting was not available at our institution.\nAfter careful assessment, intra-op decision was made to attempt a new surgical technique: double Baltazar procedure. Two fistulo-jejunostomies were done with the same jejunal limb. The first fistulo-jejunostomy was done at the cephalic gastric fistula site with handsewn double-running 2/0 PDS suture. More distally to the created fistulo-jejunostomy, along the same jejunal loop, the second fistulo-jejunostomy was done using the same technique. Methylene blue test was done and showed no residual leak. Jejuno-jejunostomy (Brown anastomosis) was done after that to divert the biliary secretions and to protect the anastomotic sites.

{"clinical_note": "This is a 50-year-old right-handed male, with 33-year history of T6 AIS A SCI from a gunshot wound complicated by chronic pain, left hip and knee heterotophic ossification, and a chronic dislocation of his right hip, who initially presented to the emergency room with a right shoulder mass in September 2014. While he initially noticed the mass about 2 months earlier, he presented for evaluation now because of acute onset of pain, weakness and paresthesias in the right arm. He was admitted to the general medicine service for pain management and underwent an initial work up for his right shoulder mass, including advanced imaging and a core biopsy. Physiatry was consulted due to his functional deterioration that precluded him from returning to his previous independent living arrangement. He demonstrated diffuse, mild weakness throughout the right arm that was variable and seemed to be correlated with his reported pain level, but his most consistent and weakest movement patterns were his grade 4/5 weakness in finger abduction and distal interphalangeal joint flexion. He had reduced pin prick sensation over the volar surface of digits 3\u20135, palm and forearm of the right arm and hand. He was not able to perform transfers to or from his manual wheelchair due to his level of pain. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with a maximum diameter of 6.9 cm (Fig. ) that involved the right deltoid and pectoralis major muscles. His core biopsy demonstrated a STS that was classified as a high grade (III) spindle cell sarcoma.\nOncology recommended treatment for his STS with a course of outpatient neo-adjuvant radiation therapy followed by gross total resection with wide margins. Physiatry pre-operative consult focused heavily on functional prognostication. The patient expressed multiple times that he placed the highest priority on return to his previous modified independent living arrangement and not only survival after his STS treatment course. The patient\u2019s personal values combined with the physiatric assessment informed the pre-surgical planning. In particular a decision was made to take a narrower surgical margin around key muscle group (pectoralis major and deltoids) in order to help maintain the man\u2019s manual wheelchair mobility and his ability to independently transfer himself.\nHe completed neo-adjuvant radiation therapy in November of 2014 and underwent radical excision of his right shoulder mass with flap closure that December. He began intensive inpatient rehabilitation after he was given clearance to weight bear through his arm about 8 weeks later. Initially he required total assistance for most ADL\u2019s, including transfers, manual wheelchair propulsion, dressing and toileting. Despite the extensive surgery and radiation treatments, the gentleman was able to return to a functional level, approaching his pre-morbid status (modified independence).

On initial assessment by paramedics he showed no signs of life and was in asystole. He was resuscitated until spontaneous circulation was restored at 36 min. Investigations revealed low ionised calcium (0.72 mmol/L), warranting repeated intravenous calcium boluses followed by continuous infusion. Cefotaxime was commenced for presumed sepsis, and oseltamivir was added after isolating influenza A on a nasal swab. Intravenous fluids and inotropes were administered. In the intensive care unit, an echocardiogram showed severe dilated cardiomyopathy with poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25\u201330% [normal 55\u201370%]), fractional shortening (FS) of 7% [normal 29\u201340%], dyskinetic septal motion, global hypokinesia, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with a structurally normal heart. Rickets was confirmed radiographically (Fig. ), with elevated serum ALP and PTH concentrations, and low 25OHD < 15 nmol/L (Table ). Cholecalciferol (6000 IU daily) was commenced, and intravenous calcium was continued until serum calcium normalised (72 h). Cardiac failure was managed with diuretics and vasodilators. Brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, correlating with the clinical finding of unresponsiveness to external stimuli. The care team and family elected to withdraw life support, and the infant died 6 days after presentation.\nPost-mortem examination confirmed severe nutritional rickets with rachitic rosary (enlarged rib growth plates) (Fig. ), craniotabes, soft ribs, dilated cardiomyopathy (heart weight 71 g [>95th centile], with multifocal myocardial necrosis) and massive ischaemic brain injury. Histological analysis of a 7th rib growth plate showed extreme disarray, widening and lengthening, with islands of hypertrophic chondrocytes reaching far into the primary spongiosa and mature bone, typical of rickets (Fig. ). Histomorphometric analysis of a transiliac bone sample identified severe osteomalacia with increased osteoid thickness (23.2 \u03bcm [normal 6.4 +/\u2212 1.4]), osteoid surface/bone surface (76.3% [normal 24.9 +/\u2212 10]) and osteoid volume/bone volume (40.5% [normal 2.4 +/\u2212 1.22]). Specifically, osteoid thickness was + 262% and osteoid volume/bone volume + 1573% of normal reference values [9]. Since Goldner\u2019s Trichrome staining does not discriminate well between non-mineralized and poorly mineralized matrix, we also performed quantitative backscattered electron imaging, which confirmed the extremely low bone mineralization density (Fig. ).\nThe mother had received antenatal multivitamin supplementation and attended all post-natal child surveillance and vaccination appointments.

After performing CT imaging for the treatment planning, breath-hold training was given to each patient for optimizing the breath-hold and the following free breathing periods so that each segmented breath-hold VMAT delivery could be successfully completed.\nIn order to deliver segmented VMAT beams while the implanted marker stays at the planned breath-hold position, a DRR image at the gantry start angle was created in the Monaco TPS and transferred to the XVI. Subsequently, two lateral lines were drawn 2.5 mm above and below the center of the planned breath-hold marker position on the DRR image. Those lines were manually copied onto a fluoroscopic image window of the XVI display using a transparent sheet, each line being used as a tolerance limit for the breath-hold beam delivery.\nPrior to the beam delivery, CBCT imaging under free-breathing condition was performed to adjust the position of the patient couch by matching bone anatomy between the planning CT and the CBCT images. Subsequently, the patient was asked to breathe in slowly under fluoroscopy. Immediately after the marker position on the fluoroscopic image moved inside the tolerance range, the patient was asked to hold the breath and the VMAT beam was delivered. During the beam delivery, the breath-hold status was continuously monitored by checking if the deviation of the marker position exceeded the tolerance limit. As long as the marker stayed within the tolerance range, a segmented VMAT delivery continued for a preset period of 15 to 30 seconds depending on the breath-hold capability of each patient. As soon as each segmented delivery was completed, the beam interrupt button was pushed; and then, the patient was asked for free breathing. This procedure was repeated until all the segmented VMAT beams were delivered. Even when an intermediate beam interrupt due to a breath-hold failure during each segmented beam delivery was observed, the remaining beam delivery can be safely performed by referring to the two lateral tolerance lines for reproducing the breath-hold status for any gantry angles. It was decided that patients unable to hold the breath at least for15 seconds were considered not applicable. The patient who could hold the breath for 20 seconds was selected for this study after written informed consent was obtained. In order to confirm that the marker position relative to the tumor remained unchanged, multiple breath-hold CBCT imaging was also performed with the marker being inside the tolerance limit, thereby allowing comparison of the marker positions between planning CT and the breath-hold CBCT images.\nVideo shows a fluoroscopic movie showing the movement of the coil marker during the first coplanar segmented VMAT delivery (gantry rotation from 320\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 ) on the patient in reference to the two lateral lines (green color) giving a tolerance limit of 2.5 mm above and below the projected center of the marker. As long as the marker center stayed within the tolerance range, the segmented VMAT delivery continued for a preset period of about 25 seconds depending on the breath-hold capability of the patient. Unexpected intermediate beam interrupts due to a breath-hold failure during the segmented VMAT delivery can be well managed because the remaining beam delivery can be restarted at any gantry angle once the marker comes back within the tolerance range. In this lung tumor case, the total VMAT delivery time for a prescribed fraction dose of 3 Gy was approximately 115 sec with three beam interrupts and a 25 sec segmented beam delivery followed by 20 sec free breathing.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 19-year-old female was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of pain and swelling on the lateral side of the ankle after sustaining an ankle sprain. The patient was unable to bear weight upon admission. On physical examination, there was prompt swelling over the lateral side of the ankle and the tip of the fibula was tender on palpation. The ankle's range of motion was limited. The neurovascular examination was normal and the direct radiographic examination revealed a displaced distal fibular fracture (Weber type A) (Figure ). As the fracture was intra-articular and there was considerable displacement (>4 mm), fixation of the fracture was mandatory.\nUnder spinal anesthesia and tourniquet control, a small longitudinal incision was made over the distal fibula. The fracture was reduced and fixed with a single, 3.2 mm, intramedullary, magnesium headless compression screw (MAGNEZIX CS, Syntellix AG, Hannover, Germany) in a retrograde manner from the tip of the fibula. A short-leg plaster cast was applied to the patient for four weeks. After the removal of the cast, full weight-bearing was encouraged and ankle joint exercises were started. During the follow-up, fracture union was achieved without any complications within eight weeks (Figure ).\nAt the final follow-up examination, two years after the operation, the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score was 100 points and the patient had returned to the pre-injury level of activity. During the serial radiographic follow-up, a radiolucent zone was seen around the screw, but on the final follow-up radiograph, this radiolucency had almost completely disappeared (Figure ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "The patient is a 16-year-old male without a significant past medical history who was transferred to our institution after a gunshot injury to the right lower extremity. On physical examination, two bullet entry points were evident at the right popliteal fossa and dorsal soft tissues of the distal right leg. Initial radiographs were negative for fractures or dislocation.\nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a retained bullet fragment within the popliteal fossa abutting the dorsal aspect of the popliteal artery. An 8 millimeter (mm) soft tissue density abutting the medial aspect of the popliteal artery was also identified, concerning for either a small pseudoaneurysm or short segment intramural hematoma. Streak artifact from the retained bullet precluded adequate assessment of this region. The peroneal artery demonstrated a 10 centimeter (cm) occlusion 2.5 cm distal to its origin but reconstituted distally at the level of the mid-tibia. The anterior and posterior tibial arteries were both normal in appearance and patent. The dorsalis pedis artery was unremarkable. There was subcutaneous emphysema throughout the deep and superficial posterior compartment of the knee and throughout the medial aspect of the leg.\nThe patient was taken to the interventional radiology suite and a right lower extremity diagnostic runoff angiogram was performed. Initial images obtained with the patient\u2019s leg held in extension demonstrated abrupt cutoff of the popliteal artery immediately adjacent to the bullet fragment (Figure ). We then proceeded to reposition the patient\u2019s right leg in the \u201cfrog-leg position\u201d. A second diagnostic runoff angiogram was then performed demonstrating mild short segment narrowing of the popliteal artery immediately adjacent to the bullet fragment but with reconstitution of flow down to the level of the tibial-peroneal trunk (Figure ). The anterior and posterior tibial arteries demonstrated patency on both the extension and frog-leg positions. It was concluded that leg straightening/extension was contributing to extrinsic compression and subsequent dynamic occlusion of the popliteal artery secondary to the bullets close proximity to the vessel.\nThe patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for exploration and removal of the bullet fragment. An intraoperative angiogram was negative for popliteal artery vascular injury, and the anterior and posterior tibial arteries were both patent without evidence of injury or flow-limiting stenosis.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

He had been well until 3 weeks prior to presentation, when he developed a febrile erythematous rash. Fever recurred a week before admission, associated with lethargy, vomiting, and non-bloody diarrhea. Family history is negative for kidney or hematological disorders; the non-consanguineous parents and the boy\u2019s three siblings are healthy.\nThe patient appeared pale, with bruises on abdomen, back, and lower extremities. The clinical exam was otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory work-up revealed hemolytic anemia with marked reticulocytosis, presence of schistocytes, profound thrombocytopenia, elevated uric acid, and normal serum creatinine concentrations. Plasma haptoglobin was undetectable, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevated, and direct Coombs test negative. A stool sample was negative for E. coli O157:H7. Anti-streptolysin titers were only marginally elevated. D-dimers were increased to 2.49 \u03bcg/mL fibrinogen-equivalent units (N 0.02\u20130.47 \u03bcg/mL). Prothrombin, international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, and C3 and C4 concentrations were normal, and sC5b-9 was increased to 653 ng/mL (normal < 300 ng/mL; SC5b-9 Plus MicroVue, ELISA, TECOmedical/Quidel, San Diego, CA). Urinalysis revealed microscopic erythrocyturia and mild proteinuria. On Day 2, the patient received transfusions of red blood cells and platelets. Hemoglobin (Hb) continued to fall to 48 g/L, and platelets dropped to 5 \u00d7 109/L within 2 days of the transfusions (Table ).\nA tentative diagnosis of aHUS was made, and a single dose of eculizumab (~ 900 mg/m2) was given 2 days after admission. The patient was vaccinated against N. meningitidis and started amoxicillin prophylaxis. Platelet count, Hb, and LDH started to improve after 4 days and normalized within 17 days. The diagnosis was corrected to TTP several days after discharge from hospital, when the ADAMTS13 activity in the pre-treatment plasma sample was found to be unmeasurably low using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRETS-VWF73 substrate) assay (Peptide International Inc. Louisville KY) []. The patient also had anti-ADAMTS13 IgG antibodies (1:64) (in-house titration ELISA with recombinant ADAMTS-13 (Baxter, Mississauga, Canada) as target antigen and serial plasma dilutions). Incubating patient and reference plasma (ADAMTS13 activity 0 and 100%, respectively) in equal volumes at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min reduced the ADAMTS13 activity in the mixture to 0%, indicating the presence of an inhibitor in an assay analogous to the Bethesda assay using the FRETS-VWF73 substrate. Due to rapid clinical and laboratory improvement following treatment with eculizumab, we refrained from PLEX and immunosuppressive therapy. ADAMTS13 activity normalized completely after 15 months (Fig. and Table ).\nThe initial mutation screen for ADAMTS13 and genes encoding complement factors CFH, CFI, and CFB, CD46/membrane cofactor protein (MCP), factor H-related protein (CFHR) 5, C3, apelin and thrombomodulin was negative. CFH protein concentration was normal. Comprehensive re-testing confirmed the previous results and excluded mutations of diacylglycerol kinase-epsilon (DGKE), plasminogen (PLG) and methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cblC complementation type (MMACHC), but identified a homozygous deletion of CFHR3/1. No anti-CFH antibodies were demonstrated during active disease and follow-up, and there was no documented relapse of TTP or TMA over the 4 years of observation. A moderate, temporary increase of plasmatic sC5b-9 was noted > 2\u00bd years after presentation in the absence of clinical symptoms or hematological evidence of TMA.

The revised international prognostic scoring system was 0, and no specific treatment was undertaken. Other significant past medical history included well-controlled hypertension treated with quinapril and type 2 diabetes mellitus without medication.\nIn November 2016, he experienced severe asthenia and excessive sweating. Laboratory tests revealed leukocyte count of 8,000 per cubic millimeter with hyperblastosis (23%), anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The results of the bone marrow aspiration confirmed AML (M4 type) according to the French\u2013American\u2013British classification, without extramedullary manifestations. FLT3, CEBP\u03b1, and NPM1 were not mutated and no cytogenetic abnormalities were found. This AML was secondary to a myelodysplastic syndrome with single lineage dysplasia. For these reasons, the patient was eligible for a hematopoietic stem cell allograft.\nIn the Hematology department, an asymptomatic hypoglycemia that persists despite glucose infusion was found. Laboratory tests showed type B LA with an elevated blood lactate of 14 mmol/L (normal range, 0.5\u20132 mmol/L) associated with a slightly decreased pH of 7.35 (normal range, 7.38\u20137.42). Serum bicarbonate was low at 13 mmol/L (normal range, 24\u201332 mmol/L) with normal renal function tests and an elevated anion gap of 28 mmol/L. Liver function tests were normal.\nThe patient was transferred to the Intensive Care unit. His temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, his blood pressure was normal at 149/82 mmHg, his pulse was 119 bpm, and the respiratory rate was 28 per minute without respiratory distress which indicated Kussmaul breathing. The patient did not present any signs of hypoperfusion (he had normal blood pressure, absence of mottling, normal capillary refilling test). The palpation of the abdomen was normal without diarrhea. In the absence of a type A LA etiology, and in the context of AML, we suspected WE. Chemotherapy by doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cytarabine 100 mg/m2 was initiated at day 1. A slight tumor lysis syndrome was observed without kidney injury. We noted no recurrence of hypoglycemia, a rapid normalization of pH, and a decrease in the blood lactate level: 12.1 mmol/L at day 2, 9.2 mmol/L at day 3, 2.6 mmol/L at day 5, and 1.6 mmol/L at day 7 (Figure ). We observed no further complications, allowing ICU discharge at day 8.\nUnfortunately, a relapse of AL occurred at day 43. This relapse was associated with a new hyperlactatemia (pH: 7.37 and blood lactate level: 12.8 mmol/L) and asymptomatic hypoglycemia related to a recurrence of WE (Figure ). Salvage chemotherapy with cytarabine 1,500 mg/m2 and gemtuzumab 3 mg/m2 was initiated, resulting in the disappearance of WE. However, the patient later developed septic shock as a complication of chemotherapy-induced aplasia and digestive infection. We suspected infectious colitis because of diarrhea and abdominal guarding. Unfortunately, the CT scan was not contributory and we could not perform a colonoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with imipenem, vancomycin, and gentamycin was administered.

{"clinical_note": "A 52-year-old Japanese man with lower abdominal pain underwent lower endoscopy, revealing a type 2 lesion with the entire circumference raised in the rectosigmoid colon. He was diagnosed with rectosigmoid colon cancer and underwent endoscopic stent placement as a bridge to surgery for large bowel obstruction. He was found to have multiple lung metastases and a horseshoe kidney on CT scan (Fig. ). 3D-CT angiography showed an aberrant renal artery at the isthmus from 3 cm under the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) branch of the aorta (Fig. ). Laparoscopic anterior rectal resection was performed with a five-port conventional technique in which sigmoid colon and upper rectum were mobilized via a medial approach. During the operation, the IMA, left ureter, left gonadal vessels, and hypogastric nerve plexus were identified and preserved (Fig. , ). The root of aberrant renal artery was not visualized. The root of the IMA was located considerably cephalad to the renal isthmus, and the left branch of aberrant renal artery that was close to IMA was detected and preserved (Fig. ). The specimen was removed through a small laparotomy wound, and intraperitoneal reconstruction was performed according to the standard double stapling technique. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day 16. Pathological examination demonstrated no metastasis of the lymph node.\nHorseshoe kidney is rare, with an incidence of 0.25%, and the incidence is higher in males than in females at a ratio of 2:1. Horseshoe kidneys are fused at the lower pole in 95% of cases, and the isthmus is composed of fibrous tissue alone or contains parenchyma. The horseshoe kidney is located at a level lower than the normal kidneys because elevation of the kidneys interferes with the isthmus at the origin of the IMA.\nA literature search revealed 23 patients who underwent surgery for colon cancer with concomitant horseshoe kidney including our patient, from 1983 to 2017 [\u2013]. There were 14 men and 9 women, and the affected region was the sigmoid colon in 12, rectum in 8, descending colon in 2, and ascending colon in 1. Surgery was performed under laparoscopy in 20 patients. The positions of the anatomical structures necessary for surgery are summarized in Table .\nRegarding the ureteral distribution, it was present on the ventral side of the horseshoe kidney, i.e., almost the same as that in patients with normal kidneys, in all cases in which the distribution was described. The ureters were present on the ventral side of the horseshoe kidney in many reported cases, suggesting that it was conserved on dissection similarly in patients with normal kidneys. However, there were some cases where the ureters were present on the dorsal side of the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney, where a ureter other than the bilateral ureters independently came out from the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney, where two ureters each came out from the bilateral sides, or where the ureters ectopically opened in regions other than the urinary bladder [], suggesting the necessity of preoperative imaging diagnosis and careful surgery.\nIn the cases described in the literature, the distribution of the gonadal artery and vein were usually normal. However, variations have been reported, such as the presence of two left ovarian veins and branching of the testicular artery from the renal artery and renal sinus [], again suggesting the necessity of preoperative imaging diagnosis and careful surgery.\nThe bilateral lumbar splanchnic and superior hypogastric nerves were distributed on the ventral side of the horseshoe kidney in six patients reported, including in our patient, but superior hypogastric nerves distributed from the dorsal side of the horseshoe kidney into the pelvis were noted in one patient. Although there were only a few reports on the distribution of the bilateral splanchnic and superior hypogastric nerves in patients with horseshoe kidney, the second lumbar splanchnic nerves were present on the ventral side of the kidneys and the third lumbar splanchnic nerves were present on the dorsal side of the kidneys, and both nerves formed superior hypogastric plexuses in a report of an autopsied patient [].\nArterial anomalies are reported in more than 70% of patients with horseshoe kidney, due to remain of branches from the common iliac artery, median sacral artery, and IMA. Excess renal arteries were observed in 16 of 23 patients, including patients with unclear details. K\u00f6lln classified the vascular supply in the horseshoe kidney into the following three types: (1) direct single branching from the aorta on the bilateral sides (15%), (2) several blood vessels on the bilateral sides and in the isthmus all directly branching from the aorta (65%), and (3) several blood vessels on the bilateral sides and in the isthmus that branch from common iliac artery, internal iliac artery, inferior mesenteric artery, or median sacral artery (20%) []. The second pattern was noted in our patient. 3D-CT angiography is useful in these cases [, ]. As the resolution of CT increased, the positional relationship among the IMA, kidneys, and excess renal arteries may be sufficiently identified using 3D-CT angiography.\nIn our patient, the IMA was easily detected during usual mobilization via median approach. We usually dissected the layers preserving the plexus, and the left branch of aberrant renal artery that was close to IMA was detected and preserved uneventfully, because the locations of the excess renal arteries and IMA were sufficiently identified using 3D-CT angiography. Injury to excess renal arteries by laparoscopic colectomy may be avoided by retaining accurate dissection layers, because they are present in the retroperitoneum. Even when an accurate dissection layer cannot be retained, laparoscopic colectomy may be safely performed by sufficiently evaluating images and confirming the anatomical structures before surgery.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

On physical examination, the abdomen was flat and soft with tenderness in the epigastric region, but no sign of peritoneal irritation. Blood biochemistry findings revealed elevated values: creatinine, 1.16 mg/dl; lactate dehydrogenase, 364 U/l; and creatine phosphokinase, 622 U/l.\nAbdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed twisted mesentery with the small intestine around the point of torsion (whirl sign) and the superior mesenteric artery as the axis. Contrast enhancement was weakened in the same area of the small bowel (Fig. ). Given this information, we suspected small bowel volvulus and performed emergency surgery on the same day.\nA 5-mm camera port was placed in the umbilicus and 5-mm ports in the lower and right lower abdomen. During laparoscopic examination, the upper jejunum adhered to the small bowel close to the terminal ileum with overlapping of the small bowel. The entire part from the upper jejunum to the terminal ileum was twisted clockwise with the superior mesenteric artery and vein as the axes and the adhesion site as the starting point. There were areas of poor color enhancement throughout the twisted section of the small bowel (Fig. ). We laparoscopically separated the adhesion between different sections of the intestinal tract and traced the bowel from the small bowel in the region of the ligament of Treitz toward the anus to confirm the absence of adhesions or torsion up to the terminal ileum.

{"clinical_note": "A 70-year-old man underwent an endoscopic examination owing to epigastric pain and was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. The endoscopic examination revealed an irregular mucosa in the lower esophagus, and biopsies confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT did not depict the esophageal lesion but showed enlarged lymph nodes in the tracheal bifurcation and bilateral hilum of the lung. FDG-PET/CT revealed abnormal accumulation in the main tumor in the lower esophagus (maximum standardized uptake value [SUV max]: 4.06) and higher accumulation in the hilar-mediastinal lymph nodes (SUV max: 15.0) and enlarged mediastinum lymph nodes (SUV max: 6.94) (Fig. ). The primary lesion of the esophagus was staged T1; nevertheless, it was still difficult to rule out metastasis in the lymph nodes. We selected chemotherapy as the first-line treatment. The patient was administered 2 cycles of 140 mg cisplatin and 1400 mg 5-fluorouracil over 2 months. In each cycle, 9.9 mg dexamethasone was administered to prevent side effects of chemotherapy. Subsequently, we observed a disappearance of the FDG uptake in the primary lesion, and a slightly reduced FDG uptake in the mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes (Fig. ). These non-identical responses to chemotherapy did not indicate cancer metastasis, but most likely a sarcoid-like reaction of the lymph nodes associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Therefore, the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery esophagectomy (VATSE) with gastric tube reconstruction via the retrosternal route. The pathological diagnosis was moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lower thoracic esophagus. The resected lymph nodes demonstrated no tumor metastasis. However, some lymph nodes (#8a, #106RecR, #107, #108, #109) showed granulomatous reactions, histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and scar-like fibrosis (Fig. ), suggesting the presence of sarcoidosis or sarcoid-like reactions. In accordance with the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM staging system (7th edition), the tumor was classified as pT1N0M0, pStage IA. The patient was discharged 49 days after surgery. FDG-PET/CT performed 15 months after surgery showed bilateral FDG accumulation in the hilar lymph nodes without tumor recurrence.", "topic_list": "['underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 72-year-old woman with a past medical history of sarcoidosis underwent an endoscopic examination owing to dysphagia. The endoscopic examination revealed a circumferential tumor with ulceration in the cervical esophagus. Biopsies obtained during the endoscopy indicated squamous cell carcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT showed extensive tumor growth with suspected tracheal invasion and enlarged lymph nodes extending from the cervical region to the upper mediastinum. FDG-PET/CT revealed abnormal FDG accumulation in the primary lesion (SUV max: 23.1) and lymph nodes (SUV max: 5.45) from the cervical to upper mediastinal region (Fig. ). However, it was difficult to determine whether the multiple lymphadenopathy was benign or metastatic because of her past medical history of sarcoidosis. Therefore, and also for the purpose of preserving the larynx, we initiated definitive chemoradiotherapy. The patient was administered 2 cycles of 45 mg cisplatin and 700 mg 5-fluorouracil with 60 Gy/30 fr radiation therapy over 2 months. In each cycle, 8 mg dexamethasone was administered to prevent side effects of chemotherapy. After completing the chemoradiotherapy, we observed complete disappearance of FDG uptake in the primary cancer in the esophagus, and only a slight reduction in FDG uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes (SUV max: 3.26; Fig. ), which indicated that the lymph nodes were affected by sarcoidosis. The primary lesion of the esophagus relapsed 3 months later. Then, the patient underwent thoracoscopic and laparoscopic total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction via the posterior mediastinal route. The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the cervical esophagus. The resected lymph nodes demonstrated no tumor metastasis. However, some lymph nodes showed granulomatous reactions and contained several small epithelioid cell granulomas (Fig. ), suggesting the presence of sarcoidosis. The final stage was determined as pT2N0M0, pStage IB (UICC 7th). The patient was discharged 27 days after surgery. Contrast-enhanced CT performed 6 months after surgery showed no tumor recurrence.

She had a history of sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis 6 years prior and a past history of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. She had noted a reddish skin lesion around her anus over the past several years. She reported no change in bowel habits, no gastrointestinal symptoms, no weight loss, and no family history of malignancy.\nPhysical examination revealed an erythematous, inflamed skin lesion in the perianal region (Fig. ), but a normal vagina and rectum. Neither colposcopy, cystoscopy, nor colonoscopy showed evidence of a visible lesion or any abnormality of the cervix, bladder, or rectum (Fig. a, b). Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed no evidence of malignancy in the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tracts. Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens showed many Paget\u2019s cells within intraepithelial lesions of the perianal skin but no malignant cells in the rectal or vaginal mucosa. Therefore, primary extramammary Paget\u2019s disease (EMPD) of the anogenital region was suspected. We performed anal-preserving wide local excision deep to the subcutaneous fat with 1-cm negative margin from the positive sites confirmed by frozen section examination and mucosal resection of the anal canal that was extended 1 cm proximal to the dentate line of the anal canal. Reconstruction was performed using a bilobed gluteal fold flap (Fig. a, b).\nHistopathological examination of the resected specimen showed Paget\u2019s cells, characterized by clear cytoplasm and large pleomorphic nuclei, within the epidermis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the Paget\u2019s cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20, and caudal-related homeobox gene nuclear transcription factor (CDX) 2 and negative for gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP) 15 (Fig. a\u2013e). These data suggested that her perianal skin lesion was secondary EMPD arising from the rectum, although there was no lesion found in the rectum. Additional histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in an anal gland, continuous with the Paget\u2019s cells in the anoderm, but limited in the basement membrane without a desmoplastic change (Figs. a, b and a\u2013e). Immunohistochemical staining of the resected specimen revealed secondary EMPD due to adenocarcinoma arising from the anal gland.\nBecause of the possibility of residual adenocarcinoma in the anal gland, possibly extending to the sphincter, we performed a radical laparoscopy-assisted abdominoperineal resection. Any reconstructive plastic surgery was not needed. Histopathological examination revealed no residual cancer cells in the resected specimen and no lymph node metastasis.

{"clinical_note": "A 39-year-old Japanese man presented with a 3-month history of numbness on the left side of his face. His symptoms had gradually progressed and had become painful in the month before the initial visit. He also complained that sometimes he could not chew on the left side. An examination revealed decreased sensation over the distribution of the left trigeminal nerve that did not respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or muscle relaxants and was only slightly responsive to carbamazepine. His symptoms were associated with dyskinesia of the left masticatory muscles but there was no clicking sound. His facial expression was symmetrical at rest.\nHis past medical history was significant for acute gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and depression, for which brotizolam, flunitrazepam, and paroxetine had been prescribed, respectively. He was reticent and had difficulty communicating his feelings and wishes, which appeared to be related to his history of depression. Panoramic radiography revealed no specific findings relevant to his symptoms (Fig. ) but did identify slight restriction of movement of the temporomandibular joint on the left (Fig. ). MRI of the temporomandibular joint region was inconclusive for temporomandibular disorder and his symptoms were nonspecific for trigeminal neuralgia. Therefore, we extended the scanning range into the brain region and found a tumor measuring 10 mm in diameter and a homogeneously high signal intensity on axial T1-weighted images compared with gray matter (Fig. ) and low signal on axial T2-weighted images (Fig. ) in Meckel\u2019s cave. The tumor appeared to be exerting pressure on his trigeminal nerve. He was referred to the neurosurgery department where unenhanced computed tomography (CT) images demonstrated a localized well-defined mass lesion in Meckel\u2019s cave, which was homogeneously hyperdense compared with gray matter. No calcification was present (Fig. ).\nEn bloc excision was subsequently performed. Immunohistochemistry was positive for melanocytic features of Melan A (MART1; melanoma antigen recognized by T cells-1), human melanoma black-45, vimentin, and S-100 protein and negative for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and glia fibrillary acidic protein (Fig. ). Cellular proliferation was assessed by staining for Ki-67, which was positive, but the index was as low as 1\u20135%. These findings were associated with proliferation of tumor cells that contained abundant melanin pigment. Based on the above pathology results, a definitive diagnosis of melanocytoma was made.\nFollowing excision of the intracranial tumor, our patient underwent adjuvant gamma knife radiosurgery with 24 Gy in two fractions to the tumor bed in the epidural space of the middle cranial fossa.

Following disease relapse, a wedge resection of two nodules in hepatic segments VI and VII was performed in December 2008. Histological examination confirmed HCC grade III (Edmondson scoring), with necrosis and microscopic vascular thrombosis.\nIn September 2009, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed millimetric disease relapse in hepatic segments V, II, III, and I, and a 21 \u00d7 9 mm adenopathy at the hepatic hilum (Fig. a, b). A new resection was scheduled but was not carried out following the detection by intra-operative ultrasound (US) of a right portal branch neoplastic thrombosis. In December 2009, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was 1504 ng/mL. In January 2010, as a consequence of disease metastasis, systemic treatment with metronomic capecitabine (500 mg twice daily) was continuously administered according to a previously described protocol []. The therapy was well tolerated. After 1 month, serum AFP decreased to 643 ng/mL, and 3 months later, had drastically decreased to 7 ng/mL. At the same time, a marked reduction in liver lesion size was observed by MRI, evaluated as a partial response according to Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) []. In August 2010, computer tomography (CT) scanning showed a single hypodense lesion of 13 mm in hepatic segment II without any other liver lesions, and that enlarged abdominal lymph nodes were stable and neoplastic thrombosis was not detected. Given the presence of a single lesion, the possibility of residual disease ablation was explored using hepatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Two suspicious lesions for HCC were detected in hepatic segments II and III, without a typical contrastographic appearance. The lesions were submitted to needle biopsy, and histological analysis identified a nodule of low-grade dysplasia in segment II and micro and macronodular cirrhosis with light activity in segment III. The patient underwent metronomic capecitabine until July 2013 when, considering the sustained CR, treatment was discontinued and the patient entered a follow-up program.

Positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-(fluorine-18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG-PET) identified bone metastases in the proximal portion of the right femur, in the right ischial tuberosity, in the left acetabulum, in the left scapula, and in the third left costal arch. Moreover, a PET with (11)C-choline confirmed the hepatic and skeletal lesions and identified other metastases in the pelvic bones, rachis, and ribs. In October 2012, serum AFP was 1909 ng/mL. Considering the typical contrastographic pattern of the liver lesion by CT scanning and the elevated AFP level, a diagnosis of HCC was made according to European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines [].\nIn December 2012, the patient started systemic treatment with sorafenib 800 mg/bid. Ten days later, the treatment was discontinued because of G3 skin toxicity (Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome). In January 2013, the patient started metronomic capecitabine (500 mg twice daily, continuous administration), which was well-tolerated. In March 2013, a new CT scan showed a reduction in the number and size of the liver lesions with significant intralesional necrotic areas. Subsequent FDG-PET scanning (April 2013) showed the complete absence of pathological areas and, in parallel, AFP level had fallen to 3.3 ng/mL. In July 2013, a needle biopsy of the principal hepatic lesion evidenced fibrous connective tissue with histiocytic inflammation without tumour cells. An abdominal US scan (January 2014) revealed the presence of a single hypoechoic lesion of 1.4 \u00d7 1.3 cm. In December 2014, CT scanning showed a further size reduction of the hypodense hepatic lesion without vascular components, and it was therefore decided to discontinue treatment in the same month.

Laboratory workups and results of diagnostic procedures performed are summarized in Table . He underwent a successful KT 26 months ago with Scr at discharge 0.9 mg/dl with an immunosuppressive protocol consisting of prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus. Renal allograft function remained stable and urine analyses were always normal from discharge to 24 months after operation. Two months prior to this admission, he was hospitalized for fever and cough at another hospital. He was diagnosed with mild pulmonary infection and treated with azithromycin and ceftazidime. His pulmonary symptoms abated after a week antibiotic treatment while his serum Scr increased and proteinuria (3+) occurred. Furthermore, his blood platelet count also decreased to 34 \u00d7 109/L. Forty days prior to this admission, a renal allograft biopsy was performed. He was managed with intravenous antibiotics and immunosuppression enhancement by increasing the dosage of mycophenolate mofetil. His Scr level decreased initially with a nadir of 1.58 mg/dl, but elevated progressively with increased proteinuria (11.38 g/24 h). He denied family history of any kidney diseases or inheritable illnesses. A repeat kidney biopsy was performed in our hospital. Written informed consent to publish this case was obtained from this patient.\nLight microscopy showed multiple periodic acid-Sciff stain (PAS)-positive materials in the capillary lumens (Fig. ). Capillary wall duplication was obvious and diffuse (Fig. ). Masson trichrome stain revealed extensive fuchsinophilic deposits in the subepithelial, subendothelial and mesangial spaces (Fig. ). There were no peritubular capillaritis, endotheliatis, tubulitis nor glomerulitis, excluding the possibility of antibody and T-cell-mediated rejection. Histological signs of calcineurin-inhibitor toxicity, such as band-like fibrosis, isometric vacuolization of the tubules and hyaline deposits in the arterioles were not present.\nImmunofluorescence study indicated prominent C3 positivity (3+) along the basement membrane and in the mesangium (Fig. ) in all the 6 glomeruli examined, while IgA, IgG, IgM and C1q and C4d staining were all negative.\nElectron microscopy examination of 2 glomeruli showed widespread foot process effacement and electron-dense deposits in the subendothelial and subepithelial spaces (Fig. ). Furthermore, mesangial proliferation which protruded into capillary basement membrane caused the double contours observed in PAS staining. Subendothelial lucency, which is characteristic of TMA, was also present (Fig. ). No signs of chronic antibody-mediated rejection (ie. peritubular capillary multilayering), Based on these findings, a diagnosis of C3GN combined with TMA was rendered.\nRetrospective review of the 1st biopsy slides (X.F.) indicated similar light microscopy findings (Fig. ).

{"clinical_note": "We describe the case of a female infant. She was the second child born to a 33-year-old, gravida 3, para 2 mother. The patient was born polyhydramnios by cesarean section at 37 + 4 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 2440 g (\u2212 1.1 S.D.), a length of 50 cm (+ 0.80 S.D.) and an occipitofrontal circumference of 36 cm (+ 2.0 S.D.). The 1- and 5-min Apgar scores were 8 and 8, respectively. Shortly after birth, she required nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) and presented with dyspnea. During the following days, she developed dyspnea continually and needed oxygen to maintain 90\u201395% saturation. Parenteral nutrition was started on day 1 and breast milk was given 12 h after birth by oral tube. Her parents were nonconsanguineous and her mother had a healthy 13-year-old child. She denied any family history of neonatal disease. Prenatal examination was not found abnormal. Additionally, she denied that she had consumed alcohol, drugs, tobacco, or any other toxic substances during her pregnancy.\nOn admission to our unit, the patient was 3 days old and weighed 2400 g. Clinical examination showed choanal atresia, bilateral low-set ears, triple restriction and systolic murmur, but coloboma was not observed. Her motor development was almost normal. The patient presents feeding difficulties by nasogastric tube. Her white blood cell count was 12.07 \u00d7 109/L (neutrophils, 0.50; lymphocytes, 0.24), and her platelet count was 160.00 \u00d7 109/L and CRP < 1 mg/L. The alanine aminotransferase level was 14 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase level was 43 U/L, and gamma-glutamyltransferase level was 68 U/L. On the seventh day of age, her thyroid functional parameters were TSH 5 mIU/L, T3 1.83 nmol/L and T4 123.94 nmol/L, and at the first month of age, thyroid functional parameters were TSH > 100 mIU/L, T3 1.57 nmol/L and T4 35.93 nmol/L. Thus, oral Euthyrox (Levothyroxine sodium tablets) was administered. Newborn screening for metabolic disorders and severe combined immunodeficiency was normal. A chest radiograph showed haziness in both lung fields suggestive of wet lung (Fig. ). Two-dimensional and color-Doppler assessment was revealed an atrioventricular septal defect (6.8 mm + 2.2 mm), patent ductus arteriosus (3.6 mm) and pulmonary hypertension (Fig. ). A craniocerebral ultrasound showed bilateral lateral ventricle dilatation (Fig. ). The auditory brainstem response (ABR) test showed bilateral severe hearing impairment (ABR > 99 dBnHL). Following radiologic testing by computed tomography showed bilateral choanal atresia and insufficient inflatable structure of both semi-circular canals. (Fig. ). No clinical characteristics of CHARGE syndrome were detected in the patient\u2019s parents. Chromosomal analysis indicated a 46 XX normal female karyotype.\nThe patient required mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation at 4 days of age. On 17 days of age, she was extubated to nCPAP with FiO2 < 25%. On 20 days of age, she needed an oxygen mask. Ampicillin was discontinued when the blood culture from birth was sterile at 72 h. At the first month of age, the patient had a posterior nostril plasty operation by nasal endoscope and had a silicone tube in one month for transition the postoperative (Fig. ). At the second month of age, she had patent ductus arteriosus ligation surgery. At the 4th month of age, she was discharged from the hospital. Clinical features summarized in Table .\nMolecular analysis of the disease-associated genes CHD7 and EFTUD2 were performed using the Illumina TruSigt One sequencing panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) on the MiSeq NGS platform for mutation screening methods (Sinopath Diagnosis, Beijing, China) []. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral venous blood and informed consent was obtained from the parents. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Zhejiang University Children\u2019s Hospital. To identify presumably pathogenic single-nucleotide variants, we used NextGene V2.3.4 (Softgenetics, State College, PA, USA) compared with the UCSC database. We excluded sequence variants with a minor allele frequency > 0.05, in the Human Genetic Variation Database () and the NHLBI Grand Opportunity Exome Sequencing Project (ESP6500, ). This analyses identified a monoallelic (thymine) insertion in CHD7, NM_017780.3 (CHD7 c.4656dupT), which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. This mutation leads to a reading frameshift mutation starting from isoleucine, with the new reading frame ending p.(Ile1553fs) (Fig. ). As shown in Fig. , the mutation is located in exon 20, and this mutation was not present in the Human Gene Mutation Database (/) or ClinVar (),[] suggesting that it is novel.

The treatment was performed with Leksell Gamma Knife Icon\u00ae (Elekta Instruments, Stockholm, Sweden) and was planned as a hypofractionated irradiation including five daily fractions of 5 Gy. The restraint method chosen was the use of a thermoplastic mask Orfit\u00ae (Orfit Industries, Wijnegem, Belgium) [, ]. The mask was made 5 days before the first irradiation. During mask making, the mask was warmed by soaking in a water bath and then applied and molded directly on our patient\u2019s face for 20 minutes (Fig. ). At this step of the procedure, she complained of a burning and tingling sensation on her face, especially on her forehead. During the following 4 days, she continued to have a stable cutaneous reaction in the form of redness, tickling, and edematous swelling of her face. She was treated with a local antihistamine cream on her face, with moderate improvement in the symptoms. On the first day of treatment, during the first irradiation session, she complained again of a major sensation of burning and edema of the face. A clinical examination showed a serious allergic reaction on her face, associated with an atopic edema. She was treated with 125 mg of intravenously administered corticoids, followed by high doses of orally administered antihistamines and corticoids during the following 5 days. With this medication, the allergic reaction was controlled until the end of treatment 4 days later.

{"clinical_note": "A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.\nBiopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.\nThe patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina.

{"clinical_note": "A 29-year-old Asian man who had undergone surgical debridement at another hospital for a perianal abscess 5 days earlier was referred to the emergency room of Xiamen Chang Gung Hospital. The patient presented with continuous severe perianal and scrotal pain, scrotal swelling, and high fever (39.2 \u00b0C) of 3 days\u2019 duration that had been aggravated for 1 hour. The patient was mildly obese, described himself as otherwise quite healthy, and had never been admitted to a hospital previously. He reported no significant chronic medical history, such as primary hypertension, any type of heart disease, disturbed microcirculation, peripheral neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, an impaired immune system, malignancies, leukemia, long-term administration of corticosteroids, liver cirrhosis, renal failure, urinary tract infection, or hemodialysis. The patient also reported no history of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, any type of hepatitis, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The patient\u2019s medical history revealed no trauma, blood transfusion, other surgical procedures, or other serious event. He had not lived in an epidemic area and had no contact history of toxicity or radioactive exposure. The patient denied a family history of any inherited cancer. He did not smoke or consume alcohol and reported no other unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. The patient was a businessman by occupation and traveled for business most of the time.\nA general physical examination on admission revealed that the patient was hypotensive (blood pressure, 92/63 mmHg) and tachycardic (heart rate, 117 beats/minute). No positive signs were found during the neurological, cardiopulmonary, and abdominal examinations. Neither pain around the kidney area with percussion nor tenderness along the bilateral ureteral approach was found. No bulging, tenderness, or mass was evident in the bladder area. A genital examination revealed a normal distribution of pubic hair and normal penile development without deformity, prepuce, penile ulceration, tenderness, induration, or neoplasms. No ectopia or secretions were found at the urethral orifice. A perianal abscess and hemorrhoids were identified upon full perineal examination (a previous surgical wound with obviously inflammatory secretions was detected 2.0 cm from the anal edge and approximately 1.5 \u00d7 2.5 cm in size), and the patient\u2019s rectum was noted to be very tender. Furthermore, the scrotum was gangrenous with extensive cellulitis of the perineum and bilateral inguinal area and an increased skin temperature. No clear findings were obtained by palpation of the bilateral testis and epididymis.\nFollowing a rectal examination, the patient rapidly became sweaty and unwell, and his scrotum became blue, swollen, and tense, with erythema extending into both groins. Crepitations between the skin and fascia were palpable. The patient noted a concomitant deterioration in his urinary stream and a degree of hesitancy. His white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts were 23.1 \u00d7 109/L, 4.11 \u00d7 1012/L, and 112 \u00d7 109/L, respectively. Upon admission, his hemoglobin was 123 g/L, his ST-segment elevation was 84.0%, and his C-reactive protein level was 275.55 mg/L. The results of serology for both liver and renal function were normal. His coagulation and electrolyte profiles were normal. Computed tomography of the lower abdomen and pelvis (Additional files and ) revealed extensive emphysema around the testicles, epididymis, and perineal subcutaneous tissues. A diagnosis of FG complicating a perianal abscess was made.\nThe patient underwent aggressive fluid administration, hemodynamic support, and intravenous antibiotic therapy. He was treated with immediate surgical debridement under general anesthesia (Fig. ). Tissue cultures were obtained to isolate the responsible microorganisms. The necrotic skin in the scrotum and the perianal region was evacuated into an open drainage area using three incisions, leaving both testes exposed (Fig. ). There was no damage to the testicles, spermatic cords, or external sphincter.\nBlood and aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were performed. Microorganisms were not found in the blood cultures. Tissue samples taken during the first two debridements revealed that the microbiological etiology of FG was polymicrobial. Aerobic Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Escherichia coli as well as anaerobic peptostreptococci and Prevotella corporis were detected. Preoperative antibiotic treatment with combined broad-spectrum antibiotics (metronidazole 0.5 g every 8 hours and ceftriaxone 1 g every 12 hours for 6 days) was initiated and later adjusted to the culture sensitivity of the microbial isolates. The patient was therefore intravenously administered levofloxacin (0.3 g every 12 hours for 5 days).\nThe patient\u2019s white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level gradually decreased. On the third postoperative day, his white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts were 6.6 \u00d7 109/L, 4.54 \u00d7 1012/L, and 190 \u00d7 109/L, respectively. His hemoglobin was 135 g/L, his ST-segment elevation was 64.0%, and his C-reactive protein level was 100.24 mg/L. He had no fever thereafter.\nLocal wound care was administered using moist gauze dressing (i.e., normal saline) and was changed three times per day until healthy granulation tissue was observed. The patient underwent two subsequent surgical debridements. His infection gradually subsided, his gas gangrene resolved completely, and good granulation was present 1 week after surgery. Because both testicles were severely exposed, they were transpositioned into the scrotum on the eighth postoperative day. Split-skin closures (3-0 nylon suture) and open drainage from the scrotum and perianal area were subsequently performed (Fig. ). The patient was discharged on the 11th postoperative day (with antibiotics adjusted to oral administration of levofloxacin 0.1 g twice daily).\nThe patient attended the outpatient department four times for follow-up. The bilateral scrotal wounds healed, and the stiches were removed on the 18th postoperative day (the first follow-up). The viability of both testicles was confirmed using Doppler ultrasound on the 21st postoperative day (the second follow-up) and at 3 and 10 months after discharge (the third and fourth follow-up examinations). The open drainage area from the scrotum and perianal area had healed at 10 months after discharge. The patient was healthy as usual, with no complaints or illness.

However, she also complained of swelling of the right mandibular region. Since her symptoms had been worsening for 4 months, she was referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. At our hospital, facial conditions revealed right mandibular swelling and tenderness. Oral conditions showed no percussion and occlusal pain of teeth in the swelling region, and tooth mobility, gum swelling, and gum redness were not seen. Hence, there was no dental infection that could cause osteomyelitis/osteitis.

Nevertheless, she was admitted to our hospital with a complaint about heel pain and fever exceeding up to 40 degrees centigrade, after 9 days from the pin removal.\nOn the examination, skin redness, swelling, and pus-like discharge were observed around the surgical site (). Plain X-ray showed hyperpermeability of the calcaneus, and magnetic resonance images confirmed a diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the calcaneus as well as an abscess formation (). White blood cell count (WBC: 9.9 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl) and C-reactive protein (CRP: 10.06 mg/dl) were elevated.

His comorbidities included type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He had no family history of any malignancy. He was a life-long nonsmoker and his Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 1. He underwent left partial nephrectomy and histology revealed this to be a locally advanced clear cell RCC, Fuhrman grade 2, with involvement of 3 out of 20 lymph nodes (pT3A N1 M0). Postoperatively, he developed ESRD and was started on dialysis 3 times/week. Two years later, he developed a local recurrence in the left kidney and underwent left radical nephrectomy. Histopathology revealed a 5 cm, clear cell carcinoma, Fuhrman grade 2 with invasion of the perinephric fat and renal vessels. He remained on regular follow-up and unfortunately 2 years later he developed further disease progression with a renal bed recurrence along with multiple bone and lung metastases. He received high-dose palliative radiotherapy to the renal bed 40 Gray in 20 fractions followed by commencement of systemic treatment with dose-reduced pazopanib. The dose of pazopanib was reduced to 200 mg daily due to his poor ECOG performance status of 3 and ongoing renal dialysis. Unfortunately, follow-up CT scan 3 months later showed significant disease progression in the renal bed, bone, and lung metastases. He also developed significant pain (score 8 out of 10) over his left loin secondary to the renal bed metastatic deposit.\nHe was started on nivolumab 3 mg/kg initially and later switched to 240 mg flat dose intravenously every 2 weeks. He tolerated the treatment extremely well with no grade 2-4 toxicities. Clinically, there was a significant improvement in his pain control with a reduction in his pain score from 8/10 to 3/10 and his ECOG performance status improved to 2. Follow-up CT scans showed a partial response as per response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) version 1.1.

{"clinical_note": "At the 30th gestational week, a 41-year-old (gravida 2, para 1 [normal vaginal delivery]) woman with no remarkable medical/family histories was referred to us because of fetal cardiomegaly detected on routine prenatal ultrasound. Fetal ultrasound revealed the absence of ductus venosus (DV) with the UV directly draining into the right atrium (), consistent with the extrahepatic drainage type of ADV. The cardiothoracic area ratio was 36.5%, within the normal range of <40% () and heart valve regurgitation was absent. No cardiac structural abnormalities were detected, and cardiac functional parameters were normal. The parents did not desire fetal karyotyping, and, thus, amniocentesis was not performed. Direct UV flow into the systemic venous circulation (the right atrium) usually causes volume overload of the right heart, and thereby right heart failure, whose signs were carefully monitored, but they were not observed.\nAt 38+3 weeks, she showed the spontaneous onset of labor and vaginally gave birth to a 3,096-gram male infant (Apgar score 7/8 [1/5 min]). Neonatal cardiac ultrasound revealed mild aortic valve regurgitation and a slightly decreased ejection fraction, which were transient and disappeared on day 7. Detailed ultrasound examination revealed a defect of the hepatic rectangular leaf (S4: one of the largest liver leaves) at half a month postnatally. No findings indicative of liver dysfunction were observed throughout his course. Computed tomography at 1 year of age revealed atypical liver rotation with a Morgagni hernia in the liver ().

{"clinical_note": "A 4-year-old boy was transferred to our pediatric intensive care unit from an outside hospital for further management of a persistent seizure disorder of unknown etiology. A right femoral triple lumen central venous line (CVL) had been placed prior to transfer. Five days after arrival, the patient began to exhibit increased swelling in his right lower extremity, and ultrasonography revealed a catheter-related, acute occlusive deep venous thrombosis in the right common femoral vein. He was started on LMWH (enoxaparin) at 1 mg/kg for a planned course of 3 months. Five days after initiating treatment, the CVL was removed. The patient had no personal or family history of thrombophilia or bleeding diathesis. His anti-Xa level, checked after the second dose, was within the therapeutic range.\nHis hospital course was complicated by multisystem organ failure in the setting of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome secondary to anticonvulsive therapy. One week after starting LMWH heparin, the patient experienced gross hematuria. The next day, the injection sites were noted to be slightly oozy, and, in the setting of his anti-Xa levels continuing to rise (0.87), LMWH heparin was held. He required continuous venovenous hemofiltration, during which time anticoagulation was switched to unfractionated heparin. After renal recovery, LMWH therapy was restarted at a lower dose (70% of original dose), but his anti-Xa levels continued to be labile and difficult to control. Eventually, a steady regimen was found with consistently stable and therapeutic anti-Xa levels ().\nOn the 15th day of this regimen, however, he developed signs of bowel obstruction with new onset of copious bilious vomiting. An abdominal ultrasound found a small amount of fluid in the pelvis. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a high-grade small bowel obstruction, with 2 areas of small bowel, suspicious for intussusception (Figures and ). The patient's hemoglobin was found to have dropped from 9.9 to 6.2.\nHe was brought to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperatively, bloody ascites and multiple dilated loops of small bowel were found. Approximately 30 cm of the distal jejunum was found to be tense, heavy, firm, and discolored with a blue hue, with a hematoma that had dissected through the layers of the bowel (). A serosal defect was found on the antimesenteric border of the involved bowel, likely causing the bloody ascites. As the bowel was severely compromised, a resection of the involved segment was performed.\nPathologic analysis of the resected bowel showed an extensive, 35 cm submucosal hematoma causing internal bulging of the mucosa and submucosa, causing attenuation and focal pressure necrosis of the muscularis propria. The serosa was noted to be diffusely purple-red, with a small ovoid defect that was presumably caused by the hematoma. At both ends of the resected bowel, there was evidence of the mucosa and submucosa bulging into the lumen of the bowel as a result of the hematoma.\nThe patient recovered from the operation in the pediatric ICU with no further episodes of emesis or signs of bowel obstruction. He was restarted on LMWH 5 days later and completed his 3-month course without any further signs of bleeding. He was discharged from the hospital 3 weeks later with resolution of his seizures to a rehabilitation facility, without any further complications of bleeding or bowel obstruction.", "topic_list": "['underlying processes/pathways', 'mechanisms, drugs', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'interprets laboratory or other study findings', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}
{"clinical_note": "40-year-old male patient was referred to our department with two-month history of ocular focusing deficit without any signs or symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction. Past illness or family history did not reveal any presence of thyroid-related diseases. He has not been taking any medication but has consumed 20 cigarettes a day for 20 years.\nOphthalmological examination has revealed double vision on upward gaze with disturbance in upward movement of the left eye, eyelid retraction, and exophthalmos of the left eye. Intraocular pressure and visual acuity were normal. The exophthalmoses on the right and left sides were 15mm and 19mm by Hertel exophthalmometer (normal range: 10~15mm with laterality of less than 3mm for the Japanese). Clinical activity score (CAS) of the ophthalmopathy was 2 with redness and swelling of the eyelid.\nAlthough no physical sign of thyroid dysfunction was observed, thyroid function tests were performed since Graves' ophthalmopathy was suspected. Plasma FT3, FT4, and TSH levels were as 2.75pg/mL, 1.38ng/dL, and 0.934\u03bcIU/mL, respectively, and were within the normal range (). Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb), thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb), and TSH receptor autoantibodies (TRAb) were all negative. Only TSAb was slightly positive: 146% (normal range \u2266120%) (). Rheumatoid factor was negative and Immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, and IgM levels were all within normal range. Although C3 or C4 levels were also within normal range, CH50 was slightly higher (59.4 U/mL) than the normal range (32-48 U/mL). Kidney and liver functions were within normal limit. HBV, HCV, HTLV-1, and HIV were negative.\nUltrasonography of the thyroid gland was performed. It showed normal-sized gland with slightly enhanced blood flow (). To directly measure thyroid activity in vivo, 99mTc scintigraphy was then performed. The result was again negative with 99mTc uptake of 0.50% for the right gland, 0.39% for the left gland, and total 0.89% (normal <5% in total) (). These serological and imaging studies of the thyroid has scarcely given positive evidence for the diagnosis of Graves' disease in this patient.\nWe next performed imaging analysis of the orbital cavity. CT scan showed obvious enlargement of the inferior rectus muscle of the left eye (). MRI images of the orbit again showed inferior rectus muscle swelling of the left eye (). Fat-suppression T2-weighted images showed a slight increase in the MR intensity of the muscle involved (), suggesting active inflammation of the extraocular muscle. No tumorous lesion was detected within the orbital cavity (Figures and ).\nWith these findings, the differential diagnosis of this case were (1) euthyroid Graves' ophthalmopathy with a slight increase in TSAb alone or (2) idiopathic inflammation of the extraocular muscle []. Based on the insidious onset, absence of ocular pain, predominance of inferior rectus muscle swelling, and apparent muscular swelling with minimally swollen tendons [\u2013], we diagnosed this case as TRAb-negative euthyroid Graves' ophthalmopathy.\nUnder the diagnosis, he was hospitalized and treated with the combination of corticosteroid pulse therapy and radiation therapy of the orbit (). Intravenous administration of methylprednisolone 1000mg/day for 3 days followed by oral prescription of prednisolone 30mg/day for 4 days were undertaken as the first cycle of the medical therapy. He underwent this medical therapy for consecutive three cycles with a slight modification of decreased methylprednisolone dose (500mg/day) in the third cycle due to a slight elevation of the liver function tests. After the third cycle of the therapy, he was given oral prednisolone as an out-clinic patient. The corticosteroid doses were decreased by 5mg every two weeks until cessation. On the second day of the first cycle of the corticosteroid pulse therapy, daily orbital radiation therapy of 2Gy/day was initiated and performed for ten days (20Gy total). Although the swelling of the left eyelid disappeared on day 3 (), proptosis, abnormality in ocular movement, and diplopia were all unchanged until discharge. Examination by the exophthalmometer revealed the remaining of the exophthalmoses of 16mm on the right and 18mm on the left when he left hospital on day 18 (). Thyroid function remained within the normal range throughout the clinical course and TSAb turned negative (113%) four months after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}

He reported prior history of incarceration. He denied recent travel or animal exposures at home. He resided with his mother, for whom he was the primary caregiver. He denied having sexual activity within the past 6 months. Initial vitals in the emergency department were significant for tachycardia with HR in the 120's. Physical examination at the time of admission revealed a thin, nontoxic appearing male. Cardiac exam revealed tachycardia, with no murmurs or rub. Lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds in the bilateral lower lung fields with tubulovesicular sound emanating from right upper lung field. His abdomen was soft and nontender. He had no focal neurologic deficits. Initial laboratory workup was significant for absolute CD4 count of 26 (3%). Urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 1+ blood, positive nitrite, 3+ leukocyte esterase, WBC >50/HPF, RBC 3-9/HPF, and many bacteria. Chest X-ray (CXR) (PA and lateral views) in the emergency department revealed a cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level within the anterior medial right hemithorax and a loculated hydropneumothorax along the right lateral lung base (). CT chest with contrast demonstrated two large, thick-walled cavitary lesions originating within the right lung parenchyma that appeared to communicate. The smaller lesion measured up to 5 cm and the larger lesion contained an air-fluid level. This was interpreted as demonstrating a complex bronchopleural fistula and associated empyema (). His treatment was initiated with intravenous Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole. The patient's stool PCR isolated a Salmonella species. Diagnostic thoracentesis yielded purulent fluid with WBC 505,000 (73% segmented neutrophils, 8% lymphocytes, and 19% macrophages), RBC 0, pH 6.0, protein 3.7, LDH 41,239, and glucose 12. Pleural fluid culture was positive for Salmonella species. Due to presence of empyema, a right-sided chest tube was placed followed by instillation of tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) and DNase twice daily for three consecutive days. His urine culture yielded nontyphi Salmonella. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast demonstrated two rim-enhancing hypodense lesions (measuring 2.9 x 3.8 cm transverse and 3.2 x 4.5 cm transverse) within the central mesentery of the abdomen (). Intra-abdominal drains were placed under CT guidance into the mesenteric abscesses, from which nontyphi Salmonella eventually grew late in hospital course. Due to immunocompromised status with cavitary lesions on imaging, acid fast bacilli (AFB) smears were obtained along with interferon gamma release assay which were negative. On hospital day #4 the patient's right-sided chest tube was noted to have persistent air leak. CT chest without contrast confirmed persistent right-sided hydropneumothorax with centrilobular ground glass opacities with lung entrapment. On hospital day #10, the patient underwent right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with decortication. Pleural peel pathology revealed pleural fibrosis, focal chronic inflammation, and mild anthracosis. The patient completed an additional two weeks of antibiotic therapy with intravenous Ceftriaxone from the date of decortication. On follow-up at four-months, CT chest demonstrated improved but persistent loculated right pneumothorax with resolution of the right lung cavitary lesions.

He was brought back to our ER with left eye purulent discharge, which was noticed since birth, and swelling of his left upper eyelid of 2 days duration.\nThere was no associated fever or history of decreased level of activity or feeding. There was no history of rashes or seizures.\nThe pregnancy course was remarkable only for gestational diabetes and the fact that the mother had a history of vaginal discharges, which was treated as vaginal candidiasis during the last trimester. Group B streprococcus screening on the 37th week of gestation was negative. Similarly, HIV and hepatitis B serology were negative one day prior to delivery. There was no maternal history of genital lesions, vesicles, or ulcers.\nExamination was normal apart from the purulent eye discharge & swelling of the left eye upper eyelid. The eye secretions were yellowish sticky, copious, and profound. Fontanelles were soft & primitive reflexes were present and normal.\nDue to suspicion of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum, a full septic workup was obtained including CBC, blood culture, urine analysis and culture, CSF analysis and culture, and left eye swab for culture and Chlamydia antigen (). He was subsequently started on meningitis dose of Cefotaxime, in addition to Gentamycin ophthalmic drops while waiting for the previous cultures' results. Azithromycin was added as well to cover the possibility of an associated chlamydial infection.\nThe eye swab culture revealed Neisseria gonorrhea, which was sensitive to Cefotaxime, so the antibiotic was continued while waiting for the results of the CSF culture.\nBlood and urine cultures were negative. The CSF culture revealed Gram-negative rods after one day, which was identified as S. maltophilia on day 5 of admission. The organism was sensitive to Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).\nOnce the diagnosis of S. maltophilia meningitis was identified, Cefotaxime was stopped and the baby was started on TMP-SMX and Ciprofloxacin. Since there are no clear guidelines on how to treat S. maltophilia meningitis in neonates, we extrapolated our management plan from that of other Gram-negative meningitis. Therefore, CSF was repeated at 2 days of antibiotics to confirm sterility. Because S. maltophilia meningitis is very rare and there are no clear guidelines on the duration of therapy, the treating team decided to repeat CSF studies one more time toward the end of the third week of antibiotics. The last CSF studies were completely normal, and the culture was negative.\nThe baby's head circumference was measured daily during the hospital stay and remained normal.

He was not tender to palpation across his bony prominences. He had no medial or lateral joint line tenderness. He had a range of motion that was full and symmetric with that of the contralateral side. He had a negative McMurray's sign. His knee was stable to ligamentous examination. There was no erythema or lymphadenopathy. X-ray of the left knee showed a joint effusion. MRI of his left knee also demonstrated a joint effusion with a popliteal cyst and synovial thickening ().\nHe subsequently underwent aspiration of the effusion in the office. Synovial fluid was cloudy yellow and blood-tinged.

Bacterial culture did not demonstrate any growth, but fungal cultures grew branching narrow hyphae with septations and conidia in a bouquet-like appearance leading to a presumptive diagnosis of Sporothrix schenkii (). The patient was admitted to the University of Kansas Hospital for further management.\nThe patient underwent diagnostic left knee arthroscopy, irrigation, debridement, and major synovectomy. There was no internal derangement of the knee. There was no chondral injury. He had no evidence of a medial-lateral meniscus tear. His anterior cruciate ligament was intact. There was significant synovial thickening throughout. Blood counts, liver biochemistry, coagulation parameters, and renal and thyroid functions were normal except for elevated liver function tests consistent with his history of alcohol use. ESR and CRP were within normal limits, HIV test was negative, and immunodeficiency workup (humoral immunodeficiency, phagocytic disorders, and T-cell immunodeficiencies) was unrevealing. Abdominal CT done to evaluate for disseminated disease showed marked diffuse hepatic steatosis.

No pathology was observed in the larynx\u2014the color of mucosa was normal, and the vocal cords were mobile and smooth. No additional structures were seen. Neck lymph nodes could not be palpated.\nDue to the suspected pharyngeal tumor, the patient underwent a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) study, which showed a clearly limited, oval-shaped lesion in the left parapharyngeal space ().\nThe size of the tumor was 4.2 \u00d7 3.3 \u00d7 6.7 cm. It was characterized by a nonhomogeneous structure with multifocal intratumoral hemorrhages of varying ages. The tumor encased the carotid arteries and the styloid process, while it stretched the pterygoid muscles on the left side and remodeled the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone. The medial part of the tumor pushed the palatal tonsil and uvula towards the centerline, as well as the root of the tongue to the front and the middle. Moreover, it significantly deformed the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cavities. The upper part of the tumor ascended and tapered to the bone surface of the base of the skull and extracranial oval foramen. The lower pole of the tumor reached the submandibular salivary gland level and dislocated it slightly laterally.\nTo clarify the diagnosis, the patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. The study showed that due to its localization and tumor-specific features, the most likely diagnosis was schwannoma of the small branch of the mandibular nerve (V3) since a limited formation of specific localization with a component of cystic degeneration was found. Deformed from the medial part, the lateral pterygoid muscle with the V3 is shown in .\nTo determine a final diagnosis and plan a further treatment, a biopsy with histological verification of the tumor was performed. Under local anesthesia, a punch biopsy was carried out. A histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma. Transoral removal of the tumor was planned. During an angiographic study prior to the surgery, the tumor-feeding blood vessels, of which the main vessel was the left ascending pharyngeal artery, were identified and embolized ().\nAfter the preparation of the patient, the schwannoma extirpation through a 5 cm incision at the left wall of the pharynx from the hard palate to the root of the tongue was performed under general anesthesia, while the widening of the oropharynx was done with a throat gag. The tissues were bluntly separated and the tumor capsule was reached, while the bloodstream of the surrounding area was externally disconnected. The tumor was removed in parts, thus reducing its volume. Later, it was totally removed with a capsule. No postoperative complications were observed. The wound healed by primary intention. The patient was discharged for further outpatient treatment on the sixth postoperative day. Antibiotic therapy with penicillin and painkillers was prescribed postoperatively.\nHistological examination of the operating material revealed a tumor that formed by monomorphic, mitotically inactive spindle-shaped cells with oval nuclei and an eosinophilic cytoplasm, which were positive for S100 calcium-binding protein P ().\nCells were either fascicular or palisade in structure. Larger individual cells with large and irregularly shaped nuclei were found. Furthermore, thick-walled blood vessels, xanthoma accumulations of macrophages, and abundant groups of hemosiderophages with several foci of necrosis were also visible.

IgG was measured at 6390 mg/dL, and immunoglobulins of all other types were decreased. Hematopathology revealed extensive bone marrow involvement (90%) by plasma cells, nearly absent iron stores, moderate normocytic normochromic anemia, reticulocytopenia with prominent rouleaux formation, moderate thrombocytopenia, and absolute lymphopenia. Cytogenetics revealed an abnormal hyperdiploid karyotype including a der(19)t(1q;1p) chromosome with additional copies of CCND1, RB1, and LAMP1, loss of chromosome 17 centromere, and p53 gene disomy. The patient was first started on lenalidomide and dexamethasone and progressed despite multiple chemotherapeutic regimens including bortezomib and dexamethasone, additional cycles of lenalidomide and dexamethasone, melphalan with thalidomide and prednisone (MPT), and bortezomib and dexamethasone.

Microscopic evaluation of the urinary sediment revealed dysmorphic red blood cells suggesting glomerular disease (2 red blood cell casts and 60\u201380 red blood cells per high-power field with >10% of G1 cells and >80% dysmorphic erythrocytes). The spot urine protein to creatinine ratio obtained on the 5th day of hospital stay was also elevated (929 mg/g). Furthermore, both urine and blood cultures came back negative, and no fever was recorded during the hospital stay. Ceftriaxone was discontinued after 7 days of treatment.\nA biopsy of the left kidney was performed at the 6th day of hospital stay and confirmed a diagnosis of IgA nephropathy (immunofluorescence was strongly positive for mesangial IgA deposition, complement component C3, and lambda light chains and moderately positive for IgM). The patient denied any recent respiratory tract infection symptoms. Other lab tests sent during her hospital stay were normal (lactate dehydrogenase, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin IgG and IgM, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I IgG and IgM, protein electrophoresis, serum complement C3c and C4 level, rheumatoid factor, and transesophageal echocardiography). She was started on lisinopril 5 mg daily. Furthermore, considering the significant proteinuria, the elevated creatinine and the negative prognostic features of the biopsy, (M1E1S1T0C1 according to the Oxford classification []) she was started on glucocorticoids (three-day pulse of methylprednisolone 1g in months 1, 3, and 5 in addition to oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg every other day for 6 months) []. At follow-up at 2 months, both creatine (0.86 mg/dl) and the spot urine protein to creatinine (114 mg/g) were normal.

{"clinical_note": "The body of an 84-year-old man was received under the Saint Louis University (SLU) Gift Body Program of the Center for Anatomical Science and Education (CASE) with an informed consent from the donor. Records indicate this man's cause of death was a gastric carcinoma. During routine dissection, a bifid penis was observed. At first glance the phallus resembled that of epispadias, but there were no defects or repair in the external abdominal wall. The pubic hair was sparse and fine. The phallus was 9.2 cm. long, divided longitudinally into right and left parts (). Each part had its own glans and prepuce. There was no urethra in the phallus. Rather, a urethral meatus was located at the base of the divided phallus () which is indicative of proximal penoscrotal hypospadias [, ]. The urethra continued into the normally developed urinary bladder. The epithelial lining of the urinary bladder extended to 3.9 cm. on the ventral surface of each phallus and histologically it resembled stratified squamous epithelium. The scrotum was large with redundant skin and contained left and right testes, from which extended a normally routed spermatic cord. The right testis was 3.0 long and 2.3 cm wide and the left testis was 1.4 cm long and 0.8 cm wide. The spermatic cord on both sides was 1.2 cm in thickness, continued from each testis and passed through the external and internal inguinal rings and took a normal course to end in well-developed seminal vesicles. The seminal vesicles opened into the urethra. The spermatic cord was of normal thickness and size, contained all of the general coverings, but there was no epididymis. The vas deferens continued directly from each testis to the seminal vesicle of the same side. A small mass, measuring 0.5 cm by 0.5 cm, of hard tissue was found only on the left side and was located at the site of the prostate gland but histologically it did not resemble prostatic glandular tissue. It did not have any connection with the vas deferens or seminal vesicle. Dissection of the phallus revealed a corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum in each half of the penis and the corpora spongiosa were well developed as in females (). No other abnormalities were observed.\nIn summary, the anatomical examination of the human cadaver described above characterizes the respective case as a complete bifid penis, a subset of human diphallia, which was accompanied by proximal penoscrotal hypospadias. The lack in this case of additional malformations often associated with diphallia (see above) makes it a perfect model for correct assessment of its etiology.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

The pain localized to the periumbilical region and left lower back, and it was exacerbated with food intake and sometimes relieved by 5 mg hydrocodone tablet. He also reported nausea and fifteen pounds weight loss over the two months, which he attributed to decreased food intake. The physical examination showed a 1 cm tender and irreducible mass superior to the umbilicus. The patient underwent herniorrhaphy and the gross examination of the surgical specimen did not reveal any masses or lesions.\nThe microscopic evaluation showed diffuse infiltration of the connective tissue by malignant cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (). There were focal areas of gland formation with mucin production, consistent with adenocarcinoma. By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were strongly positive for pancytokeratin and CK7 () and negative for CK20, CDX2, TTF-1 and PSA.\nThe laboratory findings showed elevated levels of CA 19-9 (16,590 U/mL) and CEA (14.2 ng/mL).

Her headache started the evening prior to presentation, was gradual in onset and frontotemporal in location, and improved with acetaminophen but subsequently woke her from sleep. It was accompanied by two episodes of emesis. On presentation to the ED, the patient described her headache pain as 3 out of 10 in severity. She denied photophobia, had no further nausea, and denied abdominal pain. She reported that the headache worsened with standing and improved with lying down. Review of systems was significant only for pallor.\nThe patient was otherwise healthy with no prior medical issues and taking no regular medications. She was fully vaccinated and had no known allergies. Her family history was significant for frequent headaches in her mother and maternal aunt. She was living with her parents and brother and attending 4th grade.\nVital signs demonstrated blood pressure 111/56, pulse 104, temperature 37.1\u00b0C, respiratory rate 22, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. Initial exam revealed a well-appearing female and was unremarkable including a normal fundoscopic exam and a normal complete neurologic exam.\nThe patient received ibuprofen and oral rehydration and her headache further improved. A presumptive diagnosis of migraine headache was made and was discharged with primary care follow-up the following day.\nTwo days after her initial emergency department visit, the patient returned to the ED with worsening headache, myalgia, subjective fever, and diffuse weakness. The patient's mother reported that the patient was unable to stand or walk and as a result her mother had been carrying her, including to and from the bathroom. The patient endorsed nausea but no further vomiting.\nVital signs demonstrated blood pressure 105/49, pulse 123, temperature 36.9\u00b0C, respiratory rate 30, and oxygenation saturation of 97% on room air. On exam, the patient was moderately ill appearing, lying in bed responding slowly to questions. Her lips were noted to be cracked and with some oozing blood. No oral lesions were noted in the mouth. Pupils were equal, round, and sluggishly reactive bilaterally. Neck was supple with no adenopathy noted. Cardiovascularly, she was noted to be tachycardic with a regular rhythm and II/VI flow murmur. Her respiratory exam was normal. Her abdominal exam was benign with no organomegaly. Neurologically the patient was noted to be slow to respond to questions and moving slowly but without focal deficits. She was, however, unable to walk without assistance. Skin exam revealed diffuse ecchymoses on the lower extremities bilaterally.\nLaboratory studies were ordered along with a rapid brain MRI, and pediatric neurology was consulted.\nLaboratory results were as follows: hemoglobin 2.6 g/dL, hematocrit 8.3%, platelets 10K/uL, and WBC 60.5K/uL with 83% blasts in the differential. CRP was 15.7 mg/L, and ESR was 125 mm/h.

{"clinical_note": "A 56-year-old man was admitted to our hospital after resection of a lymph node in his groin revealed adenocarcinoma. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a 9-cm mass extending from the bladder to the umbilicus, along with intraperitoneal nodules suggesting peritoneal dissemination (Figures , , and ). Cystoscopy showed an extrinsic mass located on the dome. Serum assays showed high levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), to 16.3 ng/mL, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), to 230.9 U/mL. The patient was diagnosed with urachal carcinoma with suspected peritoneal dissemination and was started on systemic chemotherapy with intravenous gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle) plus cisplatin (70 mg/m2 on day 2 of each cycle). After two cycles, a CT scan showed no marked changes in the lesion; after four cycles, his serum CEA and CA19-9 concentrations had decreased to 4.2 ng/mL and 76.1 U/mL, respectively. However, after five cycles, his CEA concentration had increased to 8.3 ng/mL and his CA19-9 concentration had also increased to 304.1 ng/mL with a CT scan showing changes in the tumor and the appearance of abdominal fluid (). Because of the considered histological and clinical similarities between colorectal and urachal carcinoma, his treatment was changed to FOLFIRI (i.v. infusion of 180 mg/m2 irinotecan, 200 mg/m2 \u2113-leucovorin, and 400 mg/m2 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on day 1 of each 14-day cycle, followed by continuous infusion of 2400 mg/m2 5-FU for 46 hours) after receiving informed consent. After 11 cycles of FOLFIRI, serum tumor marker levels had not changed markedly, but a CT scan showed a reduction in tumor size to 7 cm () and no new distant metastases. Because chemotherapy was able to suppress tumor progression, a surgical approach was chosen, and complete resection of the tumor, along with partial cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection, was performed. The tumor was found to adhere to surrounding organs with mucinous fluid, with disseminated nodules present in the greater omentum. The tumor was removed, along with surrounding adherent organs, including the bladder dome, omentum, peritoneum, abdominal rectus muscle, and vermiform appendix. Cytology showed that the mucinous fluid in the abdominal cavity was class V and the final pathological diagnosis was urachal mucinous adenocarcinoma with invasion of the omentum and peritoneal dissemination (). There were no lymph node metastases, and surgical margins were negative. The patient was discharged from the hospital 14 days after surgery with no complications. Soon after surgery, his serum tumor markers had normalized. Tumor marker levels were measured every month and CT scans performed periodically until six months after surgery. Subsequent follow-up included CT scans and tumor marker level measurement every three months for the first three years and every six months thereafter. At the time of writing this report, i.e., 62 months after surgery and without any adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient remains alive. Although he showed a slight increase in serum CEA level to 6.3 ng/mL, his serum CA19-9 level remained within normal limits (), and no radiological recurrence has been detected.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

The parents could not specify whether there was any connection with standing, coughing, or effort and she had no urge to void.\nShe was constantly wet but had normal voiding habits. On initial physical examination the external genitalia appeared normal with no vaginal pooling of urine or ectopic ureteral orifice. However, a long-term external genitalia examination revealed normal urethral and vaginal openings, with an intermittent urine leakage through the vaginal orifice, which slightly increased in abdominal pressure.\nIn her past history she had recurrent febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) since her infancy. At the age of 3 she underwent an abdominal ultrasound that suspected a double left kidney. A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) was performed and a vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) grade III on the right kidney was found. She was given chronic chemoprophylaxis without any UTI recurrence. She had a good toilet training and gave up daytime diapers around the age of 3. At this moment parents noticed the urinary incontinence, but this didn't bother them. At the age of 4 parents asked a urologist for help, who considered the symptoms to be the result of an overactive bladder and anticholinergic treatment was recommended. No improvement was noticed, and for this reason the little girl was sent to our department for further investigation.\nComplete blood count, biochemical tests, and urinalysis were all normal and the urine culture was negative.\nAn abdominal ultrasound was performed and both kidneys had normal parenchyma and size, with a duplex-system suspicion on left side; the bladder was normal in appearance. The VCUG was repeated but no VUR was visualized. As we had a high suspicion of an ectopic ureter a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to visualize the entire urinary tract. The CT scan was performed with a 64 row MDCT system (Siemens Somatom Definition AS). The 3D images revealed important data about the entire collecting system and the ureters, namely a duplicated collecting system on the left side and subsequently both ureters extending from the kidney to the point of extravesical insertion into the vagina. The ectopic ureters were in very close vicinity (Figures \u2013).\nIn the evaluation of urinary incontinence in children of this age a differential diagnosis should be considered with the following: UTI, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, overactive bladder, ectopic ureter and vesico-vaginal fistula in case of a history of pelvic surgery.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

The patient\u2019s blood glucose was 469 mg/dL, anion gap levels were within reference range, and his glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 12.4%. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit and face revealed severe sinusitis with possible orbital cellulitis and optic nerve compression (Figure ).\nOn the day of admission, the patient was started on an IV ampicillin and sulbactam combination (3000 mg/mL every six hours) and IV vancomycin (1500 mg/mL loading dose; 1250 mg/mL every 12 hours maintenance dose; target vancomycin trough of 10 to 20 mg/mL due to the severity of the infection). The patient was seen by the infectious disease (ID) team on day two of admission. The ID team recommended continuing vancomycin, switched the ampicillin/sulbactam combination medication to piperacillin/tazobactam (3375 mg/mL every six hours) and started the patient on empiric IV liposomal amphotericin B (400 mg/mL daily) given the concerns for invasive fungal infection. The patient was seen by ophthalmology team, and they recommended no acute surgical intervention. However, the otorhinolaryngology (ENT) team performed an endoscopy of the nasal sinuses on the second hospital day, and the patient required extensive debridement of the necrotic tissue of the right sinuses.\nBiopsy results from the nasal sinuses showed broad hyphae with infrequent septations, haphazard branching, and numerous bizarre forms. These morphologic features were consistent with mucormycosis. Given this finding, the patient was continued on IV liposomal amphotericin B.\nA second MRI of the orbit and face was repeated on the fourth hospital day and showed the progression of the disease including involvement of right retrobulbar fat and right optic nerve, persistent non-enhancing, and likely necrotic tissue extending from the right pterygopalatine fossa into the right masticator space (Figure ). Suspected osteomyelitis was noted at the base of the skull, and we noted asymmetric right frontotemporal pachymeningeal enhancement with wispy leptomeningeal enhancement along the middle cranial fossa, which was suggestive of meningitis.\nThe neurosurgery team was consulted as the patient had meningeal spread as well. The neurosurgery team deemed the patient inoperable.\nGiven the progression of the disease despite the standard-of-care treatment (i.e., surgical debridement, IV amphotericin B, and control of blood glucose), a literature search was done to find the next best step. Isavuconazole has been used, according to a few case reports [-], as salvage treatment in patients whose condition either failed the IV amphotericin B or were intolerant to it. Therefore, our patient was started on IV isavuconazole (372 mg/mL every eight hours) on the fifth hospital day, and IV amphotericin B (400 mg/mL daily) was continued. Since patient tissue aerobic and anaerobic cultures as well as blood cultures remained negative, piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin were discontinued on the fifth hospital day.\nAn MRI of the orbit and face was repeated 48 hours after the patient was started on isavuconazole and revealed a stable disease. The patient\u2019s IV isavuconazole dose was reduced to 372 mg/mL daily (after receiving IV isavuconazole every eight hours for 48 hours). An MRI was obtained one week later, and it also showed stable disease with no further progression. The patient was switched to oral isavuconazole (372 mg daily), and IV amphotericin B (400 mg/mL daily) was continued. As the patient continued to improve, he was ultimately discharged after 19 hospital days on this regimen with a plan for outpatient follow-up evaluations with the ID, ENT, and ophthalmology teams. The patient was blind in his right eye with cranial nerves III, IV and VI palsies at the time of discharge. However, his left eye was completely intact with normal vision and movement.\nDuring outpatient care, he continued to receive IV amphotericin B (400 mg/mL daily) and oral isavuconazole (372 mg daily). An MRI of the orbit and face after five weeks of this therapy showed some interval improvement of the infectious process (Figure ). After receiving IV amphotericin B (400 mg/mL daily) for 50 days, the medication was stopped, and the patient was continued on oral isavuconazole (372 mg daily). The patient's renal function was checked weekly as the patient was on IV amphotericin B. The patient had baseline creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, it peaked at 1.8 mg/dL and returned to 1.4 mg/dL once the IV amphotericin B was stopped. Fungal cultures and blood samples were monitored for six weeks, and they remained negative.\nAn MRI of the orbit and face was obtained two months later while the patient was treated with oral isavuconazole (372 mg daily), and the imaging continued to show stable disease. Therefore, oral isavuconazole was stopped. By this time, the patient had isavuconazole for a total of four months (both via IV and oral doses). Besides headaches, the patient tolerated the isavuconazole well without any other significant side effects.\nAn MRI of the orbit and face was obtained again nine months after stopping oral isavuconazole, and his disease process has remained stable. Imaging at this time showed some improvement in the condition. The ID team stated the patient was cured. The ENT team still monitors the patient periodically, and, as of this writing, the patient has been over one year off of antifungal medications.\nRegarding the patient\u2019s diagnosis of uncontrolled T2DM, the patient was initially started on basal insulin while as an inpatient, but he was discharged on oral antihyperglycemic agents (metformin, 500 mg twice daily with meals and sitagliptin, 100 mg daily) given better control with oral agents at the time of discharge. His HbA1c improved to 5.0% from 12.4% in three months. The patient\u2019s metformin has been stopped, and his sitagliptin dose has been reduced to 50 mg daily and is the only diabetic medication for the patient as of this writing.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "The patient is a 58-year-old non-smoking female with a history of recurrent papillary thyroid cancer first detected in the 1970s, who throughout her course underwent several surgical resections, repeated therapy with radioactive-iodine, and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) (original history, cumulative radioiodine dose and EBRT dose unavailable). She presented again in 2015 with recurrent thyroid cancer as well as newly diagnosed breast cancer and liver metastases of unknown origin. She was hospitalized for unexplained fevers, failure to thrive, and symptomatic management of disease progression. Prior to this hospitalization, she had undergone an extensive infectious disease workup with an attempt to isolate the cause of her fevers up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit over the preceding three months. No clear etiology was identified. Empiric antibiotics were eventually discontinued, and the presumed diagnosis of tumor fever was made. On discharge, she followed up in the oncology clinic to start lenvatinib, a TKI approved for radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer. Hours after her first dose of lenvatinib, she was taken to the hospital due to two witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. At home she was noted to have shaking of her arms with repetitive movements of her head, lasting about three minutes and followed by post-ictal confusion, with no tongue biting or incontinence noted. She was taken to the emergency department where she had another witnessed seizure that resolved under therapy with lorazepam. The patient was then transferred from the emergency department to a different medical center. Although her presenting blood pressure was not available for review, her blood pressure was noted to be 158/99 mmHg immediately prior to her transfer.\nThe patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, and given persistent seizures, required intubation for airway protection. Physical exam was limited due to sedation. Brain MRI revealed multifocal white matter edema affecting the occipital and parietal lobes with patchy gadolinium enhancement, in a predominantly posterior distribution, but also with frontal lobe lesions with associated vasogenic edema and patchy enhancement (Figure ). A small, acute infarct in the left centrum semiovale on diffusion weighted imaging was also noted. She developed a fever early in this hospitalization and extensive work up for infectious causes revealed right lower lobe pneumonia that was treated with vancomycin and cefepime. Given her fevers and altered mental status, as well as small acute stroke seen on MRI, patient underwent lumbar puncture on hospital day 1 to evaluate for signs of meningitis or systemic vasculitis. Her CSF studies were not consistent with those diagnoses, with 1\u20134 white blood cells per UL, 0\u20131 red blood cells per UL, glucose of 65 mg/dL (normal 40\u201370 mg/dL), protein of 46 mg/dL (normal 15\u201345 mg/dL) and gram stain and culture which was negative for growth. CSF was also negative for oligoclonal bands, herpes simplex virus, Ebstein-Barr virus, John Cunningham (JC) virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, and negative for growth of mycobacteria. Additionally, head and neck CT angiogram did not demonstrate any hemodynamically significant stenosis. Based on these clinical findings of confusion and progression to mental status depression, a presumed diagnosis of PRES was made. It was thought that the small stroke seen on MRI was a separate event and was not contributing to her current clinical picture. On hospital day 2, she required norepinephrine due to mixed distributive and cardiogenic shock. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 36%, decreased from 62% one month prior, with regional wall motion abnormalities, moderate to severe hypokinesis in all basal to mid-ventricular segments, and hyperdynamic apical segments. These findings were consistent with stress cardiomyopathy or reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She was weaned off vasopressors and extubated successfully on day 4. For her stress cardiomyopathy with tachycardia, she was started on captopril and metoprolol.\nA repeat MRI one week later showed marked improvement in the size and number of areas of T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity in the supratentorial cortex and near-complete resolution of the abnormal T2/FLAIR signal in the cerebellar hemispheres, further consistent with PRES. Repeat TTE at that time showed improvement of systolic function with an EF of 56% and no wall-motion abnormalities. She was continued on lacosamide and advised to follow up with neurology for epilepsy management. She was advised to not take lenvatinib. She remained hemodynamically stable on the oncology ward, however she had a non-resolving lactic acidosis without systemic signs of poor organ perfusion that was attributed to her cancer progression. The patient was discharged and ultimately died under hospice-care one week later.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Fasting glucose of 95 mg/dL, HbA1C of 4.74%, BUN 14 mg/dL, Cr 1.05 mg/dL, Anti-HIV test was negative. Viral hepatitis profile were negative. His chest X-ray was normal. He was diagnosed with anemia of chronic disease, alcoholic hepatitis, and xerotic eczema. Computer tomography of the neck showed a concealed ruptured of left external carotid artery 0.9\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.9\u202fcm in size with surrounding hematoma (3.6\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.6\u202f\u00d75.8\u202fcm) at medial aspect of an aneurysm resulted in narrowing of the upper airway (A, B). Urgent surgical exploration on day 0 revealed severe adhesion around pseudoaneurysm (size 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202fcm) confined around common carotid artery, carotid bifurcation, extended to the angle of mandible. The diameter of pseudoaneurysm neck was one cm, located at medial wall of common carotid artery just distal to carotid bifurcation. External carotid artery was obliterated. Angiogram and balloon occlusion was performed at the left common carotid artery. External carotid artery and internal carotid artery were ligated at the arterial stump just beneath the angle of mandible. Pseudoaneurysm was resected and internal content show pus and clot. Surgical margins were not free in gross section. The pus was sent for bacterial culture. Blood agar plate revealed rare growth of whitish colony, direct exam from the colony revealed broad rare septate fungal hyphae. Infectious disease was consulted on day 5 of admission. Serum antibodies to pythium antigen using an in-house rapid immunochromatographic test were positive on day 5. Sabouraud's glucose agar (SGA) grew fungal colony which identified as P. insidiosum by the induction of motile zoospore and confirmed by fungal broad-range 18S rDNA gene polymerase chain reaction. Pathology of carotid artery revealed acute suppurative inflammation () with branching broad rare septate hyphae demonstrated by Gomori Methanamine Silver stain and Periodic acid-Shiff stain (A) Immunohistochemistry stain for P. insidiosum was positive (B). Medical therapy with oral itraconazole 200 mg oral twice daily combined with terbinafine 250 mg oral twice daily were started on day 5. Adjunctive immunotherapy with subcutaneous injection of PIA vaccine 500 microliter (4\u202fmg/ml) was given on day 6 and 18 of admission. Day 5, Computer tomography of the aorta shows atherosclerotic change without aneurysm or dissection. Postoperatively, physical exams revealed narrowing of upper airway, hypoglossal nerve palsy on the left side without motor deficit. Neurology was consulted on day 6. He was diagnosed with hypoglossal nerve palsy secondary to compression of carotid artery aneurysm. On Day 6, MRI and MRA of the brain revealed pseudoaneurysm of carotid artery at left carotid-parapharyngeal spaces (2.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.1\u202fcm) associated with extensive inflammation of the surrounding soft tissue resulting in mild narrowing of upper airway. Left common carotid artery was occluded along the origin to the cavernous part of left internal carotid artery with the evidence of wall enhancement. Multifocal cerebritis consistent with cerebral septic emboli and leptomeningeal enhancement at the left cerebral hemisphere (). The patient underwent second exploration of the left neck on day 9 aiming to remove the residual infected necrotic tissue. Operative findings revealed pus with necrotic soft tissue extended to parapharyngeal space, however artery cannot be defined. The radical neck dissection could not be performed due to the morbidity outweigh the possibility of the cure. Tissue specimen revealed identical findings with the first operation. On day 6, the dosage of terbinafine was increased to 250 mg three times daily, itraconazole was continued. The patient and family decided for palliative care, no aggressive treatment. He was discharged on day 19 of hospitalization. On day 29 after discharge, upon an outpatient visit, his family mentioned that he developed progressive right hemiparesis over the two days after discharge. Physical exams revealed healed surgical wound of the left neck, narrowing of upper airway, neurological exams revealed global aphasia, right facial palsy (upper motor neuron), motor power grade I on the right side. His family denied further investigation. He continued to take combination of oral terbinafine, itraconazole and PIA vaccine. On day 49, upon an outpatient visit, he had flaccid hemiparesis on the right side without other deficit. He received fourth dose of PIA vaccine and continued oral itraconazole and terbinafine.

Ultrasonography revealed a mass consistent with a degenerated myoma measuring 77x82mm, of which subserous component was greater in the posterior wall and endometrial thickness was 7-8 mm, which was concordant with the cycle. The left ovary of the patient was normal, but since the right ovary could not be fully evaluated, computerized tomography (CT) was requested for possible adnexal pathologies. CT demonstrated a hypodense nodular lesion with a diameter of 75 mm that extended to the right adnexal region and MRI with contrast was performed on the patient. MRI revealed a mass with a hypovascular appearance following a heterogeneous and hypointense IV contrast material with a diameter of 8 mm, which appeared to displace the posterior cervix.\nIt is seen that myoma included by central necrosis depleted by cervix in the posterior part of the uterus. Also the development of necrosis was seen and myomatosis was evaluated in favor of degeneration ().\nIn addition, since the patient's pain regressed spontaneously during the follow-up, surgical operation was postponed to perform in elective conditions. After making necessary preparations for the operation, laparoscopic myomectomy was performed. Myoma was not considered suspicious apart from being degenerated. It was removed by morcellating in an isolated bag (Figures , , , and ).\nNo complication or hemorrhage occurred during surgery. As there was not any problem observed during the post-op follow-up, the patient was discharged from the hospital on condition that the pathology report was brought on the second day of post-op. The subsequent report revealed marked cellularity and pleomorphism, extensive necrosis, mitosis >5/10BBA, KI67 proliferation index >%50, weak positivity for p53, and LMS with no detectable lymphovascular invasion.\nThe patient was informed about the pathology report and interned again to perform transabdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salphingoopherectomy.

On reevaluation, she was noted to have diplopia and facial droop, so MRI brain along with MRI/MRA of head and neck with and without contrast was ordered to rule out cerebrovascular accident (CVA). CVA was ruled out; however bone marrow lesions involving the left and the right clivus, right Meckel's cave, and posterior margin of the right cavernous sinus were noted ().\nCT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis with and without contrast were ordered to search for primary malignancy. These studies revealed homogeneous enhancement of the uterus concerning for diffusely infiltrative endometrial carcinoma with associated relatively bulky retroperitoneal adenopathy of the abdomen and bilateral iliac chain adenopathy. In addition, multiple pulmonary nodules were noted along with L sided neck, mediastinal, and right hilar adenopathy ().\nCervical biopsies were obtained disclosing LCNEC of the cervix (). The tumor cells were immunoreactive for neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and chromogranin. They were also immunoreactive for pancytokeratin and p16, the latter a surrogate marker for the presence of high-risk HPV often seen in these cervical carcinomas.

Ultrasound of the right neck revealed parotitis with no abscess. Blood cultures revealed MSSA bacteremia, with parotitis being the presumed source. Transesophogeal echocardiogram was negative, and the patient was subsequently treated with supportive therapy and fourteen days of cefazolin.\nThe patient had a stable clinical course for the next thirteen days. However, on postadmission day 17, the patient developed severe abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability. On examination, the patient's abdomen was diffusely tender and rigid, suggesting peritonitis. Abdominal X-ray revealed features of colitis complicated by perforation. CT abdomen revealed bowel wall edema, pneumatosis, and focal perforation involving the anterior wall cecum/ascending colon, with extensive pneumoperitoneum. The patient was initially resuscitated and taken to the operating room the next day for a laparotomy. Findings in the operating room revealed microperforations of the cecum, large perforation at the splenic flexure, and fecal peritonitis. A subtotal colectomy was performed, as well as intra-abdominal and subphrenic abscesses were drained. The patient remained intubated postoperatively and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Concurrent blood cultures revealed Enterobacter cloacae bacteremia from an intra-abdominal source, and the patient was treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin. However, the patient remained intubated and required continued use of vasopressors in the ICU. Upon examination, the surgical wound demonstrated signs of infection, which along with the patient's clinical status suggested persistent intra-abdominal sepsis. On hospital day 25, the patient went to the operating room again for a washout of the abdomen and creation of a rectal stump mucous fistula. Tissue cultures revealed growth of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium. Antimicrobical treatment with intravenous meropenem and intravenous metronidazole was commenced, for broad coverage of intra-abdominal abscess and sepsis.\nThe surgical biopsy from subtotal colectomy revealed extensive diffuse mucosal inflammation, acute ulceration, and mucosal and transmural ischemic changes from the ileum to the distal colon (). The ulcerated area exhibited granulation tissue that contained cells that diffusely exhibited intranuclear inclusions, morphologically and immunohistochemically consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2) (Figures \u2013).

{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 70-year-old female whose past medical history was significant for arthritis and a right total hip arthroplasty approximately 9 years ago. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for acute cholecystitis was performed approximately at another hospital approximately two months prior to presentation. She developed a surgical site infection with Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteremia following her LC and was treated successfully with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. The postoperative course was also complicated by choledocholithiasis requiring an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stone pulverization and placement of two plastic 10F \u00d7 12 cm biliary stents. Two days prior to admission, she was hospitalized at an outside facility in septic shock with fevers, chills, lethargy, altered mental status, and blood and urine cultures positive for E. coli. At that time, she endorsed right hip pain and an inability to move her hip or leg. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her right hip revealed two partly calcified soft tissue masses associated with the right iliopsoas and obturator internus muscles (). A CT-guided fine needle biopsy of the right hip and psoas locules aspirated 100 mL of frank pus notable for a nucleated cell count of 344,000 (98% PMNs) with growth of E. coli. As a result, the patient was transferred to our institution with concerns for an iliopsoas abscess and a periprosthetic infection.\nOn admission, she was febrile to 102.7 F without any significant distress. Her physical examination was remarkable for a well-healed, right lateral hip incision with no erythema or drainage. She experienced pain with right hip flexion and internal rotation. Laboratory studies showed WBC, hemoglobin and hematocrit, basic metabolic profile, and liver function tests all within normal limits. A 3 cm hepatic abscess was identified on CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. An MRI of the right hip showed a large air- and fluid-filled collection tracking along the iliopsoas bursa and psoas musculature into the pelvis (). This collection communicated with the hip prosthesis, and on CT imaging, the acetabulum component appeared to be medialized beyond the medial wall of the acetabulum as depicted in . Regarding the hepatic abscess, the patient was managed with IV antibiotics and interventional radiology (IR) placed drainage catheter.\nTo address the hip periprosthetic infection, the patient was managed in multiple surgical stages. In the first stage, an irrigation and debridement of the right hip and explantation of components were performed through an anterior approach. The femoral and acetabular components were explanted. Purulent material was seen draining from the pelvis through a medial acetabular wall defect into the hip joint. Approximately 1 liter of pus was evacuated from the hip joint. Multiple irregularly shaped granulated pea-sized pieces of hard brown substance were found deep in the acetabulum. A handful of this material was removed which suggested that these were spilled gallstones from the patient's recent LC.\nTemporary components were replanted with an antibiotic impregnated cement spacer system [] (Figures and ). An antibiotic cement spacer with gentamicin was placed in the acetabulum defect, and a loosely fitted antibiotic-cemented stem was placed in the proximal femur.\nThe intrapelvic iliopsoas collection could not be fully debrided through the anterior approach, and IR was consulted for drain placement and serial debridements, which were conducted with a rotating basket Trerotola device over the course of the next four weeks. In , contrast dye can be seen tracking from within the iliopsoas abscess into the hip joint.\nFour weeks following her explantation, the patient returned to the operating room for placement of a second temporary weight bearing custom-fitted prosthesis made from methyl methacrylate with gentamicin-impregnated antibiotics [] (Figures and ). For the acetabulum, methyl methacrylate was molded in its doughy state into the cavities and deformities of the acetabulum, and a polyethylene acetabulum was pressed into the cement. The femur was reamed to size of a large diameter chest tube. A femoral stem and a reinforcing wire were cemented into the chest tube, and once the cement was hardened, the femoral stem encased in a solid cylinder of bone cement was removed from the chest tube and malleted into the proximal femur.\nPostoperatively, the patient did well. She was made weight bearing as tolerated, ambulated with physical therapy and elected to delay placement of permanent components. She was eventually discharged to a short-term rehabilitation facility with a 6-week course of IV antibiotics.\nApproximately 18 months later, she presented to our clinic complaining of hip and thigh pain with ambulation. She was followed by infectious disease as an outpatient with multiple hip aspirations which had negative cultures. X-rays revealed her temporary prosthesis to be stable, but with radiolucencies primarily around the femoral component (). The patient was taken to the operating room, the temporary prosthesis was removed, and a long porous coated system was inserted (). Intraoperative cultures grew vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), and the patient was eventually discharged to home with a 12-week course of daptomycin and outpatient physical therapy. Now, two years from her initial explantation, she continues to follow up monthly in our clinic and states that she is doing well. Her final construct is shown in . She continues to have a moderate limp but ambulates without assistive devices. Her pain is much improved and she is no longer on chronic antibiotic suppression with no clinical signs or symptoms of recurrent infection.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 50-year-old female patient presented with a one-week history of decreased vision in her left eye. She had a 15-year history of seropositive RA treated with methotrexate and deflazacort. Because of an unsatisfactory response to those regimens, she was initiated on 25 mg per week of etanercept 8 months prior to presentation.\nOn presentation, her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.8 OD and 0.1 OS. There were no cells in the anterior chamber of either eye. Funduscopic examination showed granular infiltration at the temporal macula in the right eye and the foveal area in the left eye (Fig. ). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed a swollen ellipsoid zone and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) irregularities in the right eye and an ellipsoid zone disruption and RPE irregularity in the left eye (Fig. ). Fundus autofluorescence showed parafoveal granular hyperautofluorescence in both eyes (Fig. ).\nBased on the negative results of various blood tests, she was diagnosed with noninfectious uveitis and started on oral prednisolone. She noticed mild improvement 1 month after treatment, but 2 months after treatment she showed a visual loss to 0.1 in her right eye. Compared with the initial visit, the swollen ellipsoid zone area extended under the fovea and subRPE yellow-white deposits were newly developed in the inferotemporal area (Fig. ). Also, mild vitreous opacity with haziness was noticed in the right eye. We suspected primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL), and a 25-gauge microincision vitrectomy in right eye was performed. Vitreous cytology revealed atypical mononuclear cells with positive CD20 immunostaining. PCR of the vitreous fluid was negative for herpes and cytomegalovirus.\nThe patient was evaluated by an oncologist, and no lymphoma involvement in the brain was found. She was treated with high-dose systemic methotrexate as well as intravitreal methotrexate injections (400 \u03bcg/0.1 mL) twice weekly for 4 weeks for induction, once weekly for 8 weeks, and once monthly for 9 months in the right eye. Given the potential causal relationship between PIOL and anti-TNF\u03b1 agents, etanercept was discontinued.\nThree months after treatment, her right eye showed a decrease in subretinal infiltration and subRPE deposits, which further resolved at 6 months following treatment (Fig. ). Over the course, her left eye also showed gradual improvement in funduscopic examination as well as SD-OCT findings without intravitreal methotrexate injection, potentially due to systemic chemotherapy. Because of severe photoreceptor disruption, BCVA was 0.1 OD and 0.4 OS at the final visit.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 20-year-old African American man was admitted to a psychiatric facility for psychosis. On initial presentation, the patient had an antalgic gait, which he attributed to his history of dopa-responsive dystonia. His mood was depressed and his affect was restricted. He had disorganized thought process and was slow to recall. He endorsed auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, depressive symptoms, frequent night awakenings, and persecutory nightmares. Per the ambulance report, the patient was wandering the streets in a confused state, so bystanders called 911. The patient stated that he had been homeless for the past 3 weeks. During this 3-week period, he admitted to not being complaint with his medications. Urine toxicology screen was negative.\nPer medical records, he was diagnosed with dopa-responsive dystonia at age 11 after a 2.5-year history of progressive abnormal gait. He was initially misdiagnosed with tight heel cords at age 10 and treated with serial casting that resulted in good improvement on the right but marginal improvement on the left. His toe walking became more pronounced overtime accompanied by worsening left calf pain and stiffness, increasingly frequent falls, and new onset of intermittent torticollis. These symptoms worsened over the course of the day. He was eventually taken to an urban teaching hospital, where he was diagnosed with dopa-responsive dystonia based on clinical presentation and marked improvement on a levodopa trial. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine was unremarkable at the time.\nAt age 15, he was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. His psychiatric history is also significant for multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, history of previous suicide attempts with medication overdose, and history of trauma. He also endorsed marijuana use since age 15 and daily tobacco use since age 18. He denies using any other illicit drugs. Per collateral information from his mother, his schizoaffective disorder has never been well controlled given the conflicting effects of his medications. She also mentioned that he was placed in individualized education programs as a child due to learning disabilities. His family history is significant for bipolar disorder on his maternal side. His family history on his paternal side is unknown. In addition to carbidopa-levodopa, his outpatient medications included sertraline, divalproex sodium, aripiprazole, and benztropine.\nOn hospital day 1, he was started on carbidopa-levodopa 25/100 mg tablet three times daily for dopa-responsive dystonia. On day 2 of his hospital course, sertraline 50 mg once daily, benztropine 2 mg twice daily, divalproex sodium 500 mg twice daily, and risperidone 0.5 mg twice daily were added to his medication regimen. We started him on a low-dose risperidone to avoid exacerbating his dopa-responsive dystonia symptoms. Physical exams were also performed daily to assess for dystonia and parkinsonian symptoms. His initial physical exam revealed an antalgic gait secondary to left lower extremity dystonia, which improved by hospital day 2 and resolved by hospital day 3. On hospital day 3, he became agitated and aggressive with staff members, which led to intramuscular administrations of haloperidol 10 mg, diphenhydramine 50 mg, and lorazepam 2 mg. He continued to endorse auditory hallucinations, so risperidone was increased to 0.5 mg in the morning and 1 mg at bedtime. His auditory hallucinations resolved and then returned on day 6. He reported hearing \u201cgood\u201d voices and \u201cbad\u201d voices. He also continued to endorse depressive symptoms, multiple night awakenings, and persecutory nightmares. As a result, his risperidone dosage was increased to 1 mg twice daily. On hospital day 7, the patient reported hearing \u201cmumbling\u201d voices only and improvement in his sleep and depressive symptoms. On hospital day 8, his auditory hallucinations fully abated. By hospital day 10, he slept throughout the night, no longer had depressive symptoms, and had normal spontaneous speech. His thought process was linear, logical, and goal-oriented. His mood and affect was euthymic and full range. No psychotic symptoms were noted. The patient was compliant with his medications throughout the whole hospital course and his daily physical exams were negative for dystonia or parkinsonian symptoms since day 3 of his hospitalization.

{"clinical_note": "An 82-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to our hospital in December 2016 with dyspnea, hemoptysis, and impaired general condition. He also presented with pseudoparalysis of his left shoulder due to severe pain. The medical record included ischemic heart disease (coronary artery bypass grafting in 1994), atrial fibrillation, low malignant prostate cancer, gout, and diabetes mellitus type II. Six months prior to admission, the patient had all teeth in his upper mouth removed prior to being fitted with dentures. This dental procedure was complicated with severe inflammation, and the patient was treated several times with oral antibiotics.\nOn admission, the patient was septic with fever and in a condition with pulmonary congestion and bilateral oedema in his lower limbs. Vital parameters included a blood pressure of 148/62 mmHg, a heart rate of 84 beats/min, oxygen saturation of 81% without oxygen supplementation, respiratory frequency at 26 per minute, and a rectal temperature of 38.8\u00b0C. Arterial blood gasses showed a normal pH (7.44), low partial pressure of carbon dioxide (3.5 kPa) and oxygen (7.2 kPa) in arterial blood, and low oxygen saturation (89%). On physical examination, the patient's left shoulder was tender and warm and had an anterior nonerythematous swelling. Cardiac auscultation did not reveal any murmur, and the neurologic examination was normal. The electrocardiogram revealed normofrequent atrial fibrillation and right bundle branch block.\nThe initial blood samples showed leucocytosis (14.7 \u00d7 109/L) with dominance of neutrophilic granulocytes, haemoglobin level of 7.1 mmol/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 216 mg/L.\nChest X-ray showed no infiltrates but was consistent with pulmonary stasis. An X-ray of the left shoulder showed no signs of inflammation.\nBlood cultures (three bottles with 10 ml each) and two samples of synovial fluids from the left shoulder were sent to the laboratory. Next day, growth of Gram-positive cocci was seen in one of the three blood culture bottles and in both synovial fluids. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed on all three isolates using Microflex\u2122 LT MALDI-TOF-System (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany; two databases: 1829023 Maldi Biotyper Compass Library and 8254705 Security ref. Library 1.0 for MALDI Biotyper 2.0), and they were diagnosed as S. equi subspecies zooepidemicus with a score between 2.37 and 2.63. Whole-genome sequencing of the blood culture isolate was performed by 251-bp paired-end sequencing (MiSeq; Illumina) and confirmed the species and subspecies type diagnosed by MALDI-TOF MS. The isolate carried a novel sequence type (ST379), and a phylogenetic analysis using FastTree v2.1.5 of the concatenated MLST alleles () found it to cluster in a branch containing ST60, ST135 and ST162. An analysis using the iTOL implementation at revealed that seven related isolates with those ST types were reported in the database from various hosts (cow (n=1), dog (n=1), and horse (n=5)). The sequence data has been uploaded to ENA with the following Study and Read accession IDs: PRJEB24181 and ERR2233447, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility testing using the Epsilometer test (E-test) (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) showed that the isolate was susceptible to penicillin (0.016 microgram/ml), ampicillin (0.032 microgram/ml), amoxicillin (0.047 microgram/ml), cefuroxime (0.016 microgram/ml), erythromycin (0.094 microgram/ml), clindamycin (0.38 microgram/ml), vancomycin (0.5 microgram/ml), imipenem (0.012 microgram/ml), and rifampicin (0.012 microgram/ml). The isolate was intermediate susceptible to gentamicin (12 microgram/ml).\nAntibiotic treatment the first two days was intravenous cefuroxime 1.5 gram administered three times daily, which was changed to intravenous high-dose benzylpenicillin, initially a dose of 2 million international units (IU) four times a day. The monotherapy with benzylpenicillin was supplemented with intravenous gentamicin in intervals (five days in total). On day three, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (TTE and TEE, resp.) demonstrated a vegetation on the aortic valve () with a minimal aortic insufficiency. There were no signs of paravalvular abscesses and no stenosis of the affected valve. Ejection fraction was normal. The patient was diagnosed with aortic valve endocarditis without indication for acute operation. According to the national Danish guidelines for infective endocarditis, the benzylpenicillin dosage was increased to 5 million IU four times a day.\nOn day three, CRP levels were increasing as well as the pain and oedema in his left arm. On day five, arthroscopic revision of the left shoulder was performed and three biopsies were taken, but none of these cultures showed further growth of the pathogen. The rotator cuff was almost completely degenerated, and the humeral head was devoid of its hyaline cartilage. Ten days later technetium-99m bone scintigraphy showed intense activity in the left shoulder, suspicious of osteitis (). The bone scintigraphy revealed no other focus of infection. On day 17, control transesophageal echocardiography was performed. At this time, the examination showed no suspicious signs of endocarditis, and the vegetation that was previously seen on the aortic valve could not be visualised.\nThe patient was sent to a dentist, which did not reveal any oral focus. The patient's clinical condition improved gradually, and he was discharged from our hospital after five weeks (36 days) with oral antibiotics (oral amoxicillin 1 g \u00d7 3 pr. day and oral rifampicin 600 mg \u00d7 2 pr. day) for further two months. In total, he received antibiotics for almost three months (87 days). During the admission, the patient lost approximately 17 kilograms in weight, primarily fluid associated with his septic condition as well as fluid from some of degree cardiac decompensation and lung stasis.\nThe patient was followed up in the Out-Patient Clinics for Infectious Diseases and Cardiology, which included blood samples and control transthoracic echocardiography. None of the subsequent examinations indicated signs of recurrence. The patient regained normal function in his left shoulder.\nThe patient reported that he had daily contact with animals including horses, though he did not recall any illness in the four horses he had taken care of the past year.

He had suffered an acute episode of myocarditis four years previously requiring hospital admission. He had no other relevant medical history and no family history of cardiac disease. He is a nonsmoker and consumed alcohol occasionally. Clinical examination was unremarkable and did not show any evidence of heart failure or systemic disease. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm without any ischemic changes, and chest X-ray showed no evidence of infection or heart failure. Routine blood tests including antinuclear antibody, creatinine kinase (CK), rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein were all within normal limits apart from an elevated cardiac troponin T with a peak value of 2700 ng/l (<14 ng/l). Further extensive inflammatory, viral, and autoimmune screening was carried out and found to be negative. Subsequent coronary angiogram showed normal coronary arteries, and transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >55% with trace mitral regurgitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive subepicardial and midwall late enhancement typical of myocarditis in the anterior, lateral, and inferior walls along with extensive fibrosis with normal LVEF ().\nA short course of steroids and anti-inflammatory medication as an inpatient resulted in the resolution of his myocarditis symptoms. The troponin T level normalized and the patient was discharged with a plan to repeat cardiac MRI in six months. On follow-up as an outpatient, it was decided to refer the patient to rheumatology for an opinion regarding ongoing immunomodulatory therapy. At this juncture, the patient stated that he also had symptoms of stiffness and aching in his calf muscles for quite some time but he did not consider it to be relevant. Despite persistently normal skeletal muscle enzyme levels, an MRI of the lower legs was performed and this showed active myositis involving the gastrocnemius muscles bilaterally (). As the patient was demonstrated to have ongoing myositis despite minimal symptoms, and as he had accrued significant myocardial scarring from previous episodes of myocarditis, it was decided to commence long-term immunomodulatory therapy in the form of methotrexate and prednisolone. Clinically, the patient reported a significant improvement in his symptoms and a repeat of the lower limb MRI demonstrated a significant interval improvement in his skeletal muscle myositis. Six months later, a repeat of the cardiac MRI demonstrated resolution of myocarditis along with persistent, stable, and extensive myocardial fibrosis and preserved LVEF (). The patient is tolerating the immunomodulatory therapy well without major side effects, and he has returned to full-time work.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}

A needle biopsy was performed, and the results indicated the possibility of an atypical lipomatous tumor. Subsequently, he was referred to our hospital. Physical examination revealed a hard and mobile mass in the left neck, measuring approximately 10 \u00d7 10 cm. Plain X-ray radiographs showed a soft tissue mass with no calcification in the left neck (Fig. ). MR images showed a well-defined and lobulated mass (Fig. a\u2013d). On T1-weighted images, the mass had heterogeneity, with a higher signal intensity than that of muscle (Fig. a). On T2-weighted images, the septum had low-signal intensity (Fig. b). On T2-weighted fat-suppressed images, the signal of the mass was completely suppressed (Fig. c). On gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images, the signal from the mass was enhanced (Fig. d). The SUVmax value of the mass on FDG PET was 1.84, with no abnormal uptake except in the mass (Fig. ). An additional needle biopsy was performed in our hospital, and evaluation of the results resulted in a diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma. The mass was resected marginally because it was considered a low-grade tumor. Macroscopically, the mass was encapsulated and markedly harder than a well-differentiated liposarcoma (Fig. a). The cut surface of the mass was yellowish and lobulated. Histologically, the tumor was composed of myxoid and cartilaginous matrix, and mature fat cells and lipoblast-like cells were present (Fig. b, c).

Pelvic packing was applied on the pelvic vessels for 20 minutes, the bleeding sites were sutured with 1.0 polyglactine sutures, and Sengstaken-Blakemore balloon catheter was placed in the uterus before suturing. A stomach balloon was filled with 250 mL saline and an esophageal balloon was filled with 400 mL saline to provide compression on the lower uterine isthmic and cervical bleeds, nevertheless, bleeding continued. Bilateral uterine and hypogastric artery ligations were planned due to hemorrhage. The left external iliac artery was accidentally held and bonded as the left hypogastric artery, which was released within a minute after distinguishing the vessels. Following this mistake, the uterine and hypogastric arteries were ligated on both sides. The patient lost about 2000 cc of blood due to the intraoperative hemorrhage as measured by adding 1650 cc blood in the aspirator and counted gauzes. She received erythrocyte suspension (3 units preoperatively and 4 unites postoperatively) and 3 packs of fresh frozen plasma. The patient had no findings of hypotension or shock at any time. The patient reported severe pain in both legs in the recovery room; it was observed that left dorsalis pedis and femoral artery pulses were absent. Doppler sonography showed a distinct stricture and triphasic flow loss on the left femoral artery. Diagnostic angiography was performed by a cardiologist. After a 6-F introducer sheath was inserted, it was confirmed that both external iliac arteries were occluded (). Intravenous heparin (100 IU/kg) was administered afterwards. A 6-F left internal mammary artery catheter was used with 0.035 hydrophilic guide wires to cross the occlusion. Angioplasty was performed first to the right and then contralaterally to the left external iliac artery with a standard balloon (8x80 mm). A completion angiogram concluded the procedure. The femoral access site managed manually with digital pressure. The balloon catheter was removed after 30 hours. The patient and her child were discharged on the 4th postoperative day with no further events.

{"clinical_note": "A 35-year-old African American man was initially sent to our emergency room to evaluate a possible head trauma after a witnessed fall. He complained of frequent falls and leg weakness for 3\u20134 months. The weakness appeared to be progressive and persistent without episodic worsening. He had to use a cane to compensate but was still able to ambulate. His family members also endorsed cognitive defects over the past few months before admission. These impairments consisted mainly of apathy and withdrawal from social interactions; he used to be fully independent but now stayed at home most of the time. His medical history was only significant for alcohol abuse (three to four cans of beer and red wine daily for 2 years), and his family history was unremarkable.\nPhysical examinations showed an age-appropriate, alert, and oriented man. He was able to engage in conversations with a paucity of speech and flat affect; he also made eye contact and followed all commands during our evaluations.\nThere was bilateral weakness with spasticity in all lower extremity muscle groups. The deep tendon reflex was hypoactive with an upward response of the plantar reflex on the left side. He also had a wide-based unsteady gait and poor limb coordination. The remainder of the neurological examination and a general examination were unremarkable.\nInitial brain computed tomography (CT) in our emergency room demonstrated a mass lesion occupying the left caudate and extending into his frontal lobe (Fig. ). A brain MRI showed bilateral and symmetric hyperintense signals in the corpus callosum, periventricular white matter, and internal capsule (Fig. ) with an axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence with gadolinium enhancement (Fig. ). A cervical spine MRI was negative for cord compression and abnormal signals.\nRoutine blood tests, as well as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, and thyroid function tests, were unremarkable, and his serum vitamin B12 level was borderline (289 picogram per milliliter). A cerebral spinal fluid sample revealed a mildly elevated protein level (120 mg per deciliter) with a normal cell count (two cells per milliliter) and glucose level (79 mg per deciliter). The sample was negative for cytology, oligoclonal bands, culture, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). His urine toxicology panel was negative for common recreational drugs.\nThe initial impression was an acquired demyelinating white matter disease due to nutritional deficiency. A trial vitamin supplement (500 mg administered intravenously three times a day and 1000 \u03bcg of cyanocobalamin administered intramuscularly daily) was given based on his alcohol abuse history, but no symptom improvements were seen during the following week. An inherited condition was thus suspected given the negative workup, the non-response to treatment, and the symmetric involvement in the brain MRI. This suspicion was validated by his peroxisomal fatty acid profile (Table ), and a diagnosis of X-ALD was confirmed according to the identification of a pathogenic mutation in the ABCD1 gene: c.1489 2A>G (g.153005544). Adrenocortical insufficiency was not identified during the evaluation. No seizure activity was witnessed or shown on video-electroencephalography.\nHis neurological condition deteriorated rapidly. He progressed into a non-verbal, quadriplegic patient dependent on a ventilator within 5 months of the initial encounter, and after 1 year of follow up he had degenerated into a vegetative state. Genetic counseling was offered to his family, and all of his siblings were negative for the ABCD1 gene mutation.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 73-year-old Japanese man on PD presented with progressive worsening of abdominal pain and cloudy peritoneal fluid. He had high blood pressure, and he started continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) because of hypertensive nephrosclerosis 8 years previously. A PD catheter was primarily inserted at the right abdomen, but it was removed and inserted at the left abdomen because of exit site and tunnel infection 5 years previously. He had no past medical history of diabetes mellitus and major abdominal surgery. In the peritoneal equilibration test, his result was high. Bloody ascites was not evident. One year previously, he had been hospitalized for PD-associated peritonitis caused by touch contamination that was treated with intraperitoneal cephazoline and cephtazidime. Bowel adhesion was not noted 5 years previously; however, local bowel adhesions and agglomeration of the intestine were detected by computed tomography (CT) after the identification of PD-associated peritonitis (Fig. , ). The major findings of EPS, such as peritoneal thickening and calcification, were not noted on CT.\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 134/74 mmHg, pulse rate was 76 beats/min, and temperature was 99.7 \u00b0 F. He complained of severe pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and this area was tender on palpation. The exit site was clear. Laboratory tests revealed mild inflammation, with a white blood cell count of 10,100 /\u03bcL and C-reactive protein level of 0.9 mg/dL. The peritoneal fluid cell count was increased at 980 /mL. Based on these findings, PD-associated peritonitis was diagnosed. CT showed localized dilation of the intestine, which suggested adhesive small bowel obstruction (Fig. ). As we suspected that the peritonitis might be associated with bacterial translocation from the dilated intestine, he was advised to stop eating and was switched from CAPD to hemodialysis. Additionally, he was treated with intravenous vancomycin and cephtazidime. The PD catheter was flushed once a day to prevent catheter obstruction with fibrin, and the characteristics of the peritoneal fluid were monitored. His abdominal pain was resolved and peritoneal fluid cell count decreased to < 30/mL, and thus, he resumed oral intake on day 8.\nAfter resumption of oral intake, his abdominal pain worsened and his peritoneal fluid cell count dramatically increased to 9600/mL on day 15. The peritoneal fluid became cloudy with a high amount of fibrin and white blood cells (Fig. ). Although he stopped eating again, his abdominal pain did not improve, and fecal material with foul smell was identified from the PD catheter on day 23 (Fig. ). Culture of peritoneal dialysate on admission was negative; however, culture of peritoneal dialysate on hospital day 23 was positive for Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides caccae. On CT, the intestinal contents disappeared and the dilated intestine collapsed, indicating that the intestinal contents had leaked into the abdominal cavity (Fig. ). Considering these facts, intestinal perforation was diagnosed, and he underwent ileocecal resection with colostomy creation. Although intra-abdominal adhesion was severe, fibrinous encapsulation of the bowel, which would suggest EPS, was not detected macroscopically during surgery (Fig. ). As indicators of EPS were not evident, the PD catheter was removed. The perforation site was located at the adhesive intestine. The tip of the peritoneal catheter was located in Douglas\u2019 pouch, and it did not injure the adhesive intestine. Pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed inflammatory cells associatet with the peritonitis in the intestinal wall. Intestinal fibrosis, arterial alteration, and tissue calcification were not evident pathologically (Fig. , ). Although his serum beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) level was high (41.05 mg/L), amyloidosis and deposition of B2M were not observed (Fig. -). The postoperative course was uneventful and left arteriovenous fistula surgery was performed on day 42.

{"clinical_note": "A 5-year-old asymptomatic female was hospitalized in our center for surgical intervention for ALVT with AORCA and BAV. Tracing back to nearly 1 year, this entity of congenital cardiac abnormalities was accidentally detected by a routine echocardiography at a local hospital, with a misleading preliminary diagnosis as BAV with accompanying aortic regurgitation (AR). The patient and her parents reported no evident symptoms, concomitant congenital dysplasia, noteworthy past medical history and family history of inherited cardiac defects. Physical examination showed a grade IV/VI diastolic murmur at auscultatory area of aortic valve. Detailed results from a repeated echocardiography demonstrated: 1) an abnormal tunnel communicating the aortic root and left ventricle, with the opening of aortic segment at the level of the right posterior sinus (0.63 cm at width) and the opening of ventricular segment at the level of membranous interventricular septum (0.43 cm at width); 2) BAV without evident aortic stenosis or AR; 3) the left and right coronary arteries both originating from the left anterior sinus; 4) an enlarged left ventricle (LV) with normal left ventricular function (LV ejection fraction (LVEF) estimated as 65%). The chest X-ray found no significant aberrance (Fig. ). Additionally, a cardiac CTA further confirmed the diagnosis and revealed an abnormal tunnel between the right coronary sinus and left ventricle (Fig. and ). Because the patient presented no obvious symptoms, no medical treatment was perfomed before the surgery.\nThe patients underwent the surgical repair for ALVT under general anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). After a median sternotomy was performed and CPB was established, cardiac arrest was achieved using antegrade cardioplegia infusion at the root of aorta for myocardial protection. Subsequent to the horizontal incision at the aortic root, a good view for those anatomical abnormalities was obtained. Except that the AORCA and BAV were confirmed by the surgery, the aortic opening of the tunnel was clearly observed. Near anterolateral commissure the separation between the roots of two leaflets formed into a special ostium with the inner wall of aorta (0.6 cm at width) when the leaflets were closed (Fig. ). The gap between the roots of two leaflets was sutured using 5\u20130 running polypropylene to turn off the tunnel (Fig. ). Transesophageal echocardiography during the surgery showed no obvious AR. The surgical course went smoothly and the vital signs of the patient remained stable during the operation. No problem during cardioplegia and protection occurred. The CPB time and aortic clamping time were 103 and 75 min respectively.\nNearly 6 h after the surgery, tracheal intubation was weaned sucessfully. During the postoperative period, the continuous intravenous pumping of low-dose dopamine lasted for 7 h without other inotropic drugs administrated. The patient experienced an uneventful recovery without any complication and was discharged home one week after the operation. Echocardiography at discharge demonstrated the trivial AR and normal LV function with a LVEF of 65% (Fig. ). A long-term follow-up for the patient is highly recommended to detect the potential AR and AS caused by BAV in the future.", "topic_list": "['underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 64-year-old woman was diagnosed with locally advanced DTC with invasion to the trachea, esophagus, and left recurrent nerve (Fig. and Fig. (A)). Bronchoscopy revealed that the invasion to the trachea was under half the tracheal circumference, and the distance from the vocal cord to the oral end of the tumor, invasive to the mucosa of the trachea, was 3 cm. Her past medical history included non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus controlled using insulin injections for a year. She underwent total thyroidectomy with bilateral modified radical neck dissection, followed by a window resection of the trachea invaded by the tumor. A one-stage reconstruction was then performed using an auricular deltopectoral flap. The patient was finally diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), pT4aN1bM0, stage IVA, according to the 7th edition of the Union for international cancer control TNM classification of malignant tumors. The operation was macroscopically curative, although a final histopathological estimation of the tracheal margin was positive. Three months after the operation, apart from tracheal anastomosis and the newly emerged lung metastasis, a recurrent tumor was detected outside the left piriform fossa (Figs. and (B)). Therefore, the patient was given 100 mCi of I-131 therapy. No accumulation of I-131 was detected. Nine months after the operation, the patient felt apparent dyspnea and a dull pain in the right shoulder. A CT scan revealed prominent tumor progression in both the neck and the lung, and bone scintigraphy showed bone metastasis in the right scapula (Figs. and (C)). EBRT was performed for the recurrent neck tumor (60 Gy) and the right scapula (36 Gy), and docetaxel was administered once per 3 weeks for 24 months. Docetaxel was temporarily very effective for the local recurrence, although the lung metastasis was remarkably enlarged (Figs. and (D)). Three years after the operation, the patient was started with the newly emerged TKI sorafenib, but because of the progression of lung metastasis, it was terminated in 9 months (Figs. and (E)), although bone scintigraphy demonstrated the disappearance of bone metastasis. Therefore, 45 months after the operation, lenvatinib was started. There are strict regulations regarding the use of lenvatinib at our facility, which must be adhered to (Table ). Within 2 months after the start of lenvatinib, recurrent tumor and lung metastasis was remarkably decreased [partial response (PR), Figs. and (F)], but 1 month later, coughing and dyspnea appeared and XP demonstrated pneumonia. A CT scan demonstrated a pin-hole perforation of the trachea (Figs. and (G)). The symptoms disappeared 1 month after lenvatinib was terminated, and the tracheal fistula naturally closed (Figs. and (H)). Lenvatinib was then restarted, following which the local recurrence decreased and most metastatic tumors in the lung disappeared within 3 months (Figs. and (I)). However, because of the exacerbation of diabetes involving a foot ulcer, the administration was again halted for 2 months, which led to the exacerbation of lung metastasis (Figs. and (J)). After restarting the administration, diabetes, hypertension, and urinary protein as adverse events were well controlled by drugs and nutrition counseling and lung metastasis was controlled; CT scan demonstrated no recurrence in the neck, and bone scintigraphy revealed no bone metastasis (Figs. and (K)). Till the present, lenvatinib has continued to be effective (PR) 1 year and 9 months after the initiation of the drug (Figs. and (L)).

The patient had a 10-year history of hypertension and was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus approximately 5 years before. He denied history of liver cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The patient underwent splenectomy 5 years earlier owing to a high-altitude falling accident. No mass was identifiable on abdominal palpation exam. Serum tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein, CA199, and CA125) were within the normal range. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) revealed a 5 cm iso-echoic lesion that located in the left hepatic lobe near the capsule. A 1.2 cm gallstone was also observed. An abdominal plane-computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an oval, slightly hypodense mass located in segment IV of the left liver lobe measuring 4.5 \u00d7 3.3 cm. The lesion had an inhomogeneous enhancement during the arterial phase and diminished enhancement during the portal and equilibrium phases on a contrast-enhanced CT scan (Fig. ). Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a slightly hypointense mass on both T1- and T2-weighted images, which appeared slightly hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images. After the injection of gadoxetic acid, the lesion appeared strongly heterogeneous and hyperintense during the arterial phase and relatively hypointense during the portal and equilibrium phases (Fig. ). An indication of a pseudo-capsule was also observed. Partial hepatectomy and cholecystectomy were performed with the suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nDuring the operation, the intrahepatic mass was found to be located in segment IV of the liver, measuring 4.0 cm in diameter. It was completely embedded in the liver tissue, and no other mass was found. Postoperative hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed sinusoidal structures and lymphoid tissue hyperplasia. A capsule separating the spleen tissue from liver tissue could be clearly detected (Fig. ), which confirmed intrahepatic splenosis. Detailed immunohistochemical staining showed positivity for CD3 and CD20, specific markers for lymphocyte T cells and B cells, respectively. Meanwhile, the expression of the Ki-67 antigen was quite limited. The polyclonal nature of the lymphocytes and the low proliferation activity further confirmed the benign characteristic of the mass, as malignant tumors are always monoclonal with active proliferation.

{"clinical_note": "The patient is a 43-year-old man, Latin-American, with degree-level education. He attended the medical consultation after his wife noted a two-year history of progressive forgetfulness, mental confusion, disorientation, difficulty finding the right words, changes in mood (basically from being shy to outgoing). He also lost his job for poor performance and was rejected by his friends as a consequence of his new outgoing personality. Concomitantly, he started experiencing sleep changes and apathy, together with anxiety symptoms. Initially he was treated as suffering from major depression, and later as type II bipolar disorder. The treatments failed to change his behavior. The physical examination was completely normal, including pulmonary and cardiac auscultation (normal echocardiogram), except for multiple skin blemishes, mainly on the trunk. Neither he nor his wife recognized his skin changes as abnormal. The blemishes were spread all around his trunk and belly, and changed rapidly under finger pressure ( - right side with blue arrows). The patient was submitted to neuropsychological tests and we provide here a brief overview of the results: he scored 23 points on the Mini-Mental Status Examination and only 15 points on the MOCA test. He scored 30 points on the HAM-D scale and 20 on the Hamilton anxiety scale. The patient was CDR 1 and FAST stage was 5 (moderate disease). In general, the patient performed poorly on all neuropsychological tests, with moderate-to-severe decline in cognitive functions, including declarative memory, attention, and poor language and executive function results. He also presented many emotional disturbances that were negatively affecting his life. No further neurological signs were found. Lastly, neither the patient nor his wife described any stroke-like episodes. He reported no family history of livedo reticularis, stroke, vasculitis, or SS.\nLaboratory findings showed undetermined anticardiolipin antibodies, besides the weak presence of lupic anticoagulant. Laboratory studies for venereal disease, human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C tests, protein C and protein S, C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear factor and other rheumatic testing were completely normal.\nThe brain MRI () - upper left showed multiple areas of signal changes on cortico-subcortical transition and in the deep periventricular white matter with gadolinium enhancement, consistent with brain ischemia. Imaging also disclosed diffuse cerebral atrophy disproportionate for his age. Brain Perfusion with 99mTc - ECD brain SPECT showed accentuated diffuse hypoperfusion in parietal and frontal areas () - lower left.\nCerebral angiography () revealed slowed distal blood flow of cerebral arteries with decreased vessel diameter and parietal irregularities suggestive of vasculitis. The venous phase was normal, and there was no vascular malformation. The anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries in their respective distal segments showed segmental lesions with reduced caliber associated with tortuosity and slowed flow, characterizing a late blush in the territory of the watershed zone.

{"clinical_note": "We present the case of a 54-year-old female coming to our attention in April 2017 for a single thyroid nodule of 1 cm in its largest diameter, incidentally discovered in the left lobe during an ultrasound US performed for another indication. When the complete biochemical screening (TSH, autoantibodies and Ct) was performed, Ct was found only slightly elevated (40 ng/mL, normal values: 1\u20134.8), therefore a stimulation test with iv calcium was performed. After stimulation, Ct levels peaked at 1420 ng/mL, indicating surgical treatment. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection (level VI) on the side of the tumor. The postoperative course was uneventful, with only a slight hypocalcemia recorded in the first postoperative day, which completely recovered 48 hours after surgery when the patient was discharged. Immunohistochemistry performed on the nodule showed the presence of a polilobulated medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) of 1 cm, composed of cells with fused shape with eosynophilic cytoplasm, agglomerated in solid nests with a predominantly expansive growth pattern (A). A histological examination showed that the tumor cells were positive for Ct, Cromogranin A, Synaptofisin, and TTF-1 (B), and negative for the presence of amyloid (not shown). Focal foci of C-cells hyperplasia were spread in the entire gland. In none of the lymph nodes of the central compartment metastases were found.\nTo perform a more detailed morphological analysis, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections (3-\u03bcm-thick) were subjected to antigen retrieval with citrate buffer at high pH, immunolabeled with rabbit monoclonal anti-calcitonin (SP17, Cell Marque) (), and then incubated with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa546) from Invitrogen/Life Technologies. As shown in , the tumor cells as well as the C-cells found in the surrounding follicolar parenchima expressed strong intracellular positivity for Ct (A,B), (F) (C).\nWe next performed immunofluorescence labeling for the RTK receptors ERBB1 (EGFR), using a polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody (Sigma-Aldrich SRL, Milano, Italy), and ERBB2, using the monoclonal humanized anti-ERBB2 antibody trastuzumab, alexa488-conjugated (10 \u00b5g/mL), (Genetech-Roche, South San Francisco, CA, USA). The slides were examined and imaged with an inverted Olympus microscope (Olympus Italia, Segrate, Italy) at 40\u00d7 and 63\u00d7 magnifications. As shown in A,B, the tumor cells displayed strong punctate positivity for both ERBB1 and ERBB2 receptors, consistent with their localization in intracellular compartments, likely the endolysosomal system. Indeed, double immunofluorescence for ERBB2 and Ct showed a limited overlap of the two proteins, indicating that Ct and ERBB2 were segregated in distinct intracellular compartments.\nFor electron microscopy, small pieces of fresh tissue were immediately fixed after surgical resection in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were double stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined under a transmission electron microscope (TEM, CM10 Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). The ultrastructural examination of the tumor nodule displayed heterogeneous spindle-shaped cells containing two distinct classes of tightly packed secretory granules uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (A).\nRound-shaped mitochondria (mit) with disorganized cristae were frequently observed (A). Tumor cells containing large, pale-cored secretory granules (LG) were the majority with respect to cells containing small and dense-cored granules (SG). The tumor nodule also contained blood and connective tissue in which cancer cells were scattered. Consistently with other morphological studies [,], a morphometric analysis of granule size and distribution showed two main classes of secretory granules based on their size and morphology (B,C). The small granules (SG) had an electron-dense core and a size ranging from 200 to 400 nm, while the large granules (LG, 300\u2013500 nm in size) were pale-cored. Statistical significant differences in granules\u2019 size (*** p < 0.0001) and morphology might reflect distinct stages of hormonal production [,]. In particular, the mature granules appeared characterized by their uniform and moderate electron density and by their generalized distribution throughout the cytoplasm, while the small electron-dense granules would represent pre-secretory immature granules [].", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

{"clinical_note": "A 71 year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and acoustic neuroma was admitted for right retrosigmoid craniotomy and tumor resection. Her operation was uneventful, with no immediate post-surgical complications. She was discharged on dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 3 days, with tapering doses of steroids over the course of 1 week. Three weeks later, she presented to the hospital with persistent fever and chills, and had experienced occasional headaches for five days. On admission, her vitals were significant with a temperature of 38.5 \u00b0C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 158/83 mmHg. On examination, she was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her right posterior auricular incision site looked clean, with mild erythema but no discharge. Sutures were intact. Neurologic exam did not reveal any focal or meningeal signs. Laboratory studies were significant with a white blood cell count of 8.9 k/\u03bcL, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, and a platelet count of 313 k/\u03bcL. Urinalysis showed 33 white blood cells, positive leukocyte esterase, and negative nitrates. Urine culture grew more than 100,000 colonies of Klebsiella pneumoniae. She was started on cefepime 2 g intravenously every 12 h for presumptive urinary tract infection. Despite antibiotic coverage for 3 days, the patient continued to have fevers up to 38.7 \u00b0C. Given her recent surgical intervention, a computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered, which showed a subgaleal collection overlying the craniotomy site and hypodense areas in the right cerebellum that likely represented postoperative changes. A hypodense extra-axial collection was noted along the right cerebellum. Given the concern for postsurgical meningitis, cefepime was switched to meropenem 2 g every 8 h, and vancomycin 1 g every 12 h was added to her antibiotic regimen. The patient showed a rapid clinical deterioration, with the development of nuchal rigidity, altered mental status, and seizures in the next 24 h. She underwent a lumbar puncture, which evidenced an opening pressure of 30 cm H2O. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 800 white blood cells/mm3 with 90% neutrophils, low glucose (31 mg/dL), and high protein (115 mg/dL). The smear for acid-fast bacilli in CSF was negative. CSF Cryptococcus antigen was also negative. The FilmArray\u00ae meningitis/encephalitis panel did not identify any organisms. Emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered, which showed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and moderately dilated ventricles. Fluid layering within the bilateral occipital horns was noted, as there were concerns of ventriculitis. Additionally, a 1 cm right cerebellar extra-axial collection was seen (A,B). The patient was immediately taken to the operating room for the placement of an external ventricular drain. Intrathecal colistin and vancomycin were initiated afterwards. Follow-up CSF analysis 48 h later showed normalization of white blood cell count (2 cells/mm3); however, low glucose and high protein persisted. Lactic acid from CSF was elevated (35 mg/dL). Bacterial and fungal cultures from the blood and CSF did not show any growth. Intraventricular antibiotics were discontinued after 48 h, and the patient continued with meropenem and vancomycin intravenously for 2 weeks. Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient\u2019s mental status did not improve significantly, and the fevers continued intermittently. Further studies that included serum galactomannan and (1\u21923)-\u03b2-d-glucan were negative. A repeat MRI showed persistent leptomeningeal enhancement at the cervicomedullary junction at the skull. Extra-axial collection adjacent to the retrosigmoid craniotomy was again noted. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was ordered to rule out other potential sources of infection, but imaging was unremarkable. On further questioning, the patient\u2019s daughter stated that her mother was in India and Nepal three months prior to the initial craniotomy, where she was working as a volunteer in a clinic and was exposed to patients with tuberculosis (TB). The patient had a history of a positive purified protein derivative (PPD), but was never treated for latent TB. Given her epidemiologic risk factors, MRI findings and clinical deterioration, the patient was started on isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and levofloxacin for the treatment of presumptive tubercular meningitis. However, after one week of treatment, no clinical improvement was noted, and she was taken to the operating room for exploration. The patient underwent midline limited suboccipital craniotomy and C1 laminectomy. Clear pus was noted in the area of the foramen magnum, foramina of Magendie, and posterior to the upper cervical cord, with evidence of pachymeningitis of the pia of the upper cervical cord and both cerebellar tonsils. The subdural empyema was evacuated and samples were sent for cultures. A biopsy of the arachnoid tissue was obtained. Intra-operative frozen section revealed chronic mixed inflammatory, but no granulomas. Two days later, histopathology reported fungal elements. Immunohistochemistry for Aspergillus was strongly positive (A,B). Toxoplasma, acid-fast bacilli, and gram stains were negative. Tissue sample was sent to the University of Washington in Seattle, WA for fungal PCR. Anti-tuberculosis treatment was discontinued and the patient was started on liposomal amphotericin 5 mg/kg daily and voriconazole intravenously 6 mg/kg every 12 h as a loading dose, and then 4 mg/kg every 12 h for maintenance. Five days later, tissue real-time PCR came back positive for Aspergillus fumigatus. Amphotericin was discontinued and the patient was kept on voriconazole. The patient\u2019s mental status improved markedly over the following days. The fever subsided as well. Treatment with intravenous voriconazole was eventually transitioned to oral voriconazole 250 mg every 12 h to complete 3 months of therapy. The voriconazole level at 2 weeks of treatment was 2.6 \u03bcg/mL, which was within the therapeutic range for central nervous system (CNS) aspergillosis (reference range 2\u20135 \u03bcg/mL). The patient was later transferred to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy. At the four month follow-up, the patient was fully alert, and her verbal communication was almost back to her baseline. No focal or meningeal signs were noted on examination. A brain MRI was repeated and showed complete resolution of leptomeningeal enhancement, with no collections.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

{"clinical_note": "A 67-year-old man from India, who was recently diagnosed with latent tuberculosis, presented to an outside hospital and was admitted for six days with generalized fatigue and hypotension. On presentation, he reported a 2-week history of generalized fatigue with systolic blood pressures in the 60s, as recorded at home. He also reported a 30-pound weight loss which was attributed to diuretic use and dietary changes in the setting of congestive heart failure. With these complaints, his losartan (angiotensin receptor blocker) dose was reduced, which was ineffective in alleviating his symptoms. His history was notable for an LTBI diagnosed three months prior to presentation, for which he was being treated with INH (300 mg daily) and pyridoxine. He had been treated for 11 weeks by the time he presented, and was noted to tolerate the therapy well for at least four weeks without changes in dietary or sleeping habits, per documentation by his primary care provider. His medical history was otherwise notable for atrial fibrillation, beta thalassemia, and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. He had no known history of liver disease or diabetes. His other medications included apixiban, metoprolol, furosemide, losartan, and hydroxyzine (for insomnia). He had no prior history of heavy alcohol consumption or recreational drug use, and he worked in the electronics and computer industry. There was no family history of cirrhosis or other liver disease.\nHis initial workup was notable for elevated liver function tests, as shown in . A computed tomography scan of the abdomen demonstrated no intrahepatic biliary dilation and no apparent fatty change. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a simple cyst and heterogenous echotexture, with mild subcapsular nodularity. Based on his workup, his liver dysfunction was postulated to be drug-induced liver injury from INH or apixaban. Both medications were discontinued. He was discharged for outpatient management. However, follow-up laboratory testing indicated an increasing bilirubin, which resulted in readmission to the hospital. A liver biopsy was considered but not performed, as his bilirubin levels began to downtrend.\nOne week later, the patient experienced a syncopal episode while having a bowel movement, and was admitted to a different hospital. He presented with altered mental status and generalized pruritis. Laboratory data revealed worsening liver function () and acute kidney injury, for which he was treated with albumin, midodrine, and octreotide. His pruritis improved with the introduction of cholestyramine.\nAutoimmune serologies, including antinuclear antibody, antimitchondrial antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were negative. Viral hepatitis serologies were negative. HIV infection was ruled out. The patient\u2019s acetaminophen level, urine toxicology screen, and serum ferritin level were within normal limits. A transjugular liver biopsy was performed and demonstrated cholestatic hepatitis, thought to be drug- or toxin- related. His mental status initially improved with lactulose, but worsened thereafter, prompting a transfer to our hospital for consideration of liver transplantation for acute liver failure, about six weeks after initial presentation.\nPhysical examination at time of transfer was remarkable for jaundice, icteric sclera, and altered mental status. He was somnolent but arousable to noxious stimuli, oriented only to self, intermittently following some commands, and had notable asterixis. He had an irregular rhythm and a murmur on cardiac examination, vesicular breath sounds, and a benign abdominal examination. He was noted to have Grade III hepatic encephalopathy in the setting of acute liver failure, and was admitted to the intensive care unit before being listed for liver transplantation as Status 1A. On day four in the hospital, he underwent orthotopic liver transplant surgery, and was extubated on post-operative day one.

{"clinical_note": "In 2006, a 44-year-old woman developed a mass on the left breast with no other clinical symptoms. Excisional biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma. Modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer was then conducted. The postoperative pathological report indicated no evidence of residual cancer and no lymph node involvement (0 of 10). Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive expression of ER (approximately 60%) and PR (approximately 30%) but negative expression of human epidermal factor receptor 2 (HER2). The clinical stage was T1N0M0 (IA). Six cycles of cyclophosphamide + adriamycin + fluorouracil (CAF) chemotherapy were administered. Following CAF chemotherapy, the patient was given toremifene ET until the disease progressed (i.e., relapsed) in 2010.\nIn June 2010, a tumor was found in the right lower lobe of the lung during routine follow-up. A wedge excision biopsy was conducted, and the tumor was determined to be metastatic lung cancer secondary to breast cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis results were similar to those of the original primary tumor (ER+, approximately 70%; PR+, approximately 30%; and HER2+, 0%). After undergoing an ovariectomy, the patient began exemestane treatment to control the disease.\nIn March 2014, the patient complained of severe stimulating dry cough. Computed tomography (CT) identified metastases in the lungs and the mediastinal lymph nodes. Meanwhile, a left renal mass was found and was considered to be malignant. However, the patient did not complain of hematuria or flank pain and refused a biopsy to obtain a definite pathological diagnosis. From April 2014 onward, several chemotherapy regimens were employed sequentially to control the disease, but all eventually failed. These regimens included paclitaxel combined with capecitabine, vinorelbine combined with epirubicin, gemcitabine combined with cisplatin, and pemetrexed monotherapy. In August 2015, the patient's symptoms became more severe, and the patient presented with bloody phlegm. Multiple bone metastases were subsequently confirmed via single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).\nTo obtain real-time information about the tumor to inform subsequent treatment, a biopsy was recommended, and the patient consented. A CT-guided needle biopsy of the metastatic lesion in the left lung was performed. Lung metastasis of the breast cancer was confirmed (Fig. ). Interestingly, the immunohistochemical analysis showed increased expression of ER (approximately 90% +). On the basis of these findings, the patient began to take the selective ER downregulator (SERD) fulvestrant (500 mg) and zoledronic acid (4 mg) injections starting on August 19, 2015. Two months later, the subjective symptoms (i.e., dry cough and bloody phlegm) were markedly improved, and a partial response was achieved according to the RECIST criteria (Fig. ). Remarkably, the left renal mass also shrank, which confirmed the original metastatic diagnosis (Fig. ). No significant side effects were observed during the treatment administration of fulvestrant. The patient kept taking an intramuscular injection of fulvestrant (500 mg) every month until December 20, 2016, and CT results showed that the tumor had been stable for 16 months.\nThe patient decided to stop taking fulvestrant in late December 2016 and also refused to undergo any medical examination until the patient developed a severe cough in November 2017. Meanwhile, intracranial metastases were found by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient refused to participate in any clinical trials and decided on apatinib (250 mg/day), a vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGFR-TKI), as the main treatment.

He had smoked 60 cigarettes per day for 40 years and had been a heavy alcohol drinker for 40 years. For the last 9 years, he had had hypertension, and had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes over 1 year ago. He had no prior malignant disease or distant metastases.\nOn physical examination, the neck and supraclavicular lymph nodes were not palpable. No significant abnormal values were detected in the blood count or in serum and biochemical analysis. Iohexol swallowing revealed a malignant-appearing structure in the inferior-thoracic region. Endoscopic assessment revealed a lesion of mucosal hyperplasia forming a luminal stenosis 36 cm from the incisor teeth, which rendered it difficult for the gastroscope to pass through it. Biopsy of the lesion demonstrated an esophageal MEC. On computed tomography (CT) scanning, the tumor was deemed to be resectable (Fig. ). As the patient was found to be medically fit for an esophageal resection, this surgery was performed.\nEsophagectomy, 2-field (upper abdominal and mediastinum) lymphadenectomy, and esophagogastrostomy through the esophageal bed were performed on the tenth day of hospital admission. The resected esophagectomy specimen contained a fungating tumor that measured 45 and 40 mm in the longitudinal and cross-sectional dimensions.\nHistopathology showed that most tumor tissue was composed of epidermoid cells that were arranged in nests. In addition, keratin pearl formation was identified. Columnar mucus-secreting cells and intermediate cells in small areas that formed tube-like structures with invasive growth were confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining (Fig. ). Immunohistochemically, the tumor was found to be positive for p-63 (Fig. ), and CK5/6 (Fig. ), using the EnVision system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) to identify epidermoid cells. Mucus-secreting cells were identified using Periodic Acid-Schiff staining (Fig. ). Based on immunohistochemistry results, the tumor was diagnosed as a poorly differentiated esophageal MEC. According to the esophageal cancer TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system (American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union for Cancer Control staging system, 2010), the pathological stage was IIIb: T3N1bM0. The tumor dimensions were 45 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 15 mm. The tumor invaded the outer membrane of the esophagus. All resection margins were negative for tumor involvement, and 3 of 12 lymph nodes from the upper abdominal and mediastinum showed signs of lymphatic metastasis.\nOne month after surgery, radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel and cisplatin was provided. Four additional cycles of chemotherapy were administered; the regimen consisted of paclitaxel (200 mg/m2 on day 1 for 3 hours) plus cisplatin (30 mg/m2 per day for 3 days) repeated for 3 weeks. On the last day of the first chemotherapy cycle, radiotherapy against large chest irregular area, including the entire esophageal bed and the mediastina, was provided to the patient, beginning 30 minutes after the end of cisplatin infusion. The total dose for 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) was 50.4 Gy/28 fractions, and for 95% of the PTV for involved lymph nodes (PTVnd) was 56 Gy/28 fractions. No significant complications occurred after administration of adjuvant radio-chemotherapy. The patient was followed up with no evidence of recurrence for 17 months after surgery.\nSeventeen months after surgery, an esophageal CT scan revealed that the esophageal wall was evenly thickened (Fig. ). However, endoscopic assessment revealed no evidence of recurrence. Further esophageal CT scans at 19 and 31 months postsurgery also showed a thickened esophageal wall (Fig. ); however, endoscopic assessment still revealed no esophageal stricture and no evidence of recurrence at 31 months after surgery.

After being treated with amiodarone for a year, his electrocardiogram (ECG) remained abnormal. Then, he was transferred to the cardiovascular department of our hospital. He had no symptoms such as chest congestion, dizziness, or fatigue, nor did he exhibit symptoms of metabolic syndromes as tachycardia, trembling, or hyperhidrosis. Radiofrequency ablation was performed to treat his AF. The ECG recovered, but the laboratory tests showed TSH 8.9 mU/L (RR, 0.27\u20134.2), FT3 6.61 pmol/L (RR, 3.6\u20137.5), and FT4 33.47 pmol/L (RR, 12\u201322). He ignored the suggestion to consult an endocrinologist. Three months later, the AF recurred, so he received radiofrequency ablation again. Nine months after the patient was discharged from the cardiovascular department, he was referred to our outpatient division for tachycardia, tremors, and thermophobia. At that time, the hormonal examination implied thyrotoxicosis, with a positive result for the TSH receptor antibody (FT3 34.34 pmol/L, FT4 > 100 pmol/L, TSH 0.755 mU/L, TRAb 15.28 IU/L). After administration of thyrozol 10 mg twice a day for 4 months, his symptoms resolved, and his thyroid hormone levels returned to within normal ranges; however, his TSH level was markedly increased. It was suggested to the patient that he should consult an endocrinologist for further examination of the inappropriate secretion of TSH due to central hyperthyroidism. On physical examination at admission, the patient was 172.0 cm tall and weighed 73 kg (body mass index, 24.7 kg/m2). His blood pressure was 135/80 mm Hg, and his pulse was 75 beats/min. The thyroid gland was diffusely enlarged, and ultrasonography of the thyroid revealed a rich vascular supply with a nodule located in the left lobe. Fine needle inspiration biopsy suggested the nodule was benign. The computer perimetry suggested a defective visual field.

Based on these data, we diagnosed the patient with TSH-producing pituitary macroadenoma and central hyperthyroidism. One week after diagnosis, in May 2014, total resection of the pituitary macroadenoma was performed through transsphenoidal neurosurgery. Upon immunohistochemical examination, the resected pituitary adenoma cells exhibited positive staining with the TSH and PRL antibodies, and the percentage of positive Ki-67 was less than 2%, suggesting that the tumor was benign (Fig. ). After surgery, his TSH levels and thyroid hormone levels remained within the normal ranges. His serum thyroid hormone levels increased beyond the normal ranges 1 year later (TSH 0.223, FT3 11.56, FT4 36.36), although no residual tumor was apparent on the MRI. Positive results were obtained for TRAb, and both TgAb and TPOAb were elevated beyond their normal ranges (TRAb 5.62 IU/L, TgAb 32.79 IU/L, TPOAb 14.13 IU/L). The patient was administered thyrozol 10 mg/day, and his thyroid function tests remained clinically acceptable during 3 years of follow-up. Repeated pituitary MRIs showed a possible mass in the pituitary, suggesting tumor recurrence. In addition, recent ultrasonography showed that the thyroid nodule remained the same size.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 66-year-old man with a history of left knee osteoarthritis and varus deformity was scheduled to undergo TKA at our hospital. The left lower extremity was prepped using a topical solution, which was to disinfect skin 2 times with chlorhexidine alcohol skin disinfectant (mainly consist of 4.5 g/L chlorhexidine acetate and 70% alcohol). Let the skin air dry, and then place the iodophor-impregnated antimicrobial incise drape on the operation area, which included application of an iodophor-impregnated antimicrobial incise drape. Draping was performed using standard aseptic procedure.\nSubsequently, surgery was performed using conventional surgical procedures. At the end of the operation, the skin incision was sterilized again and sutured. Upon removal of the adhesive drape by delicate peeling and warm saline lavage, a large area of the skin avulsion happened. The extensive punctate hemorrhage was visible (Fig. ). The skin avulsion was in the posterior part of the patient's left crus. The avulsion area was approximately 6.5 \u00d7 30 cm.\nPetrolatum gauze was used to dress the areas of epidermal avulsion. Routine postsurgical dressing (gauze, cotton pad, and bandage) was applied to the incision. On postoperative day 2, an initial dressing change was performed. We consulted with doctors from other relevant departments regarding the avulsion injury who advised on the applicable treatment measures. Based on these measures, we asked the patient to raise the affected leg and keep the wound dry. Sulfadiazine cream was applied to the area of epidermal avulsion. Dressing changes were performed daily. On postoperative day 3, oral cefixime therapy of 100 mg bid was initiated as part of the anti-infection treatment. On postoperative day 4, the light yellow liquid exudes and the localized inflammatory response was visible (Fig. ). On postoperative day 7, the exudate decreased and the inflammatory response was reduced. There was no evidence of infection (Fig. ). On postoperative week 2, the wound was dry, and there was no exudate and no obvious inflammatory reaction (Fig. ). The patient was discharged from hospital on postoperative 2 weeks and was required to change the dressing every 3 days until the avulsion area was dry.

{"clinical_note": "An 82-year-old male patient was originally admitted to the hospital for difficulty in urinating spontaneously on November 24, 2014. The patient was diagnosed with prostatic adenocarcinoma after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and postoperative pathological examination (Fig. ). In addition, a SPECT/CT scan revealed multiple bone metastases (Fig. ). Initial PSA and free PSA (FPSA) levels were 54.54 and 2.63 \u03bcg/mL, respectively (Fig. A). The patient exhibited poor tolerance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, possibly due to advanced age or pacemaker implantation; therefore, immune therapy of alloreactive CTL was selected as a treatment option.\nThe patient received the first two cycles of ACTL treatment from December 16, 2014 to February 10, 2015. His PSA levels significantly decreased from 54.54 to 1.35 \u03bcg/mL after 28 cycles of continuous ACTL immunotherapy, to undetectable levels of <0.003 \u03bcg/mL on May 12, 2016; similarly, immediately after completion of ACTL therapy the FPSA levels were down from 2.63 \u03bcg/mL to undetectable levels of <0.01 \u03bcg/mL. The PSA and FPSA level remained stable in subsequent days. All the changes in PSA and FPSA are plotted in Fig. B, and each test was performed in the same laboratory. Importantly, there were few bone metastatic lesions detected by the SPECT/CT scan in December 2016 (Fig. ). Similarly, no metastatic lesions were detected in other organs, including the lung, liver, and the brain, by the PET-CT scan. Importantly, the patient remains alive after receiving 2 years of immunotherapy, despite being initially diagnosed with metastatic lesions at multiple sites of the body (Fig. ). Conversely, the withdraw of the ACTL immunotherapy was accompanied by a gradual increase in PSA levels in the patient from being undetectable (<0.003 \u03bcg/mL) on May 12, 2016 to 1.08 \u03bcg/mL on April 6, 2017 (Fig. ). Unfortunately, the ACTL immunotherapy was not applied again because of the expensive cost and lack of proper blood supply.\nIt is worth noting that there was no apparent cardiovascular system-related symptom or graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) detected in the patient over the course of the immunotherapy treatment, despite the patient being diagnosed with high blood pressure and Type II diabetes at the beginning the administering immunotherapy.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 72-year-old man who was followed up for persistent pain in the left side of the waist for 2 years, radiating to the left hip. The history of schistosomiasis was 40 years, and with hypertension 1 year. On physical examination, he had pain on movement of the spine with bilateral Grade IV motor strength in both lower extremities. There was not numbness in both feet and ankles with normal ankle reflexes bilaterally. There was a normal knee reflex bilaterally. There was no obvious bulge in the bilateral kidney region, and the left lateral kidney region knocks out to be positive for pain. The neurological symptoms were ascribed to the compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots by an expanding mass partly protruding into the vertebral canal.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed that the left side of the vertebral body and the left peritoneum showed an elliptical abnormal signal shadow, which showed a dumbbell growth. The MRI scan showed an area of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the T12-L4 paravertebral region. At discovery, on the left side of the L1 vertebral body, there was a slightly longer T1/T2 signal, with a size of 8.6 \u00d7 8.4 \u00d7 12.4 cm (Fig. ). The boundary was clear, and the enhanced scan showed an uneven separation. The lesion protruding into the erector spinae muscles and behind the retroperitoneum are connected to the lesion in the vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramen, and the spinal cord was compressed and the boundary was clear. And the computed tomography (CT) showed that bone destruction can be seen on left lateral transverse process of L2, and the left kidney was significantly compressed (Fig. ).\nThe patient was treated with surgical resection of the total tumor, followed by the spinal internal fixation of L1 to L2 with pedicle screws. A posterior approach was selected for decompression. Intraoperatively, 2 lumps measuring 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 cm and 8 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 3 cm were visible in the focal region. They were well circumscribed and completely resected (Fig. ). Total laminectomy was performed for L1 and L2. On histopathological examination, the gross specimen consisted of ragged pieces of pale-tan, slightly gelatinous material admixed with blood clot. Microscopic examination of the formalin fixed paraffin-embedded specimen showed the presence of a lobulated neoplasm in a prominent extracellular myxoid matrix. The neoplastic cells were composed of syncytial cords of \u201cphysaliphorous cells\u201d that contained abundant pale septated and vacuolated clear to bubbly cytoplasm with mild nuclear pleomorphism. Overt mitosis was not identified. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the lesional cells were positive to CK(+++), S100(++), CD65(+), neuron-specific enolase(++), epithelial membrane antigen (+++), and vimentin(+++). The coexpression of epithelial and mesenchymal immunohistochemical markers supported the notochordal lineage of the lesional cells. Ki67 was 3%+ in the lesional cells. The above histomorphological features in conjunction with the immune-phenotype observed confirmed the diagnosis of chordoma.\nNo heavy ion radiotherapy was performed because the tumor massively invaded into spinal canal and foramen, compressing the spinal cord and nerve root directly. After 5-month follow-up, we find the recurrence in the original lesion through the post-operative CT (Fig. ). In consideration of the huge and complex recurrence, we did not have second operation. At the 15-month follow-up, the patient was dead after a lot of times revisit by various doctors.", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "The 33-year-old right-handed male patient, with no history of brain damage had suffered from a stroke. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an infarction lesion in the left frontal lobe, insula, and basal ganglia (Fig. A). 14 months after stroke, the patient had aphasia only without limb paralysis; thus, he received a 5-month speech therapy composed of spontaneous speech, auditory comprehension, repetition, naming, writing, reading training, and calculation. The speech therapy was carried out for 1 hour per session, for twice a day and 5 days a week. Moreover, the Aphasia Battery of Chinese (ABC) and Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) were used to evaluate the language function and the severity of aphasia before and after the speech therapy. Briefly, ABC is a modified Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) adapted to the Chinese culture, which is currently the most extensively used scale in China for aphasia assessment, with well-established reliability and validity.[ Informed consent was given and the experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of Jinan University First Affiliated Hospital in Guangzhou, China.\nThe results suggested that the patient had attained certain improvements in his language function (spontaneous speech: 69.8 percentile, auditory comprehension: 66.4 percentile, repetition: 64.0 percentile, and naming: 84.8 percentile). Besides, the severity of aphasia was rated at level 2 before the speech therapy. After the speech therapy, further language functional improvements were achieved (spontaneous speech: 81.1 percentile, auditory comprehension: 69.4 percentile, repetition: 72.0 percentile, and naming: 84.8 percentile), and the severity of aphasia was rated at level 3.\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was carried out before and after the speech therapy, respectively. In addition, an 8-channel head coil equipped on a 3.0 T American GE Discovery 750 MRI with single shot echo-planar imaging was used for the acquisition of DTI data. A total of 47 contiguous slices parallel to the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure line was acquired for each of the 25 noncollinear diffusion sensitizing gradients. Specifically, the imaging parameters were as follows: TR/TE = 5000 ms/68.0 ms, acquisition matrix = 96 \u00d7 96, reconstructed to matrix = 128 \u00d7 128 matrix, field of view = 25.6 \u00d7 25.6 mm2, b = 1000 s / mm2, NEX = 1, slice thickness/slice spacing = 3 mm/0 mm. It took 135 seconds for DTI data acquisition. Besides, the corpus callosum was tracked using the self-prepared software package (Functool 9.4.05a). Fiber tracking was initiated at the center of a seed voxel with a fractional anisotropy (FA) of >0.18, apparent diffusion coefficient of >0.01, and the maximum steps of 160.\nResults of the follow-up DTI fiber tracking demonstrated that the fiber pathway between the splenium of corpus callosum and the left superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) had been established. In addition, the fiber connections between the genu of corpus callosum and the right inferior frontal gyrus (the mirror region of Broca's area) were increased (Fig. B).", "topic_list": "['underlying processes/pathways', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'interprets laboratory or other study findings', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 61-year-old man who presented with progressive abdominal distention for 8 days was admitted to a local hospital on Feb 23, 2014. Gastroscopic examination and biopsy specimens were evaluated in the local hospital. Histopathological findings showed a suspected diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma in the body of the stomach.\nOn Feb 27, 2014, the patient was transferred to our hospital for further management strategy. Physical examination showed that right upper quadrant pain and tenderness were present and no peristaltic waves. The rest of the physical was unremarkable. A detailed medical history was obtained. The patient lost weight of 3 kg in recent 1 month. He had been previously admitted to the hospital for active tuberculosis 5 years ago and finally recovered completely. No history of diabetes, coronary artery diseases, hypertension, hepatitis, drug allergy, previous trauma, or operation was demonstrated. Laboratory tests revealed the following: red blood cell (RBC) count, 4.18 \u00d7 1012/L (normal range, 3.68\u20135.13 \u00d7 1012/L); hemoglobin concentration, 137 g/L (normal range, 114\u2013151 g/L); white blood cell (WBC) count, 11.5 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, 4\u201310 \u00d7 1012/L); platelet count, 289 \u00d7 109/L (normal range, 100\u2013300 \u00d7 109/L). Tumor markers were detected as the following: \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), 3.60 ng/mL (normal range, 0\u201315 ng/mL); carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 1.26 ng/mL (normal range, 0\u20135 ng/mL); carcinoma antigen (CA) 19-9, 5.6 U/mL (normal range, 50.1\u201327 U/mL). A chest x-ray showed bilaterally patchy infiltrates, increased bronchovascular markings and mass in the right lower lung fields (Fig. A), which needed further computerized tomography (CT) detection suggested by radiologists. A plain x-ray of the abdomen showed the gaseous distention of the bowel with air-fluid levels (Fig. B). Abdominal gaseous echoes were detected by ultrasonography. CT scans of the chest showed bilateral upper-lobe with patchy infiltrates, focal calcification and nodular opacities peripherally with cavitation, which indicated the changes of post-primary pulmonary tuberculosis (Fig. A); CT scans of the abdomen showed air-fluid levels in loops of small bowel, which indicated that mechanical obstruction was a likely diagnosis (Fig. B). Pathologic consultation of gastroscopic biopsy specimens in our hospital confirmed the diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma. Given the rarity of gastric squamous-cell carcinoma, pathologists suggested that further examination was needed to find the primary tumor. An enhanced CT scan was performed in this condition and the results were shown that the enhancement of right lower lung fields was not evident, which implied lung sclerosis after tuberculosis (Fig. ).\nOn March 5, 2014, the suddenly occurred abdominal pain was persistent and severe. The diagnosis of acute abdomen was made and urgent surgery was needed. The patient underwent a laparotomy with curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer and small bowel partial resection. Intraoperatively, a mass with a diameter of 0.8 cm was palpable in the greater curvature of the stomach and there was no significant lymphadenopathy (Fig. A, B). In addition, a mass with a diameter of 3 cm was found in the small bowel at the distance of approximately 30 cm to ileocecal area and the bowel became completely obstructed (Fig. C, D). Postoperative histopathology confirmed a moderately-differentiated squamous-cell carcinoma with full-thickness infiltration and vessel invasion in stomach (Fig. A, B) and small bowl (Fig. C, D). The margins of resection were free of tumor in the specimens and no regional lymph node metastasis was found in perigastric and perienteric area. In view of the rareness of gastrointestinal multiple primary squamous-cell carcinoma, further research was recommended by pathologists to exclude the metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma from the lung or the esophagus.\nEsophageal mass or lesion was not found on endoscopic examination and the metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma from the esophagus was excluded. It was important to attempt to isolate the tumor cells from the sputum and to carry out a lung biopsy. In the fifth examination of stained smears of sputum, squamous-cells with properties of tumor cells were found. Meanwhile, transbronchial aspirates were obtained with a 19-gauge flexible histology needle by using a CT scan as a guide and squamous-cell lung cancer was confirmed (Fig. A, B).\nThe diagnosis of lung squamous-cell carcinoma with multiple metastases to the stomach and small bowl was confirmed. As the tumor was not resectable, surgeons recommended conservative treatments. The patient was recommended with combination chemotherapy of carboplatin and paclitaxel for 3 cycles.

By the time of admission, she had had abdominal pain, nausea, and lack of appetite for over a month. The family called an emergency ambulance but twice did not allow the patient to be taken to hospital. Because of her deteriorating condition, which was showing no improvement with oral amoxicillin with clavulanic acid 3 times a day (0.625 g), she was referred to our department to improve her poor condition. She had undergone appendectomy in her forties and hip bone fracture in 2013. She had not been administered any drugs so far.\nClinical examination revealed full mental conscious, dehydration, pulse rate of 90 beats/min, blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, a body temperature of 39.5\u00b0C, left-side alignment of the alveolar murmur at the base of the left lung, local tenderness in the right upper abdomen without muscular defense. Her initial laboratory measurements showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 17.77 \u00d7 109/L (norm: 4 \u00d7 109\u201310 \u00d7 109/L), with 86.8% neutrophils, hemoglobin at 6.80 mmol/L (norm: 7.45\u201310.00 mmol/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 86 mm (norm: 3\u201315 mm), and C-reactive protein level was 177.00 mg/L (norm: 0.00\u20135.00 mg/L). AUS showed gallbladder enlargement with stones and widening of the common bile duct (CBD) to 16 mm. The patient was consulted by the surgeon who, due to the high risk of mortality, decided to carry out intravenous antimicrobial therapy with ciprofloxacin 2 times a day with a dose of 0.4 g, metronidazole 2 times a day with a dose of 0.5 g, intravenous rehydration and alimentation, and spasmolytic drugs. We observed a mild improvement in the patient's condition with a decrease of body temperature to 36.8\u00b0C.

CT of the abdomen revealed gallbladder stones with a widening of the CBD to 13 mm and widening of the Virsung duct to 8 mm, as well as some small pancreatic cysts with a pancreas tumor of 38 mm in diameter. CT also revealed aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, left suprarenal tumor, and esophagus hernia that had not been previously diagnosed. Abdominal MRI confirmed calculous cholecystitis and pancreatitis, probably with inflammatory tumor of the pancreas. After multidisciplinary consultation, we decided to treat the patient with meropenem intravenously three times a day at a dose of 1.0 g. The patient did not consent to undergo surgery. Over the next few days, the patient's health significantly improved, and after three weeks of hospitalization she was discharged home, with neither fever nor abdominal pain. She received restricted dietary recommendations. After discharge, the patient further gradually regained her physical health and returned to the condition she had presented before the disease.

Case history revealed that she had not attended any check-ups during her pregnancy. The physical examination showed a 60% to 70% effaced and 3-cm dilated cervix, the fetus had cephalic presentation, and amniotic membranes were intact. Fetal ultrasound showed an isolated anechoic hepatic cyst measuring 1.32/1.47 cm. The cyst was situated in the right anterior abdominal compartment between the gallbladder and the umbilical vein, and at that time it was not certain if the cyst was located in parenchyma or choledocal. Because of the position of the cyst, close to fetal abdominal wall, we suspected that it was a parenchymal cyst (Fig. ).\nColor Doppler flow imaging did not show any flow in the cystic mass and showed that it was situated to the right of the umbilical vein (Fig. ).\nA female fetus was vaginally delivered in cephalic presentation shortly after her mother was admitted. The weight at birth was 2440 g, and the newborn was diagnosed with low weight for gestational age. The Apgar score value was 8 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes.

In the recent 8 months, she experienced severely impairing and dizzines s and anemia. The blood test revealed normocytic anemia and she was admitted to the local hospital. Laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell (WBC) count, 5.48 \u00d7 109 cells/L; hemoglobin (Hb) count, 34 g/L; erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 89.0 fl, platelet (PLT) count, 381 \u00d7 109 cells/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 138 mm/h; CRP, 117 mg/L; rheumatoid factor, 223 IU/mL; anti-cyclic peptide containing citrulline, 885.6 RU/mL; anti-nuclear antibody/anti-phospholipid antibodies/anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, negative; vitamin B12, 368 pmol/L; folic acid, 4.6 nmol/L; erythropoietin, normal; serum ferritin, 287.96 ng/mL. At this point, MTX was discontinued and the patient received red blood cell transfusions. After treatment with glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 4 mg/TID for 12 weeks), joint symptoms and CRP/ESR improved. However, the patient's hemoglobin level declined to 32 g/L. Even though folic acid tablets and ferrous sulfate were also administered, the response remained poor. The patient was referred to our hospital. Re-examination was conducted after red blood cell transfusion with the following laboratory data: WBC, 2.3 \u00d7 109 cells/L; Hb, 49 g/L; PLT, 237 \u00d7 109 cells/L; ESR, 108 mm/h; CRP, 61 mg/L; ferritin, 2325 g/L; and IL-6, 214.24 pg/mL.\nThe examination of bone marrow aspiration demonstrated dysplastic features on 2 hematopoietic lineages, but more prominent in the erythroid, which showed clustering with nuclear budding, pedal nuclei, and H-J bodies (dysplasis >10%). The double nuclei and megaloblastic changes could also be observed in the granulocytic lineage (accounting for 4%). The number of megakaryocytes was increased and the production of thrombocytes was fine (Fig. ). In addition, bone marrow biopsy also revealed hypercellularity and erythroid hyperplasia. Cytogenetic analysis showed a normal 46 XX [20] karyotype.\nCombining her medical history with the clinical and laboratory parameters, a diagnosis of treatment-related MDS (t-MDS) was made. Disease modifying antirheumatic drug (MTX) might have been responsible for the bone marrow toxicity.\nThese results, in combination with the patient's history, led to the addition of tocilizumab to the treatment regimen. To evaluate the clinical effects of tocilizumab in the RA patient, WBC, Hb, ferritin, ESR/CRP, and IL-6 were assessed at baseline, 1st, 3rd, and 6th months of tocilizumab treatment. She started therapy with intravenous injection of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) every 4 weeks and oral corticosteroids (15 mg/QD), achieving clinical benefit and improvement in symptoms. One month after admission, the patient was discharged from hospital. Laboratory results at that time were: WBC, 8.6 \u00d7 109 cells/L; Hb, 97 g/L; CRP, 7.2 mg/L; ESR, 26 mm/h; ferritin, 936 g/L; and IL-6, 23.85 pg/mL. Upon hospital admission, 2 months after the regular checkup, the results were: WBC, 6.9 \u00d7 109 cells/L; Hb, 73 g/L; CRP, 41 mg/L; ESR, 38 mm/h; ferritin, 231 g/L; and IL-6, 1.12 pg/mL. Repeat bone marrow aspiration at the 6-month follow-up showed that dysplasia was not obvious. Laboratory results showed no obvious abnormality. This resulted in the prompt resolution of the patient's serological, physical, and pathological abnormalities. Hence, the response to tocilizumab treatment was very good.\nHowever, it was shown to be unlikely that the use of low doses of steroids in the patient was responsible for the sustained disease control. The patient refused the injection of tocilizumab after the 6th month. CRP (92.6 mg/L) increased and joint pain returned. Despite this relapse, the patient's laboratory examination was stable and symptoms significantly improved after resuming treatment with tocilizumab (Fig. ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Histopathology of the lymph nodes extracted by exploratory laparotomy revealed granulamatous lymphadenitis with granulomas including giant cells, mostly suspecting TB (). Ankylosing spondylitis was also diagnosed. Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index score was 1.0, disease activity was low. Patient was put on ATT consisting of (2HREZ/7HR) regimen as isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide at therapeutic doses for initial 2 months followed by rifampicin and isoniazide in the same doses for the last 7 months. At the 6th week of treatment, he gained weight about 6 kg and he was feeling healthy. Hemoglobin was 12.6 gm/dL. We performed follow-up F-18 FDG PET/ CT.

{"clinical_note": "This is not a clinical study. Therefore, ethic approval is not needed. Father of the patient provided the written informed consent.\nA 19-year-old man presented with polydipsia and polyuria with muscle weakness for more than 1 month. His urine output was approximately 4 to 7 L/d. He later developed vomiting and paralysis. He was admitted to a local hospital and was hospitalized with severe hypokalemia (1.9 mmol/L) and metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22, pCO2 26.0 mm Hg, HCO3 10.6 mmol/L, lactate 7.1 mmol/L, base excess \u221215.6 mmol/L). The patient recovered from paralysis on the third hospital day with serum potassium level 3.1 mmol/L and normal blood gas results after appropriate therapy. He presented to our hospital for further evaluation. Physical examination was only significant for pallor. He did not have a family or personal history of neuromuscular, thyroid, or autoimmune disease.\nAt the time of admission, laboratory evaluation revealed the following abnormalities: white blood count 3.16 \u00d7 109/L, hemoglobin 74 g/L, and platelet count 128 \u00d7 109/L. Serum chemistry showed: sodium 140 mmol/L, chloride 108 mmol/L, potassium 3.18 mmol/L, calcium 1.89 mmol/L, creatinine 57.8 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 19 mmol/L. Urinary pH was 6.5, with sodium 80 mmol/L and potassium 18.68 mmol/L; chloride, calcium, and creatinine were normal. A 24-hour urine test started on the day of admission revealed the following: sodium 320 mmol/24 h, potassium 74.7 mmol/24 h, calcium 12.24 mmol/24 h, and protein 988.00 mg/24 h. Serum and urinary osmolality were 303 and 158 mOsm/kg, respectively. Growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1, thyroid hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, plasma aldosterone, renin activity, antinuclear antibody, and anti-Smith antibody were within reference range. Other chemistries and coagulation parameters were in normal range.\nBrain magnetic resonance imaging showed an abnormal pituitary gland, and he had an insignificant response to a water deprivation test after vasopressin injection. The findings suggested NDI. With overt acidosis (plasma bicarbonate <20 mmol/L) and urinary pH > 6.0, we confirmed the coexistence of renal tubular acidosis. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed symmetrical homogeneous kidneys with hyperechogenic pattern and poor corticomedullary differentiation (Fig. ). Because of the hematologic abnormalities, bone marrow aspiration was performed and revealed 39% blast cells. The immunophenotypic analysis showed blast cells positive for CD34+, CD38+, CD10+, CD19+, CD22+, cyCD22+, CD79+, HLA-DR+, and TdT+. Cytogenetics showed normal male karyotype. Cerebrospinal cytology was negative. He was diagnosed with precursor B-cell ALL with acquired NDI. Leukemic infiltration of the kidneys may have led to polydipsia and polyuria.\nThis patient had an excellent response to standardized combination chemotherapy and achieved complete remission (CR) at the end of induction. His polydipsia and polyuria improved considerably after 3 days of chemotherapy. He refused the best therapy of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) at that time. Unfortunately, leukemia relapsed after sustained remission for 1 year. As a human leukocyte antigen-matched related or appropriate unrelated donor was not available, haplo-SCT was an alternative. He received haplo-SCT from his father after a second CR. Unfortunately, 20% blast cells were found in bone marrow 6 months after haplo-SCT. Next, a graft-versus-leukemia effect was successfully induced with the intervention of donor lymphocyte infusion, which achieved sustained remission. At 1 year after haplo-SCT, the patient developed a fungal pulmonary infection and was found to have bilateral renal enlargement with low density on abdominal computed tomography (Fig. ). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed symmetrical homogeneous kidneys with a hyperechogenic pattern and poor corticomedullary differentiation. The left kidney measured 17.1 cm \u00d7 9.6 cm, and the right kidney measured 16.9 cm \u00d7 9.7 cm. He returned 9 days later with muscle weakness, paralysis, polydipsia, and polyuria.

The girl had experienced high fever for 3 weeks, irritability for 2 weeks, and refusal to walk for 1 week. Three weeks before admission to PUMCH, she was seen at a local clinic (Haikou City, Hainan Island, located in the southern end of China) for fever and constipation. Physical examination was normal, and she was treated with ibuprofen. One week later, she presented to Haikou People's Hospital with a persistent high fever of over 39.5\u00b0C, irritability, and crying during the night. The result of head computer tomography scan was normal, and lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 140 mm H2O. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and had 120 \u00d7 106/L white blood cells with 38% neutrophils and 62% lymphocytes. The patient was treated for viral meningitis with an antiviral for 2 weeks. Thereafter, she refused to walk because of lower limb pain. The patient's fever was not relieved by treatment.\nThis girl was gravida 1 para 1 and was the full-term baby of an uncomplicated pregnancy. She had been raised in the countryside of Hainan Island. She had normal developmental milestones, uneventful previous history, and full immunization for her age.\nThe patient cried and was extremely irritable during the physical examination. The physical examination showed that she had a weight of 11.5 kg and a temperature of 40\u00b0C. Rashes, lymphadenectasis, and joint redness were not observed. Skin sensation could not be evaluated because the patient responded to any skin contact with exaggeration and crying. The patient's muscle strength and tone were normal even though she refused to stand or walk. The jerk reflexes of her limbs were symmetrical, and her pathological reflex was negative. No obvious focal neurologic signs were detected.\nLaboratory tests showed a peripheral blood leukocyte count of 12.6 \u00d7 109/L with an increased eosinophil count of 21.3% and absolute eosinophil count of 2.69 \u00d7 109/L. The results of renal and liver function tests and routine urine and stool tests were normal. Serum IgM antibodies to cytomegalovirus, herpes virus simplex, and Epstein-Barr virus were negative.\nThe magnetic resonance image of her brain was normal. Lumbar puncture disclosed an opening pressure of 200 mm H2O, and the CSF appeared cloudy. CSF cytology showed a white blood cell count of 400 \u00d7 106/L with 70% eosinophils, 32% monocytes, and 3% lymphocytes (Fig. ). The chemistry test results of the patient's CSF showed 2.2 mmol/L glucose, 122 mmol/L chloride, and 600 mg/dL total protein. The Gram stain, India ink stain, and the acid-fast stain results of the CSF were negative. CSF aerobic and anaerobic cultures and cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and fungi were all negative.\nParasitic eosinophilic meningitis was highly suspected because of the patient's increased blood and CSF eosinophil count and persistent neurological symptoms. The mother was further questioned for the infant's exposure history. She recalled seeing the child play with slugs.\nEosinophilic meningitis was diagnosed clinically on the basis of the child's exposure history, and parasite-specific investigations were initiated. The suspected third-stage larvae of A cantonensis were found in the CSF. However, a reference laboratory in Beijing Tropical Medical Research Center reported that the patient's serum sample tested negative for antibodies against A cantonensis.\nConsidering the patient's clinical symptoms and signs, increased intracranial pressure and eosinophil levels in peripheral and CSF samples, and lack of response to antiviral treatment, as well as the presence of parasites in CSF, oral empiric treatment with 2.5 mg/(kg/day) levamisole and 1.5 mg/(kg/day) prednisone together with mannose was initiated to reduce intracranial pressure.\nThe patient exhibited rapid recovery, and all of her symptoms resolved approximately 72 hours after the commencement of treatment. Hematological testing and CSF examination revealed that the child's eosinophil count had decreased. Thus, prednisone dosage was gradually decreased. Another lumbar puncture performed 4 weeks after the first lumbar puncture revealed that the eosinophil levels in the child's CSF had decreased to 0. The patient was discharged from the hospital and completed 4 weeks of treatment with levamisole and prednisolone.

There was no fever and no symptoms of cough or breathing difficulties.\nThe patient had no significant medical history and immunisations were up to date. On examination, she was apyrexial with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, oxygen saturations of 99% on room air and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. She was warm and well perfused with a central capillary refill time of <2 seconds. She appeared distressed when laying down reporting worsening pain; however, the abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation. Systemic examination was otherwise unremarkable.\nUrine analysis showed no evidence of infection and blood tests revealed a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 23 mg/L and a normal full blood count with white cells of 13.4 \u00d7 109 cells/L. Liver function tests, urea and electrolytes, and venous blood gas were also normal.\nWith normal observations, examination and investigation results and a good response to analgesia in the department, the patient was discharged with a planned review.\nOn re-assessment the following day, she continued to complain of significant pain on the right side of the abdomen with similar features on examination. Owing to the persistence of symptoms, chest radiography (Fig. ) and abdominal ultrasound were performed. Both were reported as normal. With no surgical or medical cause of the pain identified, it was deemed musculoskeletal in origin, associated with playing netball. She was discharged with advice to take regular analgesia and to return if symptoms were not settling.\nThe patient represented the following day looking unwell. She appeared very pale with dry lips and walked slowly, hunched over. She was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute and tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturations, temperature, and blood pressure were normal at 98%, 36.80C, and 119/72 mmHg respectively.

Musculoskeletal examination of the spine, hips, and knees was unremarkable, but it was noted that abdominal pain worsened on flexion of the hip against resistance. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were normal. She was unable to lie supine because of severe pain and was examined in the semirecumbent position. Active distension of the abdomen and coughing further exacerbated the pain and she was found to have guarding with rebound tenderness in the right flank and hypochondrium. An intravenous cannula was inserted and intravenous fluids, paracetamol, and ibuprofen were commenced while awaiting a surgical review for her acute abdomen. Concurrent orthopedic opinion was also sought because of the new-onset scoliosis.\nAfter treatment the patients\u2019 pain was significantly reduced, pallor had resolved and her observations normalised. Abdominal examination at the time of surgical review was normal, but because of repeated presentations with abdominal pain and a rising CRP (93 mg/L) and white cell count (13.9 \u00d7 109 cells/L) the patient was admitted and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was arranged. Orthopedic review did not yield any acute orthopedic concerns regarding the scoliosis and they agreed with the plan for abdominal imaging. The CT scan failed to reveal an abdominal cause for her pain, but to our surprise showed an organizing right lower lobe pneumonia with a small effusion (Figs. and ).\nThe patient was started on intravenous antibiotics for the thus far silent pneumonia. Despite treatment during the next few days, the pneumonia progressed and she developed a large parapneumonic effusion (Figs. and ). On the 6th day of hospital admission, she deteriorated rapidly with signs of sepsis and respiratory distress. This was accompanied by a further rise in CRP (351 mg/L) and white cell count (17.3 \u00d7 109 cells/L). She was stabilized and then transferred to a tertiary hospital for further management.\nAt the tertiary center, a chest drain was inserted and the patient was treated with intrapleural urokinase therapy and intravenous antibiotics.

Pain relived only partially with salicylates and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. He had no other musculoskeletal complaints or any other significant past medical history. He had previously sought consultation in other places and various diagnoses such as lateral epicondylitis, mono-articular rheumatoid involvement.\nPhysical examination revealed no swelling or fullness around the elbow. There was mild tenderness along the anterior aspect of elbow. There was restriction of both flexion and extension with elbow range of motion from 30 to 90\u00b0. Supination and pronation were normal. Plain radiographs were normal. Computed tomography (CT) with 3D reconstruction revealed a radio-dense ring measuring about 4 mm in the coronoid fossa of humerus. It had a radiolucent nidus measuring about 2 mm in diameter. There was a thin bony shell in the anterior aspect of the lesion. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of a sub-periosteal osteoid osteoma. A decision of arthroscopic excision was made .\nElbow arthroscopy was carried out under general anesthesia in lateral decubitus position. Standard proximal anteromedial viewing (anterior and 2 cm proximal to medial epicondyle) and proximal anterolateral instrumentation portals (anterior and 2 cm proximal to lateral epicondyle) were used for elbow arthroscopy. A 2.7-mm, 30\u00b0 arthroscope was used. The lesion was localised in the coronoid fossa. It appeared as a hyperaemic bony protuberance covered with hypertrophied synovium. Synovium was shaved with an arthroscopic shaver. Thin cortical shell over the lesion was removed with an arthroscopic shaver. The nidus was exposed and it shelled out easily upon manipulation with a curette. It was delivered through the anteromedial arthroscopic portal and sent for histopathology. The base of the lesion was cleaned with curette and burr. Normal bone deeper to the base of the lesion was not removed and posterior cortex was not perforated. No other arthroscopic releases were done.

Such symptoms occurred both in the postprandial state and during the night and were so frequent to impact negatively on her working capacity and quality of life. On admission to our Clinic, the patient had lost 35 kg and her body weight was stable. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM, Dexcom G4 PLATINUM) for seven days evidenced ample blood glucose excursions throughout the day, with glucose peaks above 200 mg/dL after meals, followed by a rapid fall below 55 mg/dL (a), which were associated with hypoglycemic symptoms as recorded in the patient\u2019s diary. It is interesting to note that low glucose levels occurred also during the night, as demonstrated by the considerable time spent below 55 mg/dL. Based on the continuous glucose profile showing a clear postprandial pattern of hypoglycemia associated with symptoms, we posed the diagnosis of PBH. From CGM, we also calculated the main indexes of glucose variability; i.e., coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD), and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) that resulted in an increase, as reported in .\nThe patient was prescribed a normocaloric (1500 kcal) high-fiber (33 g), low-carbohydrate index (55) diet, which was divided into three meals and three snacks to avoid postprandial blood glucose peaks and prolonged fasting intervals (see ). Multivitamin and mineral supplements were also prescribed on the basis of biochemical analysis showing vitamin D (19 ng/mL) and iron (ferritin 10 ng/mL) deficiency.\nFollowing nutritional therapy, the patient demonstrated a modest improvement of hypoglycemic symptoms but asthenia and tiredness in the early morning associated with fingerstick glucose level in the low range (<70 mg/dL) persisted.

Nevertheless, he was dismissed with a diagnosis of transient hips arthritis and was treated with anti-inflammatory therapy. A few days later, because of worsening pain and the inability to walk, he returned to our department and was hospitalized.\nOn admission, a spine radiograph showed a slight reduction in the thickness of the L5 soma. Moreover, a spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the T1 post-enhancement increased signals of the anulus L4\u2013L5, of the opposite end-plates of L4 and L5, of the adjacent soft tissues and of the osteolytic area of the L5 pedicle. Therefore, a diagnosis of SD with associated osteomyelitis was made.\nThe blood exams revealed an increase in the inerythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (77 mm/h,) and C reactive protein (CRP) (2.17 mg/dL, normal values < 0.4 mg/dL). In contrast, the patient had a normal white blood cell count (WBC) count, a normal procalcitonin serum concentration (0.12 ng/mL, normal values < 0.25 ng/mL), and a negative Quantiferon TB-gold test.\nBroad-spectrum intravenous therapy with meropenem (100 mg/kg/day in three doses) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day in three doses) was started. Anti-inflammatory treatment was used for the first week and stopped with the complete resolution of the child\u2019s symptoms and his return to normal walking.\nAfter 3 weeks of therapy, the patient developed leukopenia with severe neutropenia (lowest WBC value of 5410/mm3, with 80/mm3 neutrophils). As both of the administered drugs have been associated with neutropenia [,], therapy was withdrawn and replaced with ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/day in three doses), which was carried on for another week until the second MRI. The images from this exam, performed after 4 weeks of total therapy, showed a reduction in the enhanced contrast, although there was not a complete resolution of the inflamed and infected state.\nBecause of the radiological improvement, the normalization of the inflammatory factors, and the absence of symptoms in the child, he was discharged with an oral therapy of linezolid (30 mg/kg/day in three doses) and cefuroxime axetil (30 mg/kg/day in two doses). After 12 weeks of oral therapy, another MRI was performed. The images showed a complete resolution of the infectious process. shows differences between the MRI at admission and during the follow-up. Therefore, therapy was stopped (the patient received 16 weeks of therapy in total). The child was completely asymptomatic, and all of the blood exams, including the acute phase reactants and blood culture, were in the normal range or negative.\nAll of the blood exams that were performed to determine the nature of the infection did not show positivity for any recent, causative infectious agent. Additionally, the immunological and autoimmunity screenings were normal.\nThe 3 year follow up did not reveal any problem after discharge.

{"clinical_note": "A 3 years old boy was admitted to our emergency department because he had been suffering from intermittent lumbar pain for several months and had difficulty walking for a few days. The patient\u2019s personal medical history was uneventful until 4 months earlier when, playing with a friend, the child had a lumbar trauma that caused neither detectable skin lesions nor impairment to leg mobilization, and was not investigated. However, in the following weeks, the child started to feel pain whenever his father picked him up and was clearly more irritable than he had been in the past. A fever was never reported. Three months after the trauma, because of the increased lumbar pain, the child refused to walk. For this reason, he visited an emergency care unit and underwent a physical examination; laboratory blood tests, including a WBC and CRP serum level; and a full spine radiography. No abnormal results were detected. Oral therapy with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for a week was prescribed. During this period, a partial resolution of the pain was demonstrated.\nHowever, ten days after the drug discontinuation, the pain worsened. Therefore, the child was brought to our department. Here, a physical examination, an abdominal ultrasonography, and the laboratory blood tests were still normal or only slightly abnormal. The ESR reached 60 mm/h, CRP was 1.47 mg/dL (normal values < 0.4 mg/dL), and procalcitonin was 0.26 ng/mL (normal values < 0.25 ng/mL), but the patient had a normal WBC count. His body temperature was in the normal range. However, an MRI scan of the spine revealed that a T1 post-enhancement had increased the signal of the anulus L3\u2013L4 of the adjacent soft tissue; this outcome is highly suggestive of an infective SD ().\nWhile awaiting the results of the blood culture, a broad-spectrum, anti-infective intravenous therapy was started with piperacillin\u2013tazobactam (100 mg/kg/day divided into three doses) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day divided into three doses). Oral anti-inflammatory therapy was also provided.\nThe boy experienced rapid clinical improvement. In the first weeks, he stopped feeling pain and started walking again without lameness. Anti-inflammatory therapy was discontinued after several days. After 4 weeks of therapy, the boy underwent a second MRI, which showed no significant radiological change (). The CRP was negative, but the ESR and procalcitonin were still slightly abnormal. The therapy was modified, and piperacillin-tazobactam was replaced by meropenem (100 mg/kg/day divided into three doses), while continuing vancomycin.\nAfter 8 weeks of intravenous therapy, the inflammatory index was completely negative, and the child felt no more pain and could walk normally. The intravenous therapy was switched to oral therapy with linezolid (30 mg/kg/day in three doses) and cefuroxime axetil (30 mg/kg/day in two doses), and the child was discharged from the hospital.\nAfter 12 weeks of total therapy, another MRI was performed to determine if therapy should be discontinued. The MRI showed an important reduction in the signal alterations, although residual irregularities of the end-plates of L3 and L4 were reported (). On the basis of these findings, the child remained on antibiotic therapy for another month and then stopped. He received 16 weeks of therapy in total.\nDuring hospitalization, all of the immunological exams that were performed were normal, and no causative infectious agent was documented. The whole therapy was well-tolerated, without any side effects.\nDuring a 3 year follow-up, the child experienced only one episode of back pain, for which he promptly underwent an MRI that ruled out the possibility of a reactivation of the infection, but he showed a slightly adipose evolution of the L3 and L4 body. After that episode, which rapidly and spontaneously resolved, the child never felt lumbar pain again and maintained a normal life.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}

Moreover, in the month before hospital admission, he had lost approximately 7 kg in weight. Finally, a previous evaluation of blood cell count had revealed HE (eosinophils 10,000/\u00b5L) without other significant alterations. The patient denied having recently taken drugs and had had contact with animals. His last trip to his country of origin was in December 2015.\nOn admission, a blood cell count and a morphological evaluation of a peripheral blood smear confirmed HE (white blood cells 21,950/\u00b5L, with eosinophils 13,762/\u00b5L, hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL, and platelets 237,000/\u00b5L) the absence of other cellular morphological abnormalities. In the following days, the patient presented fatigue and worsening of headache; therefore, attempts to evaluate HE and other signs and symptoms origin were made. A parasitological fecal examination and a Scotch tape test were performed on three samples with negative results. Organ infiltration was excluded through chest X-ray, brain magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and abdominal ultrasound. Toxoplasma, Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania, Schistosoma, Echinococcus, viral hepatitis, and HIV infection were also excluded.

{"clinical_note": "A 12-year-old girl presented to her general pediatrician complaining of asthenia and weight loss in the previous month. Her past medical and family history were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a painless hepato-splenomegaly without additional clinical signs. Abdominal ultrasound revealed an inhomogeneous liver appearance, abdominal lymphadenopathy and a hypo-echogenic solid neoformation in front of the celiac artery (35 \u00d7 13 mm). The patient was admitted to the Department of Pediatrics of the Meyer Children\u2019s Hospital for further diagnostic investigations.\nPhysical examination revealed palpable spleen and liver, a right inguinal lymph node of 1 cm and a lymph node in supraclavicular location, without any further objective anomaly. She had no fever. Initial laboratory tests found microcytic iron deficiency anemia (Hb = 9.8 g/dl, MCV = 65.5 ft., Ferritin = 4 ng/ml), with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), normal total protein and protein electrophoresis, a slight increase of lipase and colic acids with normal amylase. Blood biochemistry for kidney and liver function and urinalysis were normal. Primary immunologic work-up including lymphocyte subset and immunoglobulin levels were normal. Tests for malignancies (tumor markers and peripheral blood smear) and infectious investigations, including Mantoux Test and IGRA Assay resulted negative.\nChest X-ray was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the superior and inferior abdomen with contrast medium confirmed increased liver dimensions and its structural inhomogeneity with zones of signal alteration: some nodular, other confluent. It also revealed increased spleen size with zones of nodular signal alteration and multiple nodular formations in the following locations: hepatic hilar, mesenteric, lombo-aortic, at the retrocavity of the epiploon, and the greatest one in front of the celiac artery (diameter > 3.5 cm).\nSuspecting a systemic lymphoproliferative disease, we performed liver and lymph node ultrasound-guided biopsy, which showed negativity of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for potential agents of infectious diseases (including Mycobacteria and Bartonella species) on lymph node material, while it highlighted a non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, resembling sarcoidosis, and aspects of non-specific inflammation of the liver. (Fig. , ).\nSubsequently, we carried out measurements of serum and urinary calcium, serum phosphorus, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE), followed by a complete cardiac evaluation, and a complete ophthalmologic evaluation (including slit lamp), all of which resulted within normality.\nAt this point, given the biopsy results, we performed further lung studies: pulmonary function tests which showed mild restriction and decreased alveolar capillary diffusion. The chest X-Ray revaluation revealed a pattern compatible with mild fibrosis and enlarged lymph nodes. We decided to carry out a high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT), which showed widespread fibrous strands and multiple enlarged lymph nodes (right paratracheal area, at the supraaortic trunk origin, subcarinal, with the largest in this location measuring 30 \u00d7 17 mm, pericardiophrenic, bilaterally at axillary level and along the mammary vessels). The bronchoscopic investigation with analysis of the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid revealed: macrophages 70%, neutrophils 4% and lymphocytes 26% with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 9.2 (pathological value > 3.5).\nBased on these results, we carried out further investigations on liver tissue and lymph node with histochemical techniques: CD68 + nodules were found, suggestive of microgranulomas (Fig. and ).\nHaving ruled out other diagnoses, with suggestive histological findings in two different tissues (liver and lymph nodes) and considering lung involvement, we made the diagnosis of pediatric-onset adult sarcoidosis.\nDuring hospitalization, the condition of the child had always been good and she had always been afebrile. Considering lymph node hypertrophy and the signs of initial portal hypertension (due to compression of the hepatic vessels), we started therapy with prednisone 40 mg/day, and subsequent cross-therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (250 mg/m2 increasing up to 1 g/m2).\nThe girl came back to our attention a month after discharge for a follow-up visit: she was found in good general condition, with hepatomegaly and without other clinical signs or symptoms. A brain MRI was performed in order to rule out cerebral involvement and it revealed normal findings.

Ultrasonography of abdomen revealed a 2 cm calculus in the right middle moiety of kidney non obstructing. Ultrasound scan of family members was not performed. Biochemical investigations of the proband revealed a persistent hypouricemia (sUA 97 \u03bcmol/L, 93 \u03bcmol/L). Other biochemical investigations including liver and renal functions were within normal limits. Fractional excretion of uric acid was 33%. Secondary causes of hypouricemia were ruled out. Decreased blood concentrations of UA together with markedly elevated fractional excretion of uric acid (FE-UA) caused us to suspect RHUC and therefore a genetic analysis of the SLC22A12 and SLC2A9 gene was performed after informed consent.

{"clinical_note": "A 76-year-old man was referred to our hospital for having lower back pain for 5 months, which was suspected to be L2/3 spondylitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). He had previously undergone cervical laminoplasty for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis 19 years earlier. He had a history of hypertension and diabetes. Although a history of BCG vaccination was unknown, he had no previous history of tuberculosis infection. He had also undergone transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (TUR-Bt) and had been treated with intravesical mitomycin C (MMC) for the bladder cancer 1.5 years earlier. Four months later, he again underwent TUR-Bt, received intravesical MMC, and started BCG therapy for the recurrence of bladder cancer. After the sixth course of intravesical BCG therapy, he was aware of systemic weakness and loss of appetite, and was unable to walk. He appeared to have septic shock and therefore was treated in the intensive care unit. In spite of systemic analyses, the source of his infection and the causative bacteria could not be identified. He was subsequently diagnosed with hypercytokinemia caused by BCG therapy. He showed clinical improvement without the administration of antituberculosis drugs, and was discharged 9 months before he came to our hospital.\nExcept for a temperature of 37.2 \u00b0C, his vital signs were within normal limits. Although there were no motor and sensory disturbances in the legs, he was unable to walk owing to lower back pain. Physical examination demonstrated vertebral tenderness at the L2/3 level. Laboratory analysis demonstrated a normal white blood cell (WBC) count of 6300 /\u03bcL, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 53 mm/h, and a high C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 2.7 mg/dL. There were no other abnormal laboratory findings regarding anemic changes, kidney function, or liver function. The patient did not receive tuberculin skin testing.\nThere were no notable findings on electrocardiogram or chest X-ray. X-ray of the lumbar spine displayed collapsed endplates of L2/3. Sagittal T1-weighted MRI displayed a decreased signal in the L2/3 disc and the vertebral bodies (Fig. ). Sagittal T2-weighted MRI displayed an increased signal in the L2/3 disc and fluid collection in the anterior part of the vertebral bodies (Fig. ). Axial T2-weighted MRI displayed an increased signal around the posterior area of the vertebral bodies, which extended into the left epidural space and reached the peripheral muscle tissue and the area near the aorta (Fig. ).\nOn the second day of hospitalization, the patient underwent an L2/3 disc biopsy, but the general bacteria culture was negative, and the smear was negative for Ziehl-Neelsen staining. The patient\u2019s blood culture was negative, and the result of T-SPOT.TB\u00ae (T-SPOT), which is a type of interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), were also negative; the number of spots for both 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target (ESAT-6) and 10-kDa culture filtrate antigen (CFP-10) was 5 or less. The causative bacteria remained unidentified and therefore he was started on empirical therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone. On the fifth day of hospitalization, a plain computed tomography scan, which was performed for systemic examination, showed soft tissue development in the adjacent abdominal aorta at the L3 level (Fig. ), which was suspected to be an infectious aortic aneurysm. A 2-stage operation was planned for the spondylitis with adjacent infectious aortic aneurysm, to prevent rupture of the infectious aortic aneurysm, obtain spine stabilization, drain the abscess and make a diagnosis. On the tenth day in hospital, because the risk of rupture was considered to be low, the patient underwent an L2/3 laminectomy followed by posterior fixation using percutaneous pedicle screws at T12, L1, L4, and L5 as the first stage. Specimen cultures of the lumbar vertebrae, yellow ligament, necrotic tissue, etc., were negative for general bacteria, specimen smears were also negative for Ziehl-Neelsen staining, and there were no pathological findings of caseating granuloma or necrosis. On the fiftieth day of hospitalization, because the infection had been controlled but the inflammatory response was sustained, he underwent replacement of the aneurysm with a synthetic graft by vascular surgeons, and lesion curettage and L2/3 anterior interbody fusion by iliac bone transplantation as the second stage. Spinal surgery was performed in the transabdominal approach owing to the risk of rupture. On pathological analyses, the L2/3 intervertebral disc, vertebral bone, and tissue surrounding the vertebral bone and aorta showed caseating granuloma and necrosis with multinucleated giant cells and epithelioid cells upon hematoxylin-eosin staining, and positive bacilli upon Ziehl-Neelsen staining. The tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction (Tb-PCR) result of the tissue was also positive, using COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae MTB Test, which is a real-time PCR system targeting the 16S rRNA gene region of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA. Owing to the patient\u2019s history of BCG therapy, negative T-SPOT, pathological findings, and positive Tb-PCR, the pathogenic bacteria of the spondylitis was considered to be BCG. We then started multidrug therapy with antituberculosis drugs, including isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RFP), and ethambutol (EB), because BCG is typically resistant to pyrazinamide (PZA). PCR-based genomic deletion analysis was performed using the specimens to distinguish BCG from the other M. tuberculosis complexes. Specifically, multiplex PCR was performed utilizing region of difference 1 (RD1), which is present in the DNA of other M. tuberculosis complexes but is deleted in the DNA of BCG []. Primers ET1, ET2 and ET3 bind and amplify a 190-bp region in BCG, whereas a 160-bp region is amplified in the other M. tuberculosis complexes, as observed by electrophoresis on an agarose gel. A clinical isolate sample from our patient was identified as BCG with a deletion in RD1 (Fig. ). Specimen cultures from the first-stage and second-stage operation were later identified as members of the M. tuberculosis complex using a mycobacteria growth indicator tube. After therapeutic intervention, the patient\u2019s WBC count, ESR level, and CRP level were improved and MRI displayed no signs of active infection in the spine, epidural space, peripheral muscle tissue, or aorta. On the ninetieth day after hospitalization, the patient was discharged from our hospital and transferred to a different hospital for physical rehabilitation.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

{"clinical_note": "A 23-year-old French man of African origin, an elite football player, sustained a midshaft anterior cortex tibial stress fracture 2.5 years ago. Initially, he was treated with cast immobilization, no weight bearing for 3 months, ultrasound stimulation, and electromagnetic field therapy. The fracture did not heal; he had pain during gait, so he continued no weight bearing for 3 additional months. After that period, the fracture site still was not healed, so he underwent an operation performed by his team doctor. In this operation, the medullary canal of his tibia was reamed and an im nail was inserted.\nUnfortunately, the fracture site did not consolidate again, even 18-months postoperatively, so he presented to our clinic for counseling. It was obvious from the X-ray (Fig. ) that a nonunion of the fracture had occurred.\nHe did not smoke tobacco and he had a free medical history. When he presented to our clinic, the area at the fracture site was swollen and painful when palpated. The pain got worse when he attempted to walk with full weight bearing, so he had to use crutches. An examination of the peripheral nervous system of his lower extremities did not provide us with any pathologic findings. In addition, the laboratory examinations for possible endocrine or metabolic disorders were negative (Table ), so he was advised to have a reoperation to address this nonunion. The treatment options for such cases include nail exchange, drilling of the fracture site, bone grafting, or removal of the nail and internal fixation with a plate. We performed a tension band plate fixation, which is a technique already described for the treatment of anterior tibial stress fractures that failed non-operative treatment [], with bone grafting and without removing the nail.\nA longitudinal incision was made just lateral to the anterior tibial crest centered over the fracture site. The fascia over the tibialis anterior was divided, the muscle lifted off and the fracture site was visualized. The necrotic bone and callus at the fracture site was debrided with the use of an osteotome and a curette. Transverse drilling around the fracture site was done to promote healing and osteoblastic activity. Bone marrow from the ipsilateral iliac crest was inserted into the fracture site and a tension band plate was applied over the im nail.\nWe used a 6-hole, 4.5 mm locking compression plate. The plate was prebended and the screws were placed in a compression manner to achieve a tension band effect to the fracture site. A cortical screw was put first to the distal hole closest to the fracture site and then a cortical screw to the closest hole proximal to the fracture site to ensure compression of the fracture. Consequently, one unicortical locking screw was inserted proximally to the fracture site and the other two distally. With the use of locking and non-locking screws we minimized the pressure at the periosteum, which can damage blood supply to the poorly vascularized bone. The screws were angled in a different axis in order to bypass the nail (Fig. ).\nPostoperatively, our patient was advised to wear an orthotic boot and to not bear weight for 6 weeks. Range of motion exercise involving knee and ankle and isometric exercises were initiated immediately postoperatively. After 6 weeks he progressed to weight bearing as tolerated. At 3 months postoperatively he was pain free and started light jogging, swimming, and plyometric and core stabilization exercises. At 6 months postoperatively the complete radiologic union of the fracture was evident (Figs. and ). He was symptom free; he resumed at that time a full training program and he returned to play football 6 months postoperatively at his preinjury high competition level.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 16-year-old boy with bilateral TMJ ankylosis was referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery department of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The bilateral TMJ ankylosis had been induced due to trauma when the patient was 4 years old. He had undergone TMJ surgery twice, but the operations had been unsuccessful and the TMJ ankylosis relapsed ().\nThe clinical examination revealed no systemic diseases. The patient\u2019s maximum incisal opening was 11mm. Because of the old injuries and unsuccessful operations, the mandibular deficiency had developed. The patient was experiencing sleeping disorders and mostly slept in a prone or a sitting position due to respiratory problems. The lateral and forward motions of the mandible were restricted. Based on the patient\u2019s condition and the past surgical history, a two-step treatment was performed. First, the gap arthroplasty method was applied, and afterwards, DO was performed.\nThe gap arthroplasty surgery was followed by physiotherapy. Approximately 3 to 10 days after the surgery, the patient was put on a soft diet and began the jaw-opening exercises. Three to four weeks after the surgery, a normal diet was started. After the discharge, the patient was visited once a week to evaluate the changes.\nThe osteodistractor was installed four months later (). After the installation, since the condylar stop had been removed in this case, and there was a possibility of upward and backward shift of the proximal mandibular segment, we used a custom-made device to prevent these movements. The Sh-device has a curved metal rod and two oval stoppers that can be connected to two areas, one to the patient\u2019s forehead and another to the upper lip (below the nose). The stoppers are made of a firm clear plastic; the inner stopper surface is covered with a layer of soft spongy tissue that provides comfort for the patient upon using the Sh-device (). The stoppers are attached to the back of the patient\u2019s head by two elastic bands, which keep the device on the patient\u2019s face. The elastic bands, which are attached to the orthodontic hooks on the mandibular premolars or molars, are connected to a small piece at the bottom of the lower stopper. The main pressure/traction of the Sh-device was applied on the distal mandibular segment, and the Sh-device prevented the proximal mandibular segment from moving upward and backward; therefore, the greatest displacement occurred at the distal mandibular segment. The mandible was driven forward at a rate of 0.5mm per day.\nAfter one month, we separated the Sh-device, and the mandible moved about 15 to 20mm forwards. The patient\u2019s breathing and sleeping improved. At the 8-year follow-up, the patient\u2019s profile was satisfactory.

{"clinical_note": "A 71-year-old man, originally from North Africa, with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, presented to our emergency department with a 2-month history of nonspecific abdominal symptoms: meteorism (bloating) and a subjective feeling of abdominal enlargement. Diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight loss, persistent fever, night sweats, headaches, anxiety, gastric ulcer disease, or skin rash were not reported. He did not report a neoplasm in the past and he had not undergone an abdominal examination before. He could not recall any episodes of pancreatitis or suffering from gall bladder stones. He had undergone a computed tomography (CT) scan a few days before which showed a tumor in the pancreatic head and he was referred to our clinic. Diabetes mellitus occurred 20 years ago and he was initially treated with orally administered anti-diabetic drugs for more than 12 years. Apart from diabetes and arterial hypertension he had no previous medical or surgical history. He has been treated with two different anti-hypertensives, two diuretics, acetylsalicylic acid, and insulin glargine. He reported an allergy to metformin. He did not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol.\nOn general physical examination, he was conscious and oriented and in fair general condition. He appeared to be in a good nutritional state (height 165 cm, weight 73 kg, body mass index 26.8 kg/m2). His lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. His heart examination was also normal. He had a soft, non-tender abdomen without any palpable masses. Icterus and lymphadenopathy were absent. His vital signs were normal.\nA routine laboratory analysis showed the following abnormal values: hemoglobin 12.5 g/dl (13.5\u201317.5), hematocrit 25% (40\u201353), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 78 fl (82\u201398), uric acid 10.2 mg/dl (< 7.0), creatinine 1.8 mg/dl (< 1.4), and random serum glucose 148 mg/dl. Transaminases and cholestasis parameter were normal. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 6.9% (52 mmol/mol). The serum tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 19\u20139 (CA19\u20139) were in normal range. Serum pancreatic lipase was slightly elevated (88 U/l, reference range < 65 U/l). The pancreatic elastase in stool was normal. There was no clinical evidence for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.\nAn ultrasound of his abdomen revealed a tumor of the uncinate process of the pancreas. The endoscopic ultrasound showed a mass in the area between the neck and the body of his pancreas, measuring approximately 24 mm in its largest dimension. The tumor compressed his splenic vein; however, there were no signs of infiltration. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated an almost 3 cm round, quite well-defined and homogeneous tumor formation in the area between the neck and absent body of his pancreas (Fig. ). The tail of the pancreas was absent as well. The tumor showed a slightly arterial hypervascular enhancement and a central calcification in the shape of a dot. There was no central hypoperfusion or necrosis. The imaging findings were not typically suggestive of exocrine pancreatic carcinoma or pancreatic endocrine tumor. After discussing the case at our interdisciplinary tumor board, we decided to perform a biopsy.\nThe initial fine-needle aspiration was performed via endoscopic ultrasound. However, the pathological analysis did not detect tumor cells in the aspiration material.\nIn the next step our patient underwent CT-guided biopsy of the mass. A histopathological examination (Fig. ) revealed the typical aspect of a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor with solid aggregates of isomorphic tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry showed intensive cytoplasmic staining for synaptophysin (Fig. ) and nuclear staining for Ki-67 in less than 2% of the tumor cells (Fig. ). No gastrin expression could be detected by immunohistochemistry.\nOur patient underwent pancreas resection because of the presence of a neuroendocrine tumor. On macroscopic examination, the tumor was 1.8 cm in maximum diameter (TNM staging, pT1). There was no vascular invasion present. None of the three lymph nodes was metastatic (TNM staging, pN0). The active proliferative rate of Ki-67 (a pathological grading marker) was 5%.\nWell-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas usually show the characteristic nested, trabecular, or gyriform pattern known from neuroendocrine neoplasms of other organs. There are, however, architectural and cytological variations in some tumors, including abortive gland formation or oncocytic and clear cell changes.\nIn our case, the differential diagnosis of the biopsy specimen was focused on a distinction from other epithelial pancreas neoplasms especially the solid variants of acinar cell carcinoma, solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, as well as pancreatoblastoma. The latter tumor types may also exhibit the nesting pattern observed in our case. Therefore, the intensive homogenous staining pattern for synaptophysin in our case provided an important argument for the diagnosis of a neuroendocrine tumor. This diagnosis was further corroborated in the resection specimen by the lack of features defining acinar cell carcinoma (for example, acinar differentiation) or pancreatoblastoma or solid papillary neoplasm (for example, pseudopapillary growth pattern).\nOur patient underwent a 68gallium-DOTATOC positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan 4 months later, which did not show increased metabolic uptake. Seven months after pancreas resection his HbA1c increased from 6.9 to 8.7%. This led us to modify his diabetes medication to a combination including insulin glargine, insulin glulisine, and metformin.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 26-year-old right-handed white woman with no significant medical history was diagnosed as having MS in 2013 at age 22 and experienced ongoing radiologic activity on both glatiramer acetate and dimethyl fumarate. She transitioned to natalizumab in July 2014 to stabilize disease activity, and her JCV antibody index was positive at 3.58 prior to starting natalizumab. She became clinically and radiologically stable with the initiation of natalizumab until November 2016 when a surveillance MRI of her brain showed asymmetric confluent non-enhancing hyperintensities in the bilateral subcortical precentral gyri consistent with PML (Fig. , ). Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) showed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for JCV of 15 copies/ml, and other CSF studies were within normal limits. A diagnosis of PML was made based on the compatible neuroimaging findings along with the presence of JCV DNA in the CSF. Natalizumab was discontinued after 27 total treatments. Our patient was asymptomatic at the time of PML diagnosis, and she was highly functioning with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 0. A decision was made to defer plasmapheresis at the time of diagnosis given her high functional status, subtle radiological change, and low viral titer. She was treated with orally administered mefloquine loading dose followed by 250 mg weekly and mirtazapine 15 mg daily.\nRepeat MRI at 2 months following diagnosis showed no changes in her brain lesions. She remained asymptomatic until 3 months after diagnosis when she noticed mild dysmetria of her left hand that progressed to a tremor. The following month a repeat brain MRI revealed a few small enhancing lesions in her left frontal lobe suggestive of IRIS (Fig. , ). The hyperintensities in the bilateral precentral gyri remained stable. Imaging of her cervical spine revealed a new non-enhancing cord lesion. She was then treated for 5 days with intravenously administered immunoglobulin and restarted on glatiramer acetate for MS treatment. A repeat CSF examination in February 2017 showed JCV PCR of 31 copies/ml.\nFive months following her diagnosis, a repeat brain MRI showed interval development of T2 signal abnormality with mild enhancement in multiple areas including the brainstem, cerebellum, and bilateral cerebral hemispheres (Fig. , ). A repeat lumbar puncture was performed. JCV PCR in the CSF was undetectable. Mefloquine and mirtazapine were discontinued. Given the MRI findings, she was treated for ongoing inflammation associated with IRIS versus a possible exacerbation of her underlying MS with high-dose intravenously administered methylprednisolone (IVMP) 1500 mg daily for 3 days. She was then transitioned from glatiramer acetate to ocrelizumab for treatment of MS. Six months following her diagnosis she reported changes in left hand dexterity and right upper extremity phasic spasms. A repeat lumbar puncture was performed and JCV PCR remained undetectable. She continued MRI surveillance followed by treatment with high-dose IVMP for a total of six courses until there was significant resolution of enhancement on her brain MRI (Fig. , ). Following treatment, she has residual left hand dysmetria and tremor as well as right upper extremity phasic spasms.

She did not have features of non-motor symptoms to suggest a diagnosis of idiopathic PD.\nThere was no history of previous stroke or vascular risk factors for stroke. She had not been on any medication which could cause extra-pyramidal symptoms.\nGeneral physical examination was normal. Neurological examination revealed hypomimia of the face with cogwheel rigidity and bradykinesia bilaterally (right more than left), predominantly in the upper limbs without pyramidal signs (the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III; item 18\u201332 was 36).

A vascular screen for stroke risk factors was negative. A DAT scan was unavailable due to lack of resources and financial constraints.\nShe was treated with a trial of levodopa (300 mg per day) and anti-platelet therapy which resulted in marked reduction in her jaw tremor and other extrapyramidal symptoms after 1 month of follow-up (UPDRS part III improved from 36 to 24).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 55-year-old Japanese woman had developed right-lateral chest and back pain 2 months prior to admission to our hospital. Thirteen years previously, she had undergone concurrent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and total hysterectomy for right ovarian tumor in other institution. She had no past history of other neoplasms. Physical examination revealed deep-tendon hyperreflexia in the lower extremities but no muscle weakness. Blood tests were unremarkable apart from a high serum concentration of cancer antigen 125 (134 U/mL; cutoff value, 35 U/mL). On fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was 6.6 in the right paraspinal region at the level of Th12 (Fig. ) and 8.8 in the right thyroid lobe; however, fine-needle aspiration cytology of the latter yielded no evidence of malignancy. CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an irregular mass in the right arch of Th12 vertebral bone that protruded into the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramen and was infiltrating surrounding soft tissue, the whole mass being of 35 \u00d7 78 \u00d7 36 mm (Fig. -). No primary tumor was detected in other organs or the abdominal or pleural cavities. Pathological examination of a CT-guided needle biopsy of the paraspinal lesion demonstrated papillary proliferation of epithelial cells with blunt nuclear atypia against a fibrotic background with psammomatous calcification (Fig. ). Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positive for paired box 8 (PAX8) (Roche Diagnostics; Basel, Switzerland), estrogen receptor (ER) (Roche Diagnostics), and Wilms\u2019 tumor 1 (WT1) (Roche Diagnostics), but negative for thyroglobulin (Nichirei; Tokyo, Japan) (Fig. ), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) (Roche Diagnostics), progesterone receptor (Roche Diagnostics), S100 protein (Roche Diagnostics), and calretinin (Roche Diagnostics). Staining for P53 (Roche Diagnostics) showed a non-mutational \u201cwild type\u201d pattern (Fig. ). Because the lesion was suspected of being a metastatic neoplasm from the previous ovarian tumor, we obtained the relevant clinicopathologic and operative records and found that our patient had had a 13- \u00d7 11- \u00d7 9-cm cystic tumor that did not involve the ovarian surface (Fig. ). Peritoneal cytology was negative; however, the tumor had been ruptured intraoperatively. Lymph-node biopsy was not performed during the original surgery. The six slides available for microscopic review in retrospect, which included all the 6 sections (1 on each slide) submitted for the previous diagnosis of the primary tumor, showed cuboidal to columnar epithelium with minimal cytologic atypia proliferating in hierarchical branches with no invasive features, micropapillary components, or peritoneal implants (Fig. \u2013), the diagnosis being conventional Stage IC1 SBT/APST according to the current World Health Organization (WHO) and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2014 classifications. All the above-listed immunochemistry markers were identical in the previous ovarian tumor and the present paraspinal neoplasm, except for Ki-67 (Agilent Technologies; Santa Clara, CA, USA), which had labeling indices of 1 and 5%, respectively. It was therefore concluded that the paraspinal lesion was a bone metastasis of transformed LGSC originating from the previous SBT/APST in the right ovary. The patient underwent radiotherapy (30 Gray in 10 fractions) for the paraspinal lesion, which relieved her pain, followed by chemotherapy treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin plus bevacizumab. She remains alive with right-sided pleural effusion and suspected metastases in the Th3 and Th4 vertebrae 168 months after the initial surgery.\nNeither the primary nor metastatic tumor harbored KRAS mutation (codon 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, or 146) according to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a reverse sequence-specific oligonucleotide methodology (LSI Medience; Tokyo, Japan), nor BRAF V600E mutation according to real-time PCR (LSI Medience).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'interprets laboratory or other study findings', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}

{"clinical_note": "A 65-year old woman, on dialysis for 17 years, told her doctor she was exhausted and that she thought it was because she was taking too many drugs. The patient is an intelligent, independent, acculturated woman who lives alone in the French countryside.\nHer medical history is complex: she was treated with lithium for about 20 years (from age 20 to 40). This was discontinued after she developed CKD; in recent years, under treatment with valproic acid and lamotrigine, her psychophysical balance has been good,.\nShe started smoking when she was 19 years old (30 cigarettes/day) and developed a smoke-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was obese in early adulthood; arterial hypertension was diagnosed at age 30 and type 2 diabetes at age 32, treated using oral hypoglycemic drugs, but she eventually lost about 20 kg, making it possible for antidiabetic drugs to be discontinued. She underwent total thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma at age 41, and started levothyroxine therapy afterwards. Due to a progressive worsening of the kidney function she started hemodialysis at age 50. Her kidney disease was probably multifactorial (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heavy smoking, lithium therapy).\nSeven years after dialysis start, she underwent left hemicolectomy for colon adenocarcinoma, and two years later, left quadrantectomy followed by radiotherapy for ductal mammary adenocarcinoma. She underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy for severe tertiary hyperparathyroidism at age 62. Due to the presence of severe scoliosis, and the development of peripheral neuropathy, she uses painkillers regularly.\nAt the time of the present report, she was on thriceweekly hemodiafiltration, with good dialysis tolerance and high dialysis efficiency (Daugirdas 2 Kt/V: 1.6\u20131.8).\nHer most recent treatment included antihypertensive drugs (spironolactone 100 mg, amlodipine 20 mg, perindopril 2.5 mg), antipsychotic drugs (valproic acid 600 mg, lamotrigine 100 mg), thyroid hormone (levothyroxine 150 \u03bcg), vitamin D, bicarbonate and calcium supplements (calcium carbonate 1 g, sodium bicarbonate 500 mg, vitamin D 25-OH 100,000 UI once a month), potassium and phosphate binders (sodium polystyrene sulphonate, on non-dialysis days and sevelamer 2.4 g per day), darbopoietin 20 \u03bccg once weekly.\nThe clinical examination revealed a woman with good psychophysical balance, a moderate impairment in nutritional status, and a severe comorbidity burden (weight 54 Kg, height 155, BMI: 23 Kg/m2; subjective global assessment: B; malnutrition inflammation index: 10; Charlson index: 9). Apart from signs of chronic bronchitis, and an aortic 2/6 heart bruit, the clinical examination was unremarkable; arterial blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg, with mild orthostatic hypotension (135/80 mmHg); heart rate was 68 bpm. The most recent biochemical results are reported in Table .\nThe patient complained of severe fatigue, which had recently increased, and asked her doctor if he thought this could be the result of taking too many drugs.\nIn fact we thought our patient was right about pharmacologic interference, and felt that levothyroxine was the most likely candidate. A biochemical control disclosed a relevant increase in TSH (13.07 mU/L), as compared with her previous routine twice-yearly control (4.14 mU/L).\nIn retrospect, the levothyroxine dose was already high for a woman weighing about 55 Kg, and a reduction in the absorption of levothyroxine should already have been suspected.\nThree of her chronic drugs display potential interference with levothyroxine: calcium carbonate, sevelamer and kayexelate. Since her sevelamer dose had recently been increased from 800 mg once daily to 800 mg 3 times per day, this long-scting phosphate binder was the most likely candidate. In keeping with this hypothesis, one month after discontinuation of sevelamer and modification of the timing of levothyroxine treatment (in the morning after night fasting) TSH was once more in the normal range. In the three months that followed, her levothyroxine dose was reduced to 100 micrograms per day. A further attempt to reintroduce sevelamer, taken at least 6 h after levothyroxine, led to a new increase in TSH (TSH 12.66 mUI/l), once more corrected by discontinuation of sevelamer.\nPubmed and EMBASE were explored (start to February 15th 2018) with the aim of retrieving papers related to dialysis, levothyroxine and phosphate binders. The following terms were employed: (a) dialysis, hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration, renal replacement therapy; (b) phosphate binder(s), sevelamer, calcium carbonate, calcium acetate, aluminum hydroxide, lanthanum carbonate; (c) levothyroxine, thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Due to the low number of papers retrieved by this search, a further search was performed combining (b) and (c). The searches, paper selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate (EC and VC); a further search on Google med did not lead to further papers. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third party (GBP). A manual search of the reference lists from identified articles was done to identify additional articles. The search strategy and flow-chart is reported in Fig. .\nGiven the small number of papers retrieved, and their high heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not performed, and the data were narratively discussed, in relation to other sources of information (data obtained in healthy volunteers, or in other diseases).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows individual\u2019s risk factors for development of condition', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'knows modifications of a therapeutic regimen within the context of continuing care']"}

He had no known medical illnesses and was well until the evening prior to presentation, at which time he developed obvious right-sided chest pain radiating to his ipsilateral shoulder with persistent chest tightness. This tightness was described as sticking in nature, significantly worse on deep inspiration and with movement, and relieved by leaning forward or lying down. There was an associated dry cough but no hemoptysis. There was no history of trauma, injury, difficulty in breathing, or palpitations. He was tall and thin and described himself as otherwise quite healthy. He had never previously been admitted to a hospital. He reported no significant chronic medical history, such as primary hypertension, any type of heart disease, disturbed microcirculation, peripheral neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, an impaired immune system, malignancies, leukemia, the long-term administration of corticosteroids, liver cirrhosis, renal failure, urinary tract infection, or hemodialysis. He also reported no history of infection, such as tuberculosis, any type of hepatitis, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There was no prior history of traumas, blood transfusions, surgical procedures, or other serious events in his medical history. He had not lived in an epidemic area and had no history of toxin or radioactive exposure. He denied a personal or family history of bleeding diathesis but reported a 10-year history of smoking 8\u201310 cigarettes per day. He was an office worker by occupation. He had experienced similar symptoms on one occasion 4 years previously. No abnormalities were detected at that time, and his symptoms resolved.\nA physical examination (PE) revealed a young man who was awake and alert but in mild to moderate painful distress.

The examining physician noted slight tenderness along the right posterolateral chest wall along the eighth and tenth ribs. Breath sounds and percussion were documented as normal. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with a normal axis. PSP was considered, and a standing chest X-ray (CXR) was requested. The radiographic findings revealed a right-sided PSP (approximately 30%) with a small amount of pleural effusion (Fig. ). A right thoracostomy tube (28-F, straight) was immediately placed under sterile conditions; approximately 50 mL of light red pleural effusion flowed out from the chest tube after placement, and good fluctuation of the water column in the drainage reservoir was observed. Another CXR was performed to evaluate the position of the thoracostomy tube and re-expansion of his right lung (Fig. ). Our patient\u2019s vital signs stabilized, and his right-sided chest pain was apparently alleviated after chest tube placement; therefore, he was referred to the respiratory service with parenteral analgesia.\nWhile in the respiratory department, approximately 420 mL of blood was drained from the thoracostomy tube over 15 minutes. He developed obvious hemodynamic instability with hypovolemic shock (his blood pressure dropped from 110/70 to 75/50 mmHg), and he was subsequently admitted to the cardiothoracic surgical ward after fluid resuscitation. During the 4 hours after admission, 750 mL of blood was drained through the thoracostomy tube. His hemoglobin level dropped from 12.6 g/dL to 9.2 g/dL. A prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of 19 seconds was noted (normal reference of 14 seconds). Packed red cells and fresh frozen plasma were administered to our patient. Vitamin K (10 mg) and tranexamic acid (1 g) were also administered parenterally. He was unable to undergo an emergency chest computed tomography scan as his vital signs remained unstable after fluid resuscitation. Alternatively, a bedside supine CXR was performed when he was temporarily hemodynamic stable (Fig. ). A primary SHP associated with right TP was considered based on the radiographic findings. A re-examination of his chest revealed markedly decreased air entry on the right side with mild tracheal deviation.\nAn emergency limited posterolateral thoracotomy was performed for resection of the bullae, ligation of the bleeding adhesion, and irrigation of the pleural cavity, and mechanical pleurodesis was implemented. Approximately 800 mL of blood and clots and a collapsed right lung with several apical bullae were observed. There was a small (less than 1.0 cm) tan lesion noted on the dome of the right side of his chest. Bullous apical tissues of the right lung adhering to the thoracic wall and adhesions at the region of the subclavian artery were identified as the source of bleeding. Aberrant blood vessels growing from the chest wall through the adhesion bands into the pleural lesion were thought to be torn once the lung collapsed. These bleeding blood vessels may also have arisen from the surface of ruptured bullae. Histopathology revealed that the bullous and string-like tissues were rich in blood vessels and were granulomatous.\nSubsequently, the drainage from his chest tube became minimal. A standing CXR performed on day 6 of admission after removal of the thoracostomy tube showed complete re-expansion of his right lung. His hemoglobin level rose to 10.1 g/dL after a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells, and his PT normalized. He remained stable and was discharged within 1 week (6 days postoperatively). He returned to an out-patient department for follow-up two times. The right-sided posterolateral surgical incision had healed on the 14th postoperative day. Full expansion of lungs was confirmed using a standing CXR on the 14th postoperative day and at 3 months after discharge. He was healthy as usual with no complaints or illness.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

His symptoms were relieved by mobilization and met the RLS diagnostic criteria. His IRLS score was 11. He felt very uncomfortable upon waking in the morning and claimed that even prolonged sleep did not relieve his fatigue. His average sleep duration was 10 hours. His physical examination and laboratory tests yielded normal findings, including a serous ferritin level of 69 ng/mL.

His symptoms met the RLS diagnostic criteria, with an IRLS score of 16. However, he involuntarily tapped his right heel once every few seconds but did not report any discomfort related to this. Ordinarily, leg discomfort is bilateral in RLS. The patient's discomfort in the right leg could have been masked by his tapping; thus, his symptoms were consistent with RLS's typical presentation.\nHis average sleep duration was 9.5 hours. He was receiving pharmacotherapy for panic disorder, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dyspepsia. He refused additional pharmacotherapy. Laboratory tests returned normal findings, except for a ferritin level of 34.7 ng/mL and a hypoproteinemic serum protein level of 6.6 g/dL. His physical examination was unremarkable, except for emaciation (body mass index: 17.0 kg/m2).\nDiagnostic PSG revealed a high baseline obstructive apnea-hypopnea index in the supine position (Table ), which was associated with remarkable respiratory efforts, and a PLM index of 32.2, which was associated with bilateral gross knee flexion accompanied by EEG arousals (PLM arousal index during sleep: 10.3). All his PLMs occurred during sleep. No tapping-like movements were observed when he lay on the bed with extended knees, which suggested that knee flexion induced the movements.\nAt-home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment was initiated with an auto-titrating device.

The first intestinal transplant was lost due to volvulus 2 months post-transplant. Retransplantation was performed 18 months ago. Viremic cytomegalovirus (CMV) gastroenteritis was diagnosed 1 year post-transplant. Treatment with intravenous ganciclovir and later oral valganciclovir was successful, and CMV PCR remained negative in blood and intestinal biopsies during follow-up. The patient also suffered another volvulus of the colon, which was successfully corrected operatively. Mild grade 1 acute rejection in the colon occurred 2 months later; the small intestine was normal. The rejection resolved quickly with intravenous steroids; follow-up biopsies at 1 week were normal. After the rejection episode, there were nine follow-up endoscopies showing only mild segmental erythema and distorted mucosal vascular pattern on a confined area in the colon; we speculated the previous volvulus as a cause for these mild findings. In biopsy specimens, there were no signs of rejection or inflammation, and viral samples were negative.\nNorovirus gastroenteritis was diagnosed 2 months after the rejection. The patient was admitted to the hospital due to dehydration, abdominal pain, and fever. Prior to this, the patient's family members had suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis, presumably of viral origin. In our patient, gastroenteritis symptoms with watery diarrhea persisted, and the patient needed repeated episodes of hospitalization due to dehydration. Norovirus PCR from the stools remained repeatedly positive, and the norovirus infection was considered a cause for the chronic diarrhea. Endoscopy findings were unchanged. Nearly 3 months after the initial norovirus infection diagnosis, treatment with oral immunoglobulin was started. An intravenous immunoglobulin solution (Privigen\u00ae) was given orally at a dose of 1250 mg (25 mg/kg body weight) four times daily for 2 days (altogether eight doses). The immunoglobulin solution did not bypass the gastric barrier. Tacrolimus trough levels during the preceding 4 months had been stable above 10 ng/L (range 11.5\u201318.3 ng/L), and the patient had received triple immunosuppression therapy with MPA 360 mg twice daily and methylprednisolone 6 mg daily.\nFour days after the end of the immunoglobulin treatment, the patient was again admitted to hospital due to fever, increased diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Endoscopy via colostomy was performed, and severe biopsy-proven rejection grade 2\u20133 was diagnosed in the small-bowel and colon (Fig. and Fig. ).

Clinical examination revealed a voluminous palpable mass occupying the left quadrat of his abdomen. Abdominal ultrasound imaging showed a huge cystic mass posterior to the pancreas, compressing the stomach. Abdominal computer tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of a huge cystic retroperitoneal lesion, which measured 22 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 10 cm (Figure A,B). The lesion showed close intimacy to the posterior aspect of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound fluid aspiration was negative for CA19-9 and amylase, whereas biopsy samples were inconclusive on the nature of the lesion.

The patient's vital signs and blood CEA and CA19-9 were within normal range. The patient underwent complete excision of the cystic mass. Histology demonstrated the presence of pheochromocytoma, which arose from adrenal tissue and demonstrated immunohistopositivity to chromogranin and synaptophysin. Due to lesion size and microvascular invasion, it was categorized as malignant.\nDue to their evolution in the retroperitoneal space, pheochromocytomas may grow significantly in size and remain asymptomatic for a long period of time. Moreover, contrary to solid, cystic pheochromocytomas may not present typical clinical symptomatology or urine values of catecholamine metabolites may be found within normal range.

Although the presentation is usually silent, clinical manifestations may include aborted sudden death, chest pain, arrhythmia, and/or exercise-induced presyncope or syncope. The FFRCT, derived from the usual data set from coronary CT angiography, was recently developed to evaluate functional ischemia of the coronary artery.

Past medical history included previous breast cancer post-lumpectomy and radiotherapy, remote history of vulvar and rectal cancer post wide-debulking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and ventilator-dependent respiratory failure with tracheostomy. Home medications included albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer, alprazolam, amlodipine, aripiprazole, budesonide/formoterol metered dose inhaler, citalopram, tamoxifen, tiotropium inhaler, trazodone, and oxycodone. She reported an allergy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient initially presented to another facility complaining of fever, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and increasing oxygen demands. On examination, the patient was not in acute distress. All systems were negative except for diminished lung sounds with rhonchi bilaterally. A chest X-ray demonstrated left upper lobe pneumonia. Blood cultures were drawn, and a sample of tracheostomy secretions was sent for culture and sensitivities. She was initiated on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for treatment of healthcare-associated pneumonia. The patient reported a history of Clostridium difficile colitis and was started on oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole. On day 2, a bronchoscopy was performed with washings sent for culture. Both respiratory cultures grew MDRPA while blood cultures remained negative. The susceptibility profile is outlined in Table . Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to meropenem at 2 g IV every 8 hours, and inhaled tobramycin was added. A repeat bronchoscopy was performed on day 12 due to mucus plugging and lack of clinical response. This culture grew persistent MDRPA, necessitating the addition of IV tobramycin on day 16. Inhaled tobramycin was switched to inhaled colistin on day 20. On day 23, tobramycin IV and metronidazole were discontinued and the meropenem dose was decreased.\nOn day 24, a 12-French chest tube was successfully placed into the left upper lobe abscess. Approximately 30 mL of purulent material was aspirated and sent for culture. Growth from this drainage continued to demonstrate MDRPA. One day after chest tube insertion, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest demonstrated significantly diminished fluid component of the left upper lobe abscess with drain positioned in the air-containing component; residual left upper lobe and left lingular pneumonia and pulmonary emphysema was also noted. The patient failed to improve and on day 28 ceftolozane-tazobactam was initiated at 1.5 g IV every 8 hours. A repeat chest CT scan on day 30 showed a decrease in the left upper gas-fluid collection, but persistent dense pneumonia of the left upper lung and a new smaller infiltrate in the left lower lobe.\nTwo days after the repeat chest CT, the patient was transferred to our facility for worsening pneumonia, requiring a higher level of care and CTS consultation. Abnormal clinical examination findings included diffusely diminished lung sounds, rales in the left lower lobe, a left pigtail chest tube drain, tachycardia with heart rate of 120 beats per minute, and tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient's chest tube was intact with a small amount of thick, white drainage, which was sent for culture, along with 2 sets of blood cultures. Ceftolozane-tazobactam 1.5 g IV every 8 hours was continued, and meropenem was stopped. The patient was initiated on tobramycin 280 mg (7 mg/kg) IV every 24 hours. CTS diagnosed the condition as a pulmonary abscess with bronchopulmonary fistula (BPF). The patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate, and continued medical management and drainage via chest tube was recommended. Repeat cultures from the pleural fluid drainage continued to grow MDRPA, while blood cultures remained negative. Susceptibility testing for ceftolozane-tazobactam was requested and performed using an investigational elipsometer (E)-strip. On day 36 overall (day 5 post-transfer), a repeat bronchoscopy was performed. Culture of the washings grew Acinetobacter baumaunii. Additionally, the results from the ceftolozane-tazobactam E-strip for Pseudomonas finalized, demonstrating an MIC of 12 mg/L (nonsusceptible). Chest CT on day 37 demonstrated mild interval increase in the air-fluid collection size, drain in place, persistent extensive left upper lobe pneumonia, and mild improvement in the lingula and left lung base. With no improvement and the growth of Acinetobacter, ceftolozane-tazobactam was discontinued on day 39, after 12 days total. Meropenem at 1.5 g (pediatric dosing of 40 mg/kg) IV every 8 hours and colistin 100 mg (2.5 mg/kg) IV every 12 hours were started.

His cirrhosis was diagnosed in October 2016 per clinical history and findings on Computed Tomography (CT). His disease was complicated by Grade 2 esophageal varices, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). He also had one hospitalization approximately 1 month prior to admission for an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB), requiring four variceal bands. He had no history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). On admission, his model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was 20; his Child-Pugh Score was 12, placing him in Class C. His last drink was 32 days prior to presentation.\nOn arrival he was afebrile, tachycardic, and mildly hypertensive, but appeared comfortable. Physical examination was remarkable for symmetrical proximal muscle tenderness and weakness - \u2158 in the upper extremities and \u2157 in the lower extremities. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric; sensation was intact. Laboratory testing was significant for leukocytosis, as well as elevations in the creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), white blood cells (WBC), and creatine kinase (CK) (Table ). The patient was also found to have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 71 mm/h, C-reactive Protein-Quantitative (CRP-QT) at 2.7 mg/dL, and lactate 3.5 mmol/L. Chronic abnormalities in his hemoglobin, albumin, INR, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were also present, although remained stable throughout admission. Urinalysis demonstrated large blood on the dipstick, but was likely due to myoglobin, as microscopy revealed only 0-5 RBCs per high-power field. The etiology of his rhabdomyolysis was not apparent: he denied seizures, trauma, increased exertion, prolonged immobilization, recent travel, or use of statins, supplements, alcohol, or illicit drugs.\nHe was treated with aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation. Despite resolution of his acute kidney injury, clearing of his lactate, and initial improvement in his laboratory values, his CK, WBC, and AST plateaued and began to rise again on day four (Figure and Table ). With ongoing muscle injury and persistent weakness, other etiologies (including autoimmune, infectious, and malignant) were investigated. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis was negative for abscess or mass lesions; muscle biopsy of the right thigh showed no evidence of vasculitis or acquired inflammatory, necrotizing, or metabolic myopathy (Figure ). Anti-Jo-1 and anti-HMG-CoA reductase antibodies were both negative. Further medication review revealed he was recently started on rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy prophylaxis.

{"clinical_note": "A 59-year-old man presented with eight-week history of nausea, abdominal pain, and 20-lbs weight loss. Two years prior to the current presentation, the patient was diagnosed with a stage T1A nonsmall cell lung cancer of the right upper lobe (large cell carcinoma) and his initial staging Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET-CT) was negative except for the above-mentioned lesion. The patient refused surgery at the time and completed Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). His serial six-month interval surveillance imaging has been negative.\nWith his prior history of cancer and the current presentation, a total body PET-CT was ordered. This showed thickening of the wall of the gastric fundus, a mass in the tail of the pancreas (both with increased radiotracer uptake), and a 1.1-cm filling defect within the splenic vein consistent with thrombus (Figure ). Upper endoscopy showed a 5-cm infiltrative and ulcerated mass with heaped-up margins and necrotic center located in the gastric fundus (Figure ). Gastric biopsies showed poorly differentiated carcinoma (positive TTF1 and cytokeratin AE1-3, negative CDX-2) (Figure ), suggestive of metachronous metastasis from a lung primary. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed and showed a 26 mm \u00d7 23 mm hypoechoic round mass in the tail of the pancreas with local vascular involvement and splenic vein thrombus (Figure ). EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) and fine needle biopsy (FNB) of the mass was performed through the gastric lumen (away from the gastric tumor to avoid tumor contamination or seeding by the needle tract). This confirmed neuroendocrine carcinoma (positive synaptophysin and chromogranin, positive Ki-67 and CDX-2, negative TTF1) (Figure ). Findings were suggestive of synchronous primary pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. Treatment options were discussed with the patient and his family. Patient opted for palliative care and received symptomatic treatment.\nMetastasis of primary lung tumor to the stomach is infrequent and sporadic. The pathogenesis is thought to be related to the tumor cell spread via the hematogenous and lymphatic routes, but there is no specific data demonstrating a particular tropism for a segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Only 21 sporadic cases have been reported in the English literature and involved different malignant cell types: squamous cell carcinoma (10 cases), adenocarcinoma (6 cases), small cell carcinoma (2 cases), pleomorphic (2 cases), and large cell carcinoma (1 case). Symptomatic cases presented with epigastric pain, chronic anemia, signs of GI bleed (hematemesis, melena), and gastric perforations (in two cases). The definite role of PET-CT in the diagnosis of GI metastasis from lung cancer is still controversial because of the few cases and lack of enough clinical data. EUS-FNA in combination with immunohistochemistry is useful for diagnosing metastatic lesions and differentiating those from synchronous primary lesions.,", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 65-year-old man histopathlogically diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis at the age of 35 years. The 12-lead electrocardiogram exhibited an intraventricular conduction disturbance and left superior axis. The left ventricle (LV) exhibited a progressive dilation with a contractile dysfunction (severe hypokinesis on the inferior and inferior and septum). He was implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy device with defibrillator capability. In spite of the administration of amiodarone 100 mg, sotalol 160 mg, carvedilol 7.5 mg, mexiletine 400 mg, enalapril 2.5 mg, and spironolactone 25 mg, the patient was admitted to our hospital due to repetitive drug-resistant VT episodes and decompensated heart failure. The LV exhibited dilation and contractile dysfunction with an LV ejection fraction of 18%. In addition to the amiodarone, sotalol, carvedilol, mexiletine, enalapril, and spironolactone, intensive treatment of a VT storm and decompensated heart failure was performed with lidocaine 40-100 mg/h and furosemide; however, the VTs still could not be controlled.\nThe clinical VT on the 12-lead electrocardiogram exhibited a right bundle branch block pattern and left superior axis (Figure ). The VT cycle length was 380 millisecond, with a widened QRS duration of 184 millisecond. RFA was performed to manage the VT storm.\nSteerable catheters were inserted from the right femoral vein and placed in the right atrium and ventricle of interest. The LV endocardium was accessed using the trans-septal approach. Electroanatomical mapping was performed with EnSite (Abbott, Chicago, IL). A 3.5-mm open-irrigated ablation catheter (Therapy\u2122 Cool Path\u2122 Duo: Abbott) was used for the ablation and mapping. Bipolar voltage maps of the endocardium of the LV and right ventricle (RV) were constructed at baseline (pacing rhythm). Low voltage zones, defined as <1.5 mV, were mainly located on the interventricular septum (IVS) and postero-inferior wall of the LV. The clinical VT was induced and was hemodynamically stable. Entrainment mapping revealed that the VT had a reentrant mechanism. Activation mapping was performed; however, it could not depict the entire circuit, suggesting that a part of the circuit was intramural and/or epicardial. We performed RFA on the inferior and infero-septal walls of the LV and IVS from both the RV and LV endocardium, based on the activation and/or substrate maps, targeting the low voltage zones and/or abnormal electrograms such as those with fragmented and double potentials (Figure A). The procedural endpoint was the noninducibility of the clinical VTs. RF current was delivered for up to 60 seconds in the power-controlled mode with 30-45 watt and an irrigation rate of 17 mL/min.\nWe performed sequential RFA from the LV and RV; however, the VT did not terminate or slow. A SURF ablation on the inferior IVS from both the LV and RV endocardium was also performed. The ablation catheter used on the LV was a 3.5-mm open-irrigated ablation catheter (Therapy\u2122 Cool Path\u2122 Duo: Abbott), and that on the RV was a 4-mm nonirrigated ablation catheter (Therapy\u2122 Thermocouple: Abbott). When performing the SURF ablation, two separate dispersive patches were used as the indifferent electrodes, with two separate generators in the power-control mode for the delivery of the SURF. RF current was delivered in the power-control mode starting at 10 watts, independently titrated up to 30 watts for each catheter with care taken to limit the temperature to <42\u00b0C for the irrigated catheter and <55\u00b0C for the nonirrigated catheter. The RF delivery was discontinued when the catheter tip impedance of either catheter dropped by more than 15 \u03a9 as monitored from both RF generators. Figure B shows the position of the two ablation catheters when the SURF ablation was performed from both the RV and LV endocardium. We performed the SURF ablation at two sites on the IVS. The mean percentage of the R-wave reduction achieved by the SURF ablation was 67% on the LV endocardium and 86% on the RV endocardium. The VT was terminated and/or slowed during the RF application on the inferior wall of the LV and inferior IVS. The total application time of the RFA was 3502 seconds.\nThe clinical VT could not be induced at the end of the procedure. However, a VT with a slightly different QRS morphology emerged 2 days after the session and his heart failure worsened and became more serious due to VT storms. He developed pulseless electrical activity after that, and required intubation, sedation with propofol, percutaneous cardiopulmonary support, and intra-aortic balloon pumping. A second ablation session was performed 9 days after the first session. The VT was eliminated by RF applications on the infero-septal wall of the LV. No further VTs emerged after the RFA. The patient, however, died from deterioration of his heart failure 12 days after the procedure. A postmortem examination of the heart was performed.\nFigure A shows a cross section of the ablation lesions on the IVS in a four chamber slice, where the ablation lesions from the SURF ablation were assessed. The heart was significantly enlarged and weighed 505 g. The ventricular septum was thin. The yellow arrow heads in Figure A indicate the ablation lesions. The black-colored areas were lesions with hemorrhaging caused by damage to small intramural coronary arteries and capillaries and the adjacent cloudy discolored areas were necrotic tissue caused by the RF energy. The ablation lesions were mainly located on the IVS and inferior wall of the LV. Figure B shows identical histologic sections to those ablation lesions on the IVS in Figure A. The original pathologic fibrosis resulting from the cardiac sarcoidosis extended diffusely onto the IVS. In Figure B, the area surrounded by the blue line was assumed to be the ablation lesions created from the LV endocardium, and the area surrounded by the yellow line was the lesions created from the RV endocardium. Those lesions were contiguous, creating a transmural ablation lesion on the IVS. There was, however, a little spared viable myocardial tissue that escaped the RF energy on the LV endocardial surface (area surrounded by the red dotted line) despite the deeper sites having been completely ablated.\nThere was no active epithelioid granuloma from the sarcoidosis observed in the autopsy.", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'interprets laboratory or other diagnostic study results and identifies current/future status of patient', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "In 2012, a 22-year-old edentulous female patient was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. She had severe class III malocclusion and facial deformity, which included nasal and mandibular deviation to the right. After taking a comprehensive medical and dental history, we noticed that the patient had hypodontia with several impacted teeth due to amelogenesis imperfecta (Figure ).\nIntra-oral clinical examination revealed horizontal discrepancy of alveolar ridge, knife-edge mandibular alveolar ridge, uneven alveolar ridge, and a deep palate (Figure ).\nRoutine radiographic examinations consisting of panoramic radiography and lateral cephalometry were requested. The cephalogram exhibited anterior-posterior discrepancy of the jaw in the horizontal plane and a pseudo-long face.\nFollowing consultation with a prosthodontist, cosmetic surgery was scheduled for the patient to correct her long face, mid-face deficiency, jaw deviation to the right, class III discrepancy, and alveolar ridge deficiency followed by dental implant placement and full mouth prosthetic rehabilitation. After consultation with an orthodontist, it was found that forced eruption of the impacted teeth was not possible; thus, the teeth were extracted under local anesthesia.\nPrimary impressions were made using irreversible hydrocolloid impression material (Kimica, Tokyo, Japan). Special trays were fabricated, and final impression was made by zinc oxide eugenol (Wuhan Xingzhengshun, Hubei, China). Then, the occlusal rims were made to record the inter-arch relationship, and the casts were mounted in a semi-adjustable articulator (Dentatus, New York, USA) in centric relation. The teeth were arranged in class III occlusion, and then they were coated with barium sulfate (Foshan Xinmei Chemical, Guangdong, China) to make them opaque for easy detection of the occlusal line for Epker cephalometric prediction tracing (Figure ).\nThe Epker prediction tracing was performed for preoperative assessments, which included analysis of the maxillary retrognathism, mandibular prognathism, and excess skeletal vertical growth. Sagittal split ramus osteotomy and LeFort I osteotomy were scheduled. According to the data obtained from the lateral cephalogram of the patient and clinical examinations (zygomatic regions, paranasal area, nasolabial, and gonial angles, SNA, SNB, and ANB angles), the surgeon planned a mandibular setback procedure by 7 mm and repositioning of the maxilla by 2 mm superiorly and 5 mm anteriorly on surgical casts. Then, the casts were mounted in this new position and the jaw relations were determined. Posterior teeth were arranged in new articulation and the final dentures were fabricated. The surgeon used these dentures for the edentulous patient as the final surgical splint. Mandibular cast and denture setback by 7 mm relative to its current position and an intermediate stent was fabricated using auto-polymerizing acrylic resin (Kulzer, Newbury, UK). Then, dentures were fabricated as splint and after polishing, several holes were drilled in the base of denture, and the arch bar was bonded to it. Circummandibular wires for the mandible and palatal screws were used to fix the splints to the corresponding jaws. The surgical procedure of the maxilla and mandible was performed using these splints (Figure ).\nAlveolar ridge augmentation was performed by harvesting a graft from the iliac crest. The graft was placed upon a surgical stent and fixed to the external maxillary surfaces with a screw and plate.\nAfter 2 weeks, temporary complete dentures were delivered to the patient. They were adjusted using tissue conditioner (Kerr, USA). Six months later, an impression was made and a radiographic stent was fabricated for implant placement. To determine the proper location for placement of implants, gutta-percha points (VDW, Munich, Germany) were placed at the center of desired teeth in ideal direction of implant, and the outer surfaces of the teeth were coated with barium sulfate (Foshan Xinmei Chemical, Guangdong, China) (Figure ).\nThe patient underwent cone beam computed tomography with stent to determine the proper site of implant placement (Figure ). Proper diagonal length and angle of 16 implants (Dentium, Implantium, Korea, Seoul), eight in each jaw, were determined by stent according to the available bone volume. Implants were inserted using a surgical stent. The temporary complete dentures of patient were relined and delivered to the patient. Three months later, the implants were uncovered, and healing abutments were tightened. Primary impression of the healing was made by alginate (Kimica, Tokyo, Japan). Primary cast was poured. After fabrication of special tray, final impression was made using the open tray technique following splinting of impression copings using polyvinyl siloxane (Zhengzhou Huaer, Henan, China). The final cast was fabricated. Impression verification jig was fabricated in a dental laboratory and was tried in patient's mouth to confirm the accuracy of impression. Next, the record base and wax rims were fabricated. The jaw relations were recorded by rims, and after that the teeth were arranged. The teeth set-up was checked in the mouth. A putty index was made from the arranged teeth and accordingly, proper abutment angle and gingival height were determined.\nThe three-part frames (Degubond, Dentsply sirona prosthetics, U.S.A, Pennsylvania) for the maxilla and mandible were fabricated. Frames were tried in the mouth, and the fit of frames was checked radiographically (Figure ). Porcelain crowns with A2 shade were fabricated. Implant-supported crowns were cemented with a temporary cement (Kerr, Toronto, Canada) (Figure ).

{"clinical_note": "A 38-year-old male underwent a tissue-matched renal allograft transplant for end-stage renal failure secondary to hypertension and primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed 2 years prior to renal transplantation when he developed recurrent episodes of thrombosis of the arteriovenous fistula and neck veins, for which he was started on warfarin. Anticoagulation was optimized prior to surgery by withholding warfarin 5 days before surgery while bridging with heparin. During the early postoperative period (first postoperative week), he developed a peri-renal hematoma (ultrasonography 13 cm \u00d7 7 cm). Noncontrast computed tomography scan detected a homogenous fluid collection posterior to the transplanted kidney which extended superiorly up to the right subhepatic area and inferiorly into the pelvis, displacing the bladder to the left (Figure ). Anticoagulation was then withheld and he recovered over the next few days with normalization of serum creatinine and urine output. Prior to discharge, his urethral catheter and ureteric stent were removed and warfarin was restarted.\nThree weeks after the surgery, he presented with reduced urine output and progressive abdominal distension associated with pain and fever. Ultrasound scan revealed a large perigraft collection. Resuscitation and urgent exploration revealed a viable graft with a large urinoma posterior to the kidney. A possible anastomotic leak was suspected and a passive external drain was placed to allow adequate drainage of urine and healing of the anastomotic site. However, the conservative approach failed and there was no reduction in the drain output. Therefore, surgical exploration and definitive reconstruction were planned.\nSurgical exploration revealed an allograft vascular pedicle in the inferolateral aspect of the graft with a completely sloughed off allograft ureter (Figure ). Sloughed part of the allograft ureter was excised up to the pelviureteric junction where the graft renal pelvis appeared well-perfused and healthy. Free flow of urine from the graft was noted. Ipsilateral native ureter was divided close to the native renal pelvis and approximated to the graft extraperitoneally, posterior to the vas deferens. Allograft pelvis- native ureter ureteropyelostomy was performed over a 6 French double J stent connecting the native ureter and the allograft renal pelvis, essentially similar to the technique described for the Anderson and Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty (Figure ). Recovery following surgery was uneventful with no evidence of obstruction or allograft failure. Six months following surgery, he developed a perirenal abscess around the graft kidney, which was successfully drained. A 99 m-Technetium DTPA (diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate) renography was carried out 9 months after surgery, which showed normal uptake and excretion with no evidence of obstruction (Figure ).

Expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was detected in 80% of the resected lung using an anti-PD-L1 SP142 antibody (Figure C). Although the patient had received adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur/uracil, bilateral adrenal gland metastasis was detected in April 2015. We administered several chemotherapy regimens: carboplatin and paclitaxel (4 cycles); pemetrexed (9 cycles); vinorelbine (8 cycles); and docetaxel (2 cycles). Right adrenal metastasis increased and compressed the inferior vena cava, which caused leg swelling. At that time, CT revealed pleural effusion and pulmonary metastasis (Figure A). We administered nivolumab therapy as the fifth-line therapy in October 2016. After 6 cycles of nivolumab therapy, the right adrenal gland metastasis was reduced, and his swollen legs and performance status improved; however, the pleural effusion and pulmonary metastasis were exacerbated (Figure B). The cytological analysis revealed that malignant cells were not detected and lymphocytes were predominant in pleural effusion. The left ventricular ejection fraction measured by echocardiography was 70% and the brain natriuretic peptide was 9.2 ng/mL (normal range < 18.4 ng/mL). The inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter was 20 \u00d7 8 mm and the respiratory variation in the IVC was more than 50%. Malignant pleural effusion and heart failure were unlikely.

{"clinical_note": "We report a case of 34-year-old woman in her 11th week of pregnancy with recurrent symptomatic refractory SVT who underwent a successful fluoroless ablation.\nHer electrocardiogram (Figure ) demonstrated a long RP SVT with a heart rate of 180 beats per minute. She failed vagal maneuvers and adenosine administration and was started on a Diltiazem and Esmolol drip. Although her rate decreased to 120 beats per minute she became hypotensive. A cardioversion with anesthesia was transiently successful; however, she had shortly a recurrence of her tachycardia. A repeat cardioversion with an amiodarone bolus was also unsuccessful. With sotalol the SVT was no longer incessant, but the patient continued to show frequent long periods of SVT or salvos of premature atrial contractions (PACs). Given her continued instability, she was referred for an electrophysiology study and ablation.\nTo minimize the radiation risk to the fetus we attempted a fluoroless ablation. Three dimensional (3D) electro-anatomical mapping (CARTO 3 Version 4 software, Biosense Webster, Irwindale, California) was created with an irrigated contact force sensing catheter (Figure A). With the right atrial (RA) geometry including the coronary sinus delineated, a steerable decapolar catheter was placed in the coronary sinus (CS) using our map as a reference. Although with sedation the patient was not in tachycardia, she was having frequent salvos of PACs (Figure B) with proximal to distal activation on the CS tracings. The differential for the origin of the tachycardia was thought to be from the right-sided pulmonary veins, superior vena cava (SVC) tachycardia or crista terminalis (CT). The patient therefore had another decapolar catheter placed along the CT with its most distal pole in the SVC. Isoproterenol of 2 mcg/min was administered; however, we could still not induce the tachycardia. Activation mapping of these PACs consistently demonstrated earliest activity on the anterior-superior portion of the CT. At this location, we had poor contact force and therefore the short sheath was exchanged for a Schwartz Right 0 (SR0) sheath. Prior to ablation high output pacing was performed and demonstrated no phrenic nerve capture. With the sheath, we could obtain a contact force between 10-20 g and ablation at 30-35 Watts resulted in immediate termination of the PACs (Figure C).

{"clinical_note": "An 85-year-old man with coronary artery disease (CAD), prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) was admitted with recurrent, unexplained syncope. His baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and telemetry monitoring showed AF with a slow ventricular rate as well as right bundle branch block (RBBB) and left anterior fascicular block (LAFB; Figure A). The QRS duration was 156 milliseconds. Due to concern over paroxysmal AV block or ventricular arrhythmia as the cause of his syncope, electrophysiology (EP) study with possible device implantation was recommended. An octapolar catheter (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA) was positioned near the His-bundle location. Intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) revealed infra-Hisian block at baseline, and there were no inducible ventricular arrhythmias during the EP study (Figure A). Pacing from the His catheter in this location resulted in QRS narrowing, so the decision was made to implant a permanent His-bundle (PHB) pacemaker. The octapolar catheter was left in the His-bundle position as a fluoroscopic marker for PHB lead placement.\nA fixed-curve delivery sheath (His C315, Medtronic, Inc.) was used to direct the PHB lead (Model 3830, Medtronic, Inc.) toward the membranous septum.

High-output unipolar pacing from the PHB lead at this location resulted in a narrow QRS complex (104 milliseconds) with resolution of the RBBB and LAFB (Figure B). However, despite resolution of the conduction abnormalities, intracardiac EGMs on the octapolar catheter revealed that the recorded His-bundle potential was not captured during PHB lead pacing. The octapolar catheter was advanced beyond the PHB lead tip to ensure there was not capture of the distal His bundle (or right bundle branch; Figure A). Recordings from the octapolar catheter in this location revealed antegrade activation of the His bundle, again without capture of this electrogram during pacing (Figure B). Pacing at lower outputs resulted in non-selective His capture with a His threshold of 1.75 V @ 1.0 milliseconds and an RV septal threshold of 0.75 V @ 1.0 milliseconds. The thresholds remained stable, and the patient was discharged the next morning.

{"clinical_note": "A 73-year-old overweight male patient complained about mild right subcostal abdominal pain and deteriorating dyspnea upon exertion. The patient had previously undergone multiple thorax X-rays and was diagnosed with an asymptomatic elevation of his right hemidiaphragm (Figure A). A new thorax X-ray showed persistent right-sided hemidiaphragmatic elevation (Figure B). Physical examination revealed decreased to eliminated right lung base breath sounds. Percussion in this area was evident for a solid mass. Lung or subdiaphragmatic liver tumor was part of the differential diagnosis. Abdominal ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging (thorax-CT, abdominal MRI) revealed a giant subdiaphragmatic hepatic lesion (16 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 9 cm), centrally located in the liver (segments IVa, VIII, VII, and partially IVb and V) (Figures C-E). Serological examinations were negative for viral hepatitis. Alcohol intake was referred to as light to moderate. The suspicion of hepatocellular adenoma was raised. The patient was admitted to our hospital and underwent an atypical central hepatic resection (Figures F,G). His postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged on 8th postoperative day. Histological examination showed a well-differentiated HCC, (pT1) arising from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, resected in clear margin (R0). The patient remains in excellent general condition and recurrence-free 38 months postoperatively.\nProgressive dyspnea can be a frequent finding in geriatric patients due to several causes. On the other hand, dyspnea as a primary symptom due to hemidiaphragm elevation in the context of an underlying liver tumor is extremely rare. Moreover, symptomatic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm should always raise suspicion of a silent hepatic tumor.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

He reported chronic dysphagia and vomiting despite normal postop imaging (upper GI series and CT scan). Patient has lost the foreseen weight at 6 months (50 kg, BMI = 30.86 kg/m2, %EWL = 72.5%), but he presented to our institution 8 months later with a left pleuritic chest pain, nonradiating in nature associated with left shoulder pain, dyspnea, fever, chills, and decrease food intake (he stopped eating well 2 weeks prior to presentation because of described odynophagia and took multiple doses of IV NSAIDS). Upon admission, patient was hypotensive with a deteriorating general status (anxious, nadir GCS was 11, hypotensive, tachycardic) and a bad respiratory status (dyspnea, tachypnea, crackles on physical exam specially in the left side, with decrease left sided air entry). A chest x-ray showed a left massive pleural effusion with left lower lobe consolidation (effusion + pneumonia) (Fig. ). In an effort to explain the cause of the effusion, a CT scan chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast, showed a proximal stomach (gastro-esophageal junction) staple line fistula that was draining to what was first described as a left upper quadrant abscess later found to be a GC fistula causing a left pleural effusion (reactional effusion) (Figs. and ). He had a chest tube placed immediately that drained nonpurulent sero-sanguinous liquid of which one set of culture was taken. He was then started on empiric antibiotics, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin, after cultures were taken and the patient was kept NPO. Four days later, chest tube was removed, and conservative management was continued. Total parenteral nutrition was started because the patient was malnourished, with low serum albumin, low iron, and evident muscular wasting (although he maintained a BMI of 26). Results of new cultures were out and showed no growth. Patient's antibiotics were switched to piperacillin/tazobactam and fluconazole. He was scheduled for a salvage surgery with a laparoscopic esophagogastrectomy with a Roux-en-Y esophagojejunal reconstruction when his nutritional status was adequate enough for the procedure, and after resolution of his infection. Ten days after, a repeat CT scan was done that showed a smaller residual left pleural effusion plus enhancement of the visceral and peritoneal pleura, and persistence of the gastro-colic fistula (Fig. ). GP fistula was excluded and GC fistula was confirmed. Patient was discharged home with a naso-jejunal tube (placed 1 day before discharge) for enteral feeding with high protein shakes (1500 mL Fresubin HP and 10 scoops of Protiphar/day to compensate for his daily caloric needs of 2400 kcal per day) and was kept on PO antibiotics (co-amoxiclav). A total of 14 days of IV antibiotics and another 2 weeks of PO antibiotics were taken. Upon many outpatients\u2019 consultations, the patient family was concerned with the possible risks and benefits of the reoperation that was thoroughly explained to them and to the patient with multiple counseling sessions. They opted to continue conservative treatment (antibiotics + naso-jejunal enteral nutrition) in an attempt for the fistula to resolve without surgery because they feared the possible outcomes. The patient was carefully monitored over the course of 8 weeks with serial CT scans and outpatient visits, and finally on the last CT scan, the GC fistula had completely resolved (Fig. ), with no evidence of pleural effusion and the patient was started on a progressive oral diet after removal of the Naso-Jejunal tube.

On arrival, his vital signs were: Glasgow Coma Scale, E3V4M6; heart rate, 88 b.p.m.; blood pressure, 158/117 mmHg; respiration rate, 15 breaths/min; SpO2, 98% (room air); and body temperature, 36.2\u00b0C. He had no remarkable medical history and did not take medication. Arterial blood gas findings were: pH 7.344; PaCO2, 31.7 mmHg; PaO2, 102 mmHg; , 17.2 mmol/L; BE, \u22128.5 mmol/L. Plasma osmolality was 359 mOsm/kg, the osmolal gap (OG) was 75.8 mOsm/kg, and the anion gap was 13.8 mOsm/kg. Other blood laboratory findings were unremarkable.\nWe hypothesized that the patient had metabolized most of the EtOH because EtOH has a much higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase than MeOH and 12 h had already passed since ingestion of the product. The estimated serum concentration of MeOH (eMeOH) was calculated by 75.8 (OG) \u00d7 3.2 (molecular weight/10) to be 242.6 mg/dL. Given the diagnosis of lethal MeOH poisoning, repeated doses of fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, were given i.v. and hemodialysis (HD) was intermittently carried out twice for 4 h each. After the first round of HD, OG and eMeOH decreased to 23.7 mOsm/kg and 75.8 mg/dL, respectively. During the second round of HD, OG and eMeOH decreased from 11.1 mOsm/kg and 35.5 mg/dL to 1.9 mOsm/kg and 6.0 mg/dL, respectively. As the patient was coherent and did not develop any serious signs or symptoms due to toxic metabolites of MeOH (e.g., vision abnormality), he was discharged on hospital day 4.\nSerum samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Serum concentrations of MeOH and EtOH were measured by headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) (GCMS-QP2020; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Sample injections into GC/MS were carried out using an HS sampler (HS-20; Shimadzu) at 50\u00b0C for 60 min.

{"clinical_note": "A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with nuclear cataract in his right eye about 15 years after myopic LASIK surgery. His corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of the right eye was 0.52 logMAR with the refraction of \u2212 4.50/\u2212 0.75*29. He asked for a FLACS and desired spectacle independence after the IOL implantation. Corneal topography (Pentacam, Oculus Optikgerate GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) showed a uniform, well-centered corneal flap (Fig. ), with a total corneal astigmatism of 0.9D, and a corneal irregular astigmatism of 0.115 \u03bcm. Besides, the 6 mm zone corneal spherical aberration (SA) was 0.392 \u03bcm while the angle kappa was 0.15. After a series of thorough assessments, we decided to implant a multifocal IOL with negative SA. For IOL power calculations, the standard IOLMaster (Carl Zeiss Meditec,Jena, Germany) biometry was performed and the Haigis-L formula was chosen to determine an IOL power of +23D for emmetropia. A steep merdian corneal incision was designed at 140 degree according to the Pentacam results.\nThe LenSx laser system (LenSx Laser; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth,TX, USA) was used to perform the surgery. After the patient\u2019s eye was properly docked to the system, the arc cuts of the primary and side port incision were adjusted towards the limbus, anterior to the conjunctival vascular arcades, under the guided of the LenSx real-time imaging system. A 2.0 mm primary corneal incision (Fig. ), a 1.0 mm side port incision and a 5.0 mm capsulotomy were created by the laser. Nuclear prefragmention was performed to obtain 6 pieces in a cross pattern (Fig. ). Then phacoemulsification was proceeded in a standard stop-and-chop manner with the Stellaris system (Bausch + Lomb Laboratories, Rochester, NY, USA), and an AT Lisa tri 839MP IOL (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) was implanted right afterwards. All surgical procedures were uneventful. The patient was instructed to apply topical dexamethasone tobramycin for 2 weeks and pranoprofen for 1 month postoperatively.\nAnterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec) showed a smooth corneal flap 1 week after FLACS (Fig. ). The distance from the external wound opening to the corneal flap edge was 0.15 mm. At 3 months postoperatively, the IOL was well centered in the capsule (Fig. ). Pentacam showed a uniform corneal flap (Fig. ) with slightly decreased total corneal astigmatism and corneal SA (Table ). Uncorrected visual acuitis were 0.00 LogMAR for distance, 0.10 LogMAR for intermediate at 80 cm, 0.10 LogMAR for near at 40 cm. The defocus curve (Fig. ) showed an optimal visual acuity at -3D apart from 0D, but maintained a functional range of visual acuity across from 0D to \u2212 3.5D with visual acuity no less than 0.22 logMAR. Results of ocular aberrations (OPD Scan, Nidek Co., Ltd.) for 5 mm diameter pupils showed 0.831um of high order aberration (HOA), 0.648um of coma, 0.327um of trefoil, 0.119um of tetrafoil, and 0.311um of SA.

{"clinical_note": "A 59-year-old and overweight man (weight = 87 kg, BMI = 29.75) who suffered from a sleep apnea syndrome, was diagnosed with a stage III mantle cell lymphoma in December 2014. On admission, he presented systemic lymphadenopathy without any bone marrow involvement. Laboratory tests showed normal liver enzymes levels as well as negative hepatitis B and C serological profiles.\nAn oxaliplatin-based polychemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation was proposed. First-line chemotherapy with four cycles of R-DHAX regimen, including rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine and oxaliplatin was administered. After three courses, PET-CT (positron emission tomography) response assessment indicated a complete metabolic response. The patient then received conditioning regimen with BEAM 400, consisting of bicnu (300 mg/m2) for 1 day, etoposide (400 mg/m2) combined to cytarabine (400 mg/m2) for 4 days and melphalan (140 mg/m2) for 1 day prior to autologous HSCT. Anti-infective prophylaxis included valacyclovir and fluconazole, starting on Day \u22127. On March 16th, 2015 (Day 0), 9.8 \u00d7 106 cells CD34+/kg were infused. During this procedure, laboratory data did not display any abnormality, especially hepatic enzymes levels that were within the normal range. Despite antimicrobial therapy with Piperacillin\u2013Tazobactam, the patient had persistent fever over the ensuing 72 h, requiring an empiric antifungal treatment with Voriconazole. No signs of invasive aspergillosis were detected (normal CT-scan) and aspergillus antigenemia were negative. Voriconazole was then replaced by Caspofungin on Day +6. On Day +8, oligoanuria was observed and physical examination revealed hepatomegaly, fluid retention, ascites and weight gain < 5% (i.e. 90 kg, +2 kg/48 h). Additionally, thrombocytopenia refractory to platelet transfusion was noted. On Day +9, the serum transaminase concentration increased in an explosive manner from 75 to 2914 UI/L in the morning and 5046 UI/L in the evening for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and from 45 to 1216 UI/L for alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Similarly, the bilirubin level had reached 67 \u00b5mol/L (N < 21) accompanied with elevated creatinine level shifting from normal value to 230 \u00b5mol/L within 24 h (Fig. ). Alkaline phosphatase levels were initially normal and progressively increased along with SOS/VOD syndrome (2\u00d7 ULN). The patient developed coagulation disorders as revealed by a progressive increase of INR whereas the Factor V remained normal (Fig. ). An elevated level of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) was also noted with a value of 51 UA/mL (N < 16). An abdominal ultrasound was performed and confirmed hepatomegaly, ascites and decreased velocity in the portal venous flow. The subject whose weight increased more than 5% (i.e. 92 kg) was therefore diagnosed with hepatic VOD and was admitted to the Intensive Care unit. A treatment with Defibrotide at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day was immediately initiated.\nBecause of the atypical major increase in transaminases levels, a transvenous liver biopsy was performed on Day +10 and showed a patchy perivenular sinusoidal dilatation and congestion with hepatocyte plate disruption (Fig. ). A second abdominal ultrasound further supported the diagnosis of SOS/VOD with a worsening of doppler parameters, then harboring a reversed hepatic venous flow. Moreover, differential diagnoses such as fulminant viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C and E, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus) were excluded. Despite symptomatic measures along with the maintenance of an adequate fluid balance and ascites removal with albumin infusion, renal failure could not be controlled. Because of anuria, hemodialysis was thus implemented on Day +9.\nNeutrophils recovery was achieved on Day +11 and liver dysfunction gradually improved from Day +13 to Day +15 with decreased transaminases levels ([AST] 408 UI/L; [ALT] 494 UI/L) (Fig. ). Although his overall condition was progressively recovering, the patient presented a sudden hemodynamic instability with an acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanic ventilation, on Day +16. A fulminant liver failure with uncontrolled lactic acidosis was observed. An abdominal CT scan was performed and showed an acute mesenteric ischemia with hepatic and renal ischemic injury.

{"clinical_note": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male was assigned to tolvaptan treatment as part of the TEMPO 3:4 trial in 2008. ADPKD had been diagnosed by ultrasound in 1998, which was performed because of hypertension and a positive family history for ADPKD. DNA analysis later showed a PKD2 mutation. In 2008, serum creatinine level was 94 \u03bcmol/L, with an eGFR of 83 mL/min/1.73m2 as calculated by the CKD-EPI formula []. Total kidney volume (TKV) was 2351 mL, and height adjusted TKV 1292 mL/m, corresponding to MAYO risk class 1D []. Urine showed microalbuminuria (albumin: creatinine ratio 4.75 g/mmol). Pre-tolvaptan, his 24-h urine volume was 1300 mL.\nIn that same year, tolvaptan was initiated and uptitrated to the maximum dose of 120 mg per day (90/30 mg) within three weeks. After completion of the TEMPO 3:4 trial, tolvaptan was stopped for one month. Thereafter tolvaptan was re-started as part of a compassionate use program. In 2015 this patient developed hypertension despite use of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (losartan 100 mg q.d.) and a beta-blocker (metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d.). Previously an alpha-blocker and a calcium antagonist had led to intolerable side-effects. Therefore HCT was started at a dose of 12.5 mg q.d. that was well-tolerated, and was later increased to 25 mg q.d.\nUrinary volumes before and during tolvaptan treatment are shown in Fig. . In 2011, this patient collected 24-h urine once during the month in which tolvaptan was temporarily stopped. At that time urine volume was 1280 mL and urine osmolality 632 mOsm/kg.

After initiation of HCT (12.5 mg q.d.) 24-h urine production declined to 2878 mL, while urine osmolality increased to 290 mOsm/kg. After the increase of HCT to 25 mg q.d. the last 24-h urine collection measured 2699 mL and 280 mOsm/kg. Mean 24-h urine volume had declined during HCT co-treatment by 2078 mL (43%).\n24-h creatinine excretion was used to verify whether urine collections were complete, assuming unchanged muscle mass over time creatinine excretion should be similar between urine collections. Mean 24-h creatinine excretion before start of HCT was 18.1 mmol/24 h, and after start of HCT 16.7 mmol/24 h, indicating no difference in urine collected.\nDuring the nine-year treatment period, serum electrolytes were measured 37 times and stayed within the normal range during the whole period. These electrolytes include potassium (range 3.9\u20134.6 mmol/L), sodium (range 136\u2013144 mmol/L) and calcium (range 2.34\u20132.57 mmol/L). There were no differences in average electrolyte concentration between the period with tolvaptan monotherapy and the period with tolvaptan-HCT combination therapy.\neGFR declined from 83 mL/min/1.73m2 in 2008 to 57 mL/min/1.73m2 in 2017 (Fig. ).

{"clinical_note": "A 76-year-old woman had an 8-year history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and severe TR. Her history included mild hypothyroidism and right upper lobectomy for lung carcinoma 11 years previously. For 2 years, she had complained of shortness of breath when lying in the left lateral decubitus position. She had felt dyspnea after mild exercise for 9 months. Recently, she had a sense of abdominal fullness. Although administration of diuretics was started, her symptoms did not completely improve, and she was referred to our department for surgical treatment. The follow-up chest X-ray showed a gradually protruding right-side shadow of the cardiac silhouette, and the cardiothoracic ratio on the chest X-ray reached 88% (Fig. ). The electrocardiogram showed AF with low fibrillatory wave amplitude. Echocardiography showed an enlarged right ventricular (RV) cavity and mild paradoxical motion of the ventricular septum. The tricuspid valve had no findings of an organic and constructive abnormality, with no severe tethering. The annular size of the tricuspid valve was 50 mm, and the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was 21 mm (Table ). Repeated preoperative cardiac catheterization showed slightly elevated wedge pressure with mild pulmonary hypertension, although LV function was preserved with a cardiac index of 4.0 (Table ). There was no L-R shunt disease. Computed tomography (CT) findings showed that the maximum size of the RA reached 121 mm (Fig. ). The change in dimension of the RA by CT showed that the size of the RA increased with time (Fig. ). Blood tests showed no liver dysfunction.\nSurgery was performed via median sternotomy. The pericardium was extremely thin on the RA side without any defect. There was no adherence in the pericardial cavity. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established by ascending aorta cannulation with bicaval drainage. The RA was extremely thin and the tricuspid valve annulus was enlarged, with a diameter of 55 mm, but there was no tricuspid structural abnormality. Tricuspid annuloplasty was performed on the beating heart using a 28-mm Carpentier-Edwards Physio tricuspid annuloplasty ring (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). Plication of the enlarged RA was performed, mainly at the interatrial septum, the free RA wall, including the appendage, and the space between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid ring, in addition to the free RA wall, including the appendage (Fig. ). Additionally, closure of the left atrial appendage from the outside was performed to prevent left atrial thrombus formation. All procedures were performed on the beating heart. The postoperative course was uneventful. The pathological findings of the RA wall demonstrated thinning of the myocardium, inflammatory cell infiltrate, and few cardiomyocytes (Figs. , ). Postoperative X-ray and CT showed reduced cardiac silhouette and RA volume (Figs. , ). Postoperative echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 58% and mild TR with a pressure gradient of 29 mmHg (Table ). The postoperative value of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) decreased after the operation.

{"clinical_note": "The deceased donor was a 67-year-old man with a kidney Doppler ultrasound (DUS) that was negative for any nodular lesion. As part of the routine postoperative follow-up management, the recipient underwent DUS to assess the patency of the graft on postoperative day 1. The DUS finding was suspicious for an acute arterial thrombosis but did not reveal any focal irregularities. Consequently, a computed tomography (CT) scan was urgently obtained but it did not show any arterial complications. However, it serendipitously revealed a 2.4-cm lesion on the upper pole of the renal allograft which was not detected during the back-table or ultrasonography monitoring. A biopsy of the lesion was performed, and its histology revealed an epithelial proliferation of large cells with finely granular cytoplasm and medium round nucleus vesicular acidophilus, arranged tubules, and alveoli and cords immersed in a connective tissue stroma. This picture was consistent with oncocytoma. However, because the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may morphologically resemble renal oncocytoma, immunohistochemical staining was performed using Ki-67 antibodies and RCC antigens. The results were negative, ruling out chromophobe RCC. The therapeutic options and potential related outcomes were clearly discussed with the patient. Given the low risk of malignant transformation in an oncocytoma [], we found no reason for resection of the lesion or an allograft nephrectomy. Consequently, we opted for active surveillance of the benign tumor with ultrasonography, every 2 months, for the first year and, then, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), every year (Fig. ). The patient received mycophenolate-mofetil, tacrolimus, and prednisone throughout the 5-year follow-up period and the regimen for immunosuppression was not changed despite the presence of the renal mass.

After the third dose of the anti-PD1 antibody (30 days from initial treatment), the patient developed massive proteinuria (5.47 g/day) with normal serum albumin and creatinine levels (35.3 g/L and 68 \u03bcmol/L, respectively). The treatment was suspended and proteinuria was monitored regularly. His urine protein excretion decreased to 0.47 g/day and further to 0.1 g/day on days 30 and 37, respectively, following the final dose of anti-PD1 antibody. However, 2 weeks later, urine protein excretion increased to 3.21 g/day, and to 30 g/day following an additional 14 days. The patient denied receiving administration of any additional drugs during this period and was admitted for further evaluation. Upon admission, his blood pressure was 110/75 mmHg with moderate pitting edema of both lower limbs. Laboratory tests revealed hypoalbuminemia (21 g/L), normal serum creatinine (80 \u03bcmol/L), and elevated total serum cholesterol (6.58 mmol/L).

He was also followed for triple-bypass surgery for coronary disease in 2010. No family history of hematological malignancies was noted. Initially, he was hospitalized in an intensive care unit for grade IV anemia at 5.5 g/dl. After blood transfusions, he was admitted in our hematology department. Bone marrow aspiration showed multilineage dysplasia with 8% of blasts (Fig. ), consistent with a diagnosis of MDS with excess blasts: refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1). A karyotype analysis identified trisomy 13. Immunophenotypic evaluation showed the presence of CD34+, CD117+, cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase (CMPO+), and CD33\u2212 cells. Plasma folate, vitamin B12, iron, and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were normal. No inflammatory syndrome was found. He was initially treated with darbepoetin 300 \u03bcg per week, without response.\nTwo months later, because of a worsening of cytopenia, a second bone marrow aspiration was performed.

A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study confirmed the presence of the solid, intracavitary mass.\nA cardiac biopsy via catheterization was not conclusive regarding the precise nature of the lesion. After informed consent, the patient underwent surgery. Intraoperatively, a whitish mass, 3 \u00d7 4 cm, non-adherent to the wall, was found in the right atrium after median sternotomy and atriotomy (Fig. ). Through the tricuspid valve, the mass extended without discontinuity into the right ventricle, adhering to the septal surface of the leaflet and infiltrating the adjacent interventricular septum, in its medial and superior portion. The exophytic intraatrial and intraventricular components were removed. Since intraoperative frozen-section on tissue from the infiltrated septum confirmed the clinical suspect of malignancy, no further surgery was attempted. Definitive histological examination showed a malignant neoplasm characterized by epithelial cells, positive for cytokeratin, forming glandular structures, admixed with a spindle cell component (Fig. -). A final diagnosis of biphasic synovial sarcoma was also confirmed by molecular demonstration of an SYT-SSX1 transcript.\nComputed tomography scan (CT) and cardiac MRI, performed one month after surgery, prompted administration of chemotherapy (ifosfamide/mesna, 4 cycles/3 months) due to increase of the residual ventricular tumor.

She was treated with meropenem and vancomycin for 15 days. Despite treatment, she developed increased fever (40 \u00b0C), persistent cough and general malaise. Her respiratory condition deteriorated and she was transferred to our hospital. Prior to hospitalization, she had been healthy and had developed normally. She had no immunodeficiency and no history of contact with anyone suffering from TB.\nPhysical examination on admission showed a child with a weight of 10 kg, body temperature of 38.5 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 79/41 mmHg, and a heart rate of 157 beats/min. Her weight was reduced from 11 kg (25th percentile) to 10 kg (10th percentile) over the past month alone. Immediately after admission, tracheal intubation was performed because of severe dyspnea, and she was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Arterial blood gas analysis in the PICU showed PaO2 of 60 mmHg, PaCO2 of 59 mmHg, and pH 7.27 under mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 1.0, which resulted in a PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio of 60 mmHg and an oxygenation index (OI) of 29 (Table ).

The results of a rapid influenza test were negative. Genomes of mycobacterium TB and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were detected in tracheal lavage fluid (TLF) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rPCR) assay. Acid fast bacilli smear and culture were both positive. She was diagnosed as having severe ARDS that developed from TB pneumonia, and the standard anti-tuberculous drugs: rifampicin, 15 mg/kg/day; isoniazid, 10 mg/kg/day; pyrazinamide, 30 mg/kg/day; ethambutol, 20 mg/kg/day were administered. We also used colistin and levofloxacin for not only nosocomial infection, but also mycoplasma infection, which we could not rule out. However, her respiratory and circulatory conditions deteriorated despite high-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFO), vasopressor support (noradrenaline at 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/min), and administration of 1 g/kg of immunoglobulin.

For the treatment of DIC, 380 U/kg of rTM was administered as an intravenous drip infusion for 6 consecutive days. After administration of rTM was completed, OI gradually decreased, and the mechanical ventilation mode was changed from HFO to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (Fig. ). DIC score also gradually decreased. We measured plasma levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycan end products (sRAGE) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) before and after rTM administration, because increased levels of sRAGE and HMGB-1 are associated with death in patients with ARDS []. After administration of rTM, HMGB-1 and sRAGE decreased (Fig. ), and inflammatory biomarkers, including interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), also decreased (Fig. ). Throughout the administration of rTM, there was no bleeding-related and other adverse event. Although severe ARDS (P/F ratio \u2266 100 mmHg) was sustained for 19 days, the patient\u2019s OI and P/F ratio improved gradually (Fig. ), and she was extubated on the 27th day after admission. Although there was still a diffuse pattern in the chest X-ray just after extubation (Fig. ), her fever went down and her respiratory condition was stable (P/F ratio: 325, OI: 3).

Her troponin I, CK level in the blood (CK-MB), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were elevated (troponin T, 0.879 ng/mL [normal value: \u22640.016 ng/mL]; CK-MB, 253 U/L [normal value: \u22645 U/L]; BNP, 1513 pg/mL [normal value: \u226418.4 pg/mL]). Chest radiography showed a normal cardiac size, pulmonary congestion, and pleural effusion in the right lung only (Fig. ). Echocardiography showed a dilated, spherical ventricle with reduced systolic function (left ventricle ejection fraction [LVEF], 17%) and pericardial effusion (Fig. ).\nCardiac catheterization on day 3 revealed high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (22 mmHg) and a low cardiac index (2.0 L/min/m2). Coronary angiography showed no abnormalities. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) was performed via the right internal jugular vein, and five specimens were obtained from the right ventricle side of the interventricular septum. Endomyocardial biopsy findings showed lymphocyte infiltration of the myocardium and intranuclear inclusions, which was confirmed as acute myocarditis (Fig. ). In response, intravenous administration of dobutamine (4 \u03bcg/kg/min) was started on day 3. The patient\u2019s systolic blood pressure increased to approximately 100 mmHg and stabilized, and dobutamine administration was gradually tapered off. On day 10, echocardiography showed normalization of LVEF to 71%, dobutamine was stopped, and laboratory findings were almost normalized as follows: CPK, 143 U/L (standard values: 40\u2013150 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 36 U/L (standard values: 11\u201330 U/L); and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 278 U/L (standard values: 4\u201330 U/L). Laboratory findings on day 18 were normalized as follows: CPK, 123 U/L; AST, 18 U/L; ALT, 21 U/L, and BNP, 18 pg/mL. She was eventually discharged on day 19 of her hospital stay.\nOne serum sample for viral serological testing was collected before the EMBs were obtained. Follow-up serum samples were collected between 2 weeks, 1 month, and 6 months after the initial serum sample. The presence of HSV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) was detected upon admission to our hospital, increased at 2 weeks, and returned to normal 6 months later. Additionally, HSV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) increased from hospital admission to 2 weeks (Table ). Other viral serologic tests, including HIV, were negative (Table ). Based on this finding, we diagnosed the patient with acute myocarditis combined with hepatitis arising from HSV infection.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

The appearance was most likely correlated with a submucosal tumor and less likely to be an extrinsic compression. At pathology, colonoscopic biopsies of the mass showed normal colonic mucosa. Laboratory examination showed no anemia (hb 13.2 g/dL) was negative for CEA tumor marker (CEA 2.2 \u03bcg/L). Abdominal computed tomography scan (CT scan) revealed a well-circumscribed hypervascular anterior cecal wall mass (Fig. ) with no liver metastases and no other distant lesions. The mass had no metabolic activity on either FDG-PET scan or on Octreo-PET (Fig. , ).\nAfter multidisciplinary team discussion, a differential diagnosis of mesenchymal tumor of the colon (GIST, leiomyoma, and leiomyosarcoma) was suggested and we decided to perform an exploratory surgery. The patient was consented for open exploration by mini-laparotomy and possible right hemi-colectomy. The right colon was mobilized at the white line of Toldt, the 3 cm white cecal mass was well circumscribed, and a wedge resection, including the appendix, using GIA 75 (Ethicon Endo-Surgery GIA; 75 mm; Guaynabo, Puerto Rico 00969 USA) was performed. The operative specimen was sent for frozen section at pathology. The temporary diagnosis was a benign spindle cell tumor. The intra-operative decision was to wait for the definitive histopathologic examination report in order to try to avoid a right hemicolectomy. The final pathology report revealed a benign spindle cell tumor that stained negative for CD117 and DOG-1 and was diagnosed as cecal schwannoma with a reactive lymph node (Fig. ).\nThe post-operative course was uneventful and the patient started oral feeding the same night and was discharged on day 5 with pain killers.

He was diagnosed with a coronoid process fracture, Regan-Morrey type 2. He was young, highly active, and wanted an early return to normal life; therefore, we performed a minimally invasive arthroscopic osteosynthesis 7 days after the injury.\nSurgery was performed under general anaesthesia with the patient in the prone position. We confirmed the fracture site through the anterolateral portal (). A shaver and radiofrequency probe were used to remove any clots and debris. The radiofrequency probe allowed us to reduce the amount of bone fragment entering the fracture bed. Under fluoroscopic control, a guide pin for a cannulated cancellous screw (CCS) was inserted from the posterior ulnar shaft into the coronoid fragment (). We fixed the fracture with a 3.5 mm CCS and two 1.5 mm K-wires, whilst confirming the anatomical reduction arthroscopically (). After fixation, we confirmed a good reduction position and sufficient stability upon examination. We also confirmed a reduction by radiographs (). Postoperatively, he wore an immobilizing splint for 1 week and then began physical therapy to increase the range of motion.

He underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy, resulting in complete pathologic remission. On examination, patient was afebrile with a heart rate of 136 bpm, blood pressure of 122/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and O2 saturation of 98% on room air. Heart sounds were muffled. Heart rhythm was irregularly irregular. Distention of the jugular veins was observed and Kussmaul's sign was present. Although pulsus paradoxus was not observed, other physical findings were extremely concerning for cardiac tamponade. Bibasilar crackles were present on lung auscultation. Laboratory data was remarkable for a creatinine of 1.42 (baseline of 1.08) and international normalized ratio (INR) of 3.6 (on warfarin for a history of pulmonary embolism). His complete blood counts and electrolytes were normal. His electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and electrical alternans. Chest radiograph showed enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.\nDue to high clinical suspicion for cardiac tamponade, a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was obtained which showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right ventricle, suggestive of cardiac tamponade, as well as mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction (see Figures and ). Patient's INR was reversed to <1.5 and he underwent emergent subxiphoid pericardial window with the removal of 700 ml of turbid, dark, bloody pericardial fluid.

He explained that five days prior to presentation, he began experiencing squeezing abdominal pain, rated 4/10 localized to his RUQ with no radiation. He reported associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and intermittent fever. The patient reported that he had initially thought he had the \u201cstomach flu.\u201d He had tried oral rehydration and Tylenol with no improvement in symptoms since onset. He reported continual progression of symptoms with minimal resolution in abdominal pain, episodes of vomiting, or diarrhea. He denied any change in diet, change in eating habits, recent travel, jaundice, tea-colored urine, itching, recent skin, and soft tissue infection. He stated that he was a previous smoker but quit since being incarcerated two years ago. He denied any alcohol or illicit drug use. He denied having any current sexual partner. He also denied any family history of illnesses or malignancy. On physical examination, patient was normotensive, tachycardic, and febrile on presentation with temperature recorded as 103.7F. Patient appeared weak and diaphoretic and had moderate right upper quadrant tenderness with no rebound tenderness or mass palpated and no other pertinent abdominal findings. Examination of the other systems revealed no abnormalities. The patient was admitted for further work-up of his condition given presentation from prison.\nInitial laboratory results showed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin of 9.8, MCV 81.1), white blood cell count of 15.6 with significant left shift, sodium of 137 mmol/L (reference value 136-145 mmol/L), and potassium of 3.4 mmol/L (3.5-5.1 mmol/L) with normal renal function. Other significant labs on presentation included alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 30 U/L (12-78 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 43 U/L (15-37 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 240 U/L (45-117 U/L), total bilirubin of 1.5 mg/dL (0.2-1.0 mg/dL), albumin of 1.4 g/dL (3.4-5.0 g/dL), and total protein 5.8 g/dL (6.3-9.0 g/dL). Rapid influenza testing was negative. Urine drug screen resulted as negative. Blood cultures from two peripheral sites were collected. Chest X-ray was significant for bibasilar infiltrates with bilateral pleural effusions noted. Given the clinical condition with concern for intra-abdominal source of infection, a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast was performed. This showed a large multiloculated right hepatic mass, measuring 8.4cm with soft tissue mass extension into the upper pole of the right kidney (), unremarkable findings in the gallbladder, bowel, and appendix.\nIn the Emergency department, the patient was initially started on aggressive hydration with 0.9% normal saline given initial presentation prior to work-up. Ceftriaxone 1g Intravenous (IV) route and Metronidazole 500mg Intravenous (IV) route were administered in the emergency department. Blood cultures obtained from two peripheral sites resulted as gram-positive cocci with time to positivity about 15 hours. Patient was started on intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin 1g IV q12 hours and Meropenem 1g IV q8 hours, the initial choice of therapy. Antibiotic sensitivity resulted in day two of admission as MSSA. Antibiotic therapy was narrowed down to Intravenous Nafcillin on day two of admission. Interventional radiology department was consulted for image guided percutaneous drainage of the liver abscess on day one of admission. Two abdominal drains were placed with initial return of 150ml of serosanguinous fluid. Fluid obtained from the CT-guided aspiration was sent to the laboratory for gram stain and culture. The culture obtained from percutaneous catheter drainage resulted as MSSA on day two of admission. The source of MSSA bacteremia was confirmed as pyogenic liver abscess and Nafcillin IV therapy was continued with no change in antibiotic management. Abdominal drains were removed on day six of admission as output remained minimal.\nThe patient was found to have bilateral pleural effusions. Given significant right sided pleural effusion, thoracentesis was performed on day two of admission with 1.2L of pleural fluid removed. Fluid was not sent for studies. Patient also developed nonoliguric acute kidney injury with creatinine rise from 0.7mg/dl (reference value 0.7-1.3 mg/dL) on admission to 1.7 mg/dL on day four of admission. Work-up was consistent with an intrinsic etiology of the acute kidney injury. The etiology was clinically suspected to be secondary to acute tubular injury due to sepsis. The patient was encouraged to continue per oral intake and intravenous fluids were given. Creatinine trended back to patient's baseline while on Nafcillin IV therapy. Repeat blood cultures obtained on day four of admission were consistently growing MSSA. Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and it showed no evidence of intracardiac vegetations and no abnormalities. Repeat blood cultures on day six of admission were negative. A mid-line catheter was inserted in the patient's right upper extremity for vascular access on discharge for continued antibiotic therapy. The patient was discharged after 10 days with continued Nafcillin IV therapy for four weeks postdate of negative blood cultures.\nThe patient was followed up in the general surgery clinic one month after discharge. At this time, he had completed IV antibiotic therapy. Follow-up revealed stable clinical condition as patient reported resolution of symptoms and return to baseline functional status. Laboratory findings indicated normal renal function.

She was not on any contraceptive method and did not report any dyspareunia or urinary symptoms. Her first miscarriage occurred 11 years and was surgically managed by dilatation and curettage. Subsequently she noted changes in her menstrual cycle. Her menstrual cycle became irregular with a heavy flow for 10 days associated with severe dysmenorrhea and bowel symptoms of bloating and diarrhea. She used tranexamic acid one gram three times a day during her menses for the heavy prolonged periods and Mefenamic Acid 500 milligrams three times a day for the dysmenorrhea with reported relief of the symptoms.\nThe physical examination was unremarkable except for mild tenderness in the suprapubic region; she had grossly normal external genitalia and normal looking cervix.\nHer initial hormonal profile was as follows:FSH: 4.5 IU/m (3.1-7.9 IU/L) LH: 10 IU/L (1-18 IU/L)\nShe had a recent pap smear one year ago that was normal.\nTransabdominal and transvaginal (TVS) scans had shown separate right and left cornu with multiple cysts in the peripheral ovarian parenchyma features suggestive of bicornuate uterus and polycystic ovaries (). She also had a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) that was reported to have a uterus opacified with banana configuration oriented to the right with no delineation of fallopian tubes, findings suggestive of a unicornuate uterus.\nHer past medical history was not significant. She was recently divorced, a condition she attributed to her history of several miscarriages in the context of an African cultural expectation of siring children.\nShe was subsequently scheduled her for hysteroscopy and diagnostic laparoscopy. She also gave consent for possible open Strassmans metroplasty.\nOn hysteroscopy, a normal looking endometrium was visualized with a right sided tubal ostia and a small tubal ostia on the left that did not appear patent (). Laparoscopically, a bicornuate uterus was found () with associated endometriosis at the vesicouterine fold. Open metroplasty was done (Figures and ). A fundal transverse incision was made and dissection done to the level of the endometrium after injection of subserosal vasopressin. Apposition of the two horns was done and the uterus sutured in layers (Figures and ). A copper intrauterine device was left in situ to separate the uterine walls and possibly reduce the chances of uterine synechiae though the evidence for this practice is still not conclusive. In addition, endometriotic deposits discovered at the vesico uterine fold were ablated.\nShe had an unremarkable follow-up after surgery with no complications reported.\nA HSG 6 months after surgery revealed unification of the uterine horns but both tubes were not delineated.\nPatient was lost to follow-up but two years later she presented having conceived spontaneously and a TVS revealed a single intrauterine pregnancy at 13 weeks. Her antenatal workup was as highlighted in .\nShe was subsequently followed up at the antenatal clinic and had no concerns till 33 weeks when she presented with a history of lower abdominal pain worsening over the past few weeks and right sided fundal tenderness pain score of seven out of ten on the pain assessment scale. The main concern at the time of assessment was possible uterine rupture. She did not have any features suggestive of bowel obstruction as she was passing stool and bowel sounds were present. She had a normal NST and an obstetric ultrasound that was done showed a single intrauterine pregnancy with normal biophysical profile and no features of placental abruption or slower uterine segment site dehiscence. She had no other investigations done at this time. The pain was significant enough to warrant an admission for which she subsequently received antenatal steroids for lung maturity and opioid analgesia for pain relief. However, the pain did not completely resolve and she underwent a caesarean delivery at 33 weeks and 5 days due to persistent lower abdominal pain. The outcome was a live male infant with a birth weight of 1950 grams and APGAR of 9, 10, 10.

{"clinical_note": "A 70-year-old woman presented in November 2017 to the Emergency Department at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Sweden, due to the rapid onset of fever, shivers, and a suspected skin infection. She had a previous medical history of left-sided ductal breast cancer with lymph node involvement in 1999, which was treated chronologically with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, partial mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, and radiation therapy. In addition, in 2001, a right-sided localised ductal breast cancer in situ was identified and was treated surgically with a partial mastectomy. Secondary to her lymph node dissection, she developed lymphoedema of her left arm, which had been continuously treated with compression stockings. The patient was on treatment with an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker due to hypertension, and in addition, she had a known systolic murmur, characterized as physiological, as transthoracic echocardiographs in 2011 and 2017 were normal. Since her surgery in 1999, on a total of six occasions prior to her last and seventh visit, of which the first episode occurred in 2008, she had been treated for erysipelas in her left upper arm. The presentation had always been sudden with spiking fever and erythema spreading in approximately the same localisation. Interestingly, on all three out of the three occasions where a blood culture has been drawn on presentation with erysipelas, the cultures have shown growth of a bacterium belonging to the S. mitis group. These first two isolates also had similar MIC values for penicillin of 0.064 and 0.125 mg/L, for vancomycin of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, and for gentamicin of 2 and 2 mg/L (). In addition, they were both sensitive to clindamycin.\nOn the present visit, she once again had a sharply demarcated, warm, swollen, and painful erythema measuring approximately 7 \u00d7 15 cm in the lymphoedematous area on her left upper arm. No local portal of bacterial entry was found. Vital parameters showed a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, O2 saturation of 96% on room air, heart rate of 80 beats/min, and blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg. On physical examination, a grade II systolic murmur was heard with punctum maximum I2 dexter. She had no signs of septic emboli, oral examination showed no signs of infection, and examination of lymph nodes was normal. Possibly due to her quick presentation, that is, less than 6 hours from the onset of symptoms, her laboratory results were normal with a white blood cell count of 8.4 \u2217 109/L, platelets of 263 \u2217 109/L, and hemoglobin of 147 g/L. Her CRP was 12 mg/L. She was clinically diagnosed with erysipelas, and due to previous bacteraemia with the S. mitis group in relation to erysipelas and the presence of a systolic murmur, blood cultures were drawn and she was treated with one dose of intravenous penicillin (3g\u22485 million IU) followed by an oral penicillin (1g\u22481.6 million IU) three times daily, for seven days. Once again, now for the third time, the two blood cultures showed growth of a bacterium belonging to the S. mitis group. The MIC value for penicillin was 0.125 mg/L, for vancomycin 1 mg/L, and for gentamicin 16 mg/L (). Similar to the two previous isolates, it was also sensitive to clindamycin. Her treatment was prolonged for 10 days, and a follow-up visit was arranged. Repeat blood cultures were drawn 14 days after discontinuation of antibiotics and they were negative. To prevent further infections, she has once again been referred to the lymphoedema outpatient clinic as well as to the dentist office. On follow-up, thereafter, the patient had no sequelae to her infection, and she gave informed consent for this case report to be published.\nThe three blood isolates, one analysed in 2015 and two in 2017 (15 and 8 months apart), were initially subgrouped to S. mitis/S. oralis/S. pseudopneumoniae of the S. mitis group by combining the MALDI-TOF MS results (MALDI Biotyper, Bruker) with the information that the three stains were resistant to optochin. To allow a more detailed comparison, the three stored isolates were reanalysed and now ethanol/formic acid extractions were performed on the strains, and the updated and improved Bruker MALDI Biotyper database (DB-7311 MSP Library) was used for the MALDI Biotyper analysis. In addition to the standard log (score), weighted list (scores) was also calculated []. S. mitis was the best match for both the first and second isolates when both log (score) and list (score) were calculated. For the third isolate, the best match was S. oralis for both types of scores (). Next, the mass spectra of the three isolates were inspected manually. All three strains showed the specific peak 6839.1 m/z which is associated with S mitis and S. oralis strains, but only the third isolate showed the specific peak 5822.5 m/z which is associated with S. oralis () []. In addition, no peak profiles typical for S. pneumoniae and S. pseudopneumoniae could be detected in the three isolates [, ]. These results further support that the first two isolates are S. mitis and the third isolate is S. oralis. Many differences were seen in the mass spectra of the third isolate (S. oralis) compared to the first two (S. mitis). On the other hand, no clear differences in the spectra between the first and second isolate could be seen, and one can therefore not exclude that they belong to the same clone.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 79-year-old man with a past medical history significant for hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage IV, dementia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented to the Emergency Department after being transferred from a correctional facility due to low hemoglobin found on routine labs. On arrival, his vital signs included a temperature of 36.5\u00b0C, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 22/min, blood pressure of 159/70 mmHg, and saturation of 99% on room air. Physical examination was notable for dry oral mucosa and poor dentition, a 2/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border, and hematomas on both posterior shoulders, bilateral upper arms, and the right medial forearm. The only medication the patient was taking at the time was amlodipine 10 mg daily for hypertension. Upon admission, the patient was agitated and hostile to interview and was thus treated with Haldol 5 mg IM x1. Laboratory studies were performed and showed a hemoglobin level of 6.9 g/dL (decreased from his baseline: 10 g/dL), elevated BUN at 99 mmol/L, and creatinine of 3.23 mg/dL (increased from his baseline creatinine: 2.7 mg/dL).\nHe denied any symptoms associated with anemia such as lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, or hematemesis. He stated that he was unsure if there was melena because he does not routinely inspect his stool. He was initially started on intravenous fluids and given red blood cell transfusion. Immediately after transfusion, his hemoglobin increased to 7.5 g/dL; however, hemoglobin levels continued dropping on subsequent days with the lowest level at 4.6 g/dL. As a result, the patient required a total of 6 packed red blood cell transfusions. After continued intravenous hydration and transfusions, BUN and creatinine decreased to 57 mmol/L and 2.3 mg/dL, respectively. Occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was suspected due to consistent downtrending hemoglobin refractory to blood transfusions. The patient became more cooperative on subsequent days and complained of lower left quadrant abdominal pain as well as chronic bilateral leg pain. The fecal occult blood test was performed and was positive both times. CT abdomen () was performed to rule out intra-abdominal causes of acute anemia and showed right perinephric and right paracolic gutter fat stranding surrounding the right iliopsoas muscle which was asymmetrically enlarged without evidence of definite hyperdense intramuscular hematoma, but possible intramuscular hemorrhage or myositis.\nThe gastroenterology team was consulted, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed. EGD did not yield any abnormal results, but colonoscopy revealed terminal ileum containing hematin (altered blood/coffee-ground-like material) without a clear source of bleeding (). Coagulation studies were subsequently performed which showed an elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) at 101.5 seconds. Hematology service was consulted and a mixing study was ordered, which showed only partial correction of the aPTT, suggesting the possibility of a coagulation factor-specific antibody. Levels of factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII were ordered and showed factor VIII activity of <0.01 unit/mL, factor IX activity of 0.80 unit/mL, factor XI activity of 0.40 unit/mL, and factor XII activity of 0.34 unit/mL. Subsequently, the Bethesda assay was performed to measure autoantibody levels against any of these factors and showed an elevated factor VIII inhibitor level at 390 U/mL, which confirmed the diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A. The patient was started on cyclophosphamide 50 mg QD and dexamethasone 20 mg QD to inhibit the body's immune response against factor VIII. Inhibitor levels decreased to 280 U/mL after 10 days of therapy. Etiology of the patient's acquired factor VIII inhibitor was unclear, so tumor markers (PSA, CEA, CA 19-9) and CT scans (thorax and abdominopelvic) were ordered in order to rule out the underlying malignancy. All markers and imaging were within normal limits. Hemoglobin remained stable at 8 g/dL after starting appropriate treatment. Because throughout the next few weeks, the inhibitor level did not decrease greatly in response to cyclophosphamide therapy, the patient was started on weekly infusions of rituximab. The most recent factor VIII inhibitor level was down to 70.4 U/mL with stable hemoglobin at 13.2 g/dL. Hematology continues to closely monitor the quantity of the inhibitor levels and his response to treatment. In addition, the patient is advised to avoid any activity in which he may sustain trauma or fall due to his increased risk of bleeding.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 13-month-old female presented to the emergency department for urinary retention. She was born at 35 weeks gestation in Mexico with an unknown postnatal hospital course. She was known to have mild gross motor developmental delay diagnosed several months before; caregivers stated that she pulled to stand but did not cruise or walk and babbled but did not have any words. She had no additional past medical history or previous surgeries and no known previous trauma. Upon presentation, the adoptive parents with whom she has lived since very early in her life provided the history. Adoptive parents reported about 2 weeks of fussiness and decreased ability to bear weight on her lower extremities. Parents denied any known trauma at that time. Her weight was <3rd percentile with a Z score of \u22123.36. She was thin appearing but without signs of dehydration or malnourishment. Examination was notable for 0/5 strength, hypotonia, and areflexia in the bilateral lower extremities as well as hypotonia of the trunk. In addition, she was found to have significant head lag and very severe thoracic kyphosis or gibbus deformity. The patient was first evaluated by outpatient urology after referral from the primary care office for urinary retention. A renal ultrasound was performed and was notable for bilateral moderate hydronephrosis and bladder distension. She was sent to the emergency department for further workup. Laboratory studies in the emergency department yielded normal creatinine for age at 0.3 mg/dl, and urine culture obtained by in and out bladder catheterization grew >100,000 CFU/mL of Enterococcus faecalis. Complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable, and thyroid stimulating hormone was within normal range. The patient's creatinine kinase was >1200 U/L, six times the upper limit of normal. Spinal CT demonstrated complete retrospondylolisthesis of T12 vertebra (). MRI was also performed and showed marked compression of the spinal cord resulting in inability to visualize the cord at the level to T12 with surrounding cord edema (). Brain MRI was without abnormality. This imaging also revealed multiple rib fractures in different stages of healing. Dedicated osseous survey showed numerous right and left posterior rib fractures. Liver function tests, lipase, amylase, phosphorous, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D were obtained to rule out congenital or acquired reasons for predisposition for bony fractures, all of which were found to be within normal range. The patient's findings were consistent with traumatic spinal spondyloptosis with additional findings concerning for physical child abuse. The initial history provided to the medical team included a confusing timeline and described a progressive decline in motor function. That along with a physical examination notable for head lag made this diagnosis initially challenging. Alternative diagnoses of systemic neurodegenerative disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy or other diseases of motor function such as botulism were considered. However, after the imaging, the diagnosis became clear, and concerns for NAT were raised. After confirmation of her diagnosis with imaging, the hospital's child protection team and the state of North Carolina's child protective services were notified. The patient underwent posterior spinal fusion from T11 to L1 to stabilize her spine. She also received intensive rehabilitation after surgery. Unfortunately, she did not regain lower extremity function and remains paraplegic. Her adoptive mother later admitted to shaking the child aggressively by holding her at the level of mid abdomen/lower thoracic back (the area of injury) and throwing her on the floor several weeks prior to presentation.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

{"clinical_note": "A 38-year-old woman was referred to Kennedy Krieger Institute a year after being officially diagnosed with TSC at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in October 2012. Before her diagnosis, the patient had several TSC-related manifestations that should have solidified diagnosis much earlier in her life. She had TSC-associated skin lesions, such as forehead plaques that were apparent as an infant and facial angiofibromas that developed later in her childhood. In her teenage years, she developed periungual fibromas on her foot that would only be removed by a podiatrist in 2003 when she was an adult.\nIn October 2009, at age 34, the patient had been put on hemodialysis; however, incomplete records received by our institute did not identify the indication for this. At least 1 large (3.8-cm) renal angiomyolipoma in the left kidney and multiple bilateral cysts were identified in 2011. These disease manifestations led the patient to undergo a bilateral nephrectomy later that year at age 36, and renal transplantation was considered as an option in the following year. She had also developed cardiac issues such as hypokinesis and low ejection fraction (40%), likely the result of renal complications. In addition to renal and cardiac issues, lung deterioration was observed as early as 2011. In October 2011, the patient presented with interstitial and alveolar infiltrates with bilateral pleural effusion. Diffuse lung cysts were observed in September 2012.\nIn October 2012, she was evaluated and diagnosed with TSC at the NIH. Her diagnosis was based on multiple manifestations of TSC identified during her evaluation. Numerous types of TSC-associated skin lesions were identified, including facial angiofibromas, cephalic plaques, oral fibromas, shagreen patches, ungual fibromas, and confetti skin lesions. Dental pitting was also observed. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed evidence of bilateral abnormal gray/white matter and bilateral subependymal nodules. Two retinal hamartomas were found in her left eye.\nThe patient\u2019s lung function subsequently declined, and in 2013, while being treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital, she was indicated for lung transplantation. However, there was a decision to wait for further decline because of the possibility of recurrence. She was also switched from hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis to lessen fatigue.\nThe patient\u2019s first visit to our clinic occurred in September 2013, at which point she underwent an initial evaluation for comprehensive management of TSC. After examination and reviewing her past medical history, we found that there were no concerns regarding epilepsy or neurodevelopmental delay. Upon lung examination, decreased breath sounds were noted, and it was recommended to start everolimus 5 mg daily to slow the progression of LAM and potentially improve lung function; however, she elected not to initiate treatment at that time. She was listed for renal transplantation pending results of pulmonary testing. A full dental consultation with follow-ups every 6 months was also recommended, in particular for sealant of dental pits.\nIn a subsequent visit in February 2014, abdominal imaging was recommended to monitor a previously-detected liver angiomyolipoma. After pulmonary tests, follow-up with other disciplines was recommended, including nephrology, neurology, pulmonology, ophthalmology, dentistry, dermatology, and cardiology. At this time, everolimus was recommended at 10 mg daily for treating pulmonary LAM, and the patient agreed to initiate treatment after this visit.\nAfter 1 day of taking everolimus 10 mg, the patient experienced dizziness and hypotension and self-discontinued treatment. Upon her visit in July 2014, it was decided to restart everolimus at 5 mg once daily, and midodrine was initiated for hypotension. The patient did not experience dizziness at the 5-mg dose.\nThe patient\u2019s next visit at our clinic would not be until March 2015. However, before this visit, she was scheduled for renal transplantation surgery that was stopped because of difficulties with anesthesia. As a result of depressed mood after her canceled renal transplantation, she self-discontinued everolimus again. As a result, pulmonary nodules and cysts throughout the lungs were observed with computed tomography, accompanied with worsening pulmonary function, and were likely attributable to the interruption of everolimus. We recommended she restart everolimus 5 mg once daily, and at her next visit focus on counseling and medication for depressed mood. As of July 2015, her mood has improved, and she is continuing everolimus 5 mg, with amenorrhea reported as the only noticed side effect.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 58-year-old woman with a four-year history of hypertension-diabetes comorbidity presented to the outpatient department of the Nyakach County Hospital with edematous swelling of the face and upper and lower lips of 11-hour duration (Figure ).\nThere was associated dysphagia with stridor and hoarseness of voice. She did not have any pruritus, urticaria, or rashes. The tongue was swollen and was reported as hard in consistency. It was wedged between her teeth which prevented her from closing her mouth. Saliva was pooling and dribbling from her mouth. The patient had no history of smoking, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough, atopy, or any recent use of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Additionally, there was no prior history of a similar episode. The outpatient card indicated that the patient had tolerated a twice daily peroral dose of metformin 500 mg, a once daily peroral dose of glibenclamide 5 mg, a once daily peroral dose of hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg, and a once daily per oral dose of enalapril 5 mg for four years. Other aspects of her medical history were unremarkable. On examination, she had a pulse rate of 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 140/72 mmHg. Pulse oximetry was not done. Her systemic examination was unremarkable. Review of her medication profile prompted us to suspect enalapril as the cause of the angioedema. Thus, we made use of the Naranjo probability scale to evaluate the likelihood that the observed effect was enalapril induced. Specific responses on this scale were one, two, one, zero, two, zero, zero, zero, zero, one for a cumulative score of seven, which ranks as probable. Therefore, a preliminary diagnosis of enalapril-induced angioedema was made and the enalapril was immediately discontinued. A 200 mg stat intravenous (IV) dose of hydrocortisone and a 20 mg stat dose of intravenous chlorpheniramine were administered and the patient was observed for one hour. The edema was noted to subside (Figure ) and a further three hour period of observation was allowed. The patient was then discharged on a once daily peroral dose of nifedipine 20 mg, a thrice daily peroral dose of chlorpheniramine 8 mg, and a tapered peroral dose of prednisolone as follows: 40 mg thrice daily for five days, 20 mg thrice daily for five days, 10 mg thrice daily for five days, and 5 mg thrice daily for five days. In addition, she was advised to continue with her usual doses of metformin, glibenclamide, and hydrochlorothiazide and to report to the hospital immediately if the swelling was to re-occur. On follow-up after one week, there was a marked change in facial appearance (Figure ), and at three weeks, the patient was symptom-free with a blood pressure (BP) of 142/78 mmHg (Figure ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions']"}

His home medications included aspirin, glimepiride, duloxetine, gabapentin, insulin glargine, prasugrel, furosemide, sotalol, rivaroxaban, and spironolactone. He also did not have a history of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.\nHe had a prior hospitalization for orthostatic hypotension and was eventually discharged to a skilled nursing facility but returned to the hospital three days later with an acute change in his mental status. On presentation, he was noted to have a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, a heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/73 mmHg, a temperature of 37\u00b0C, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The laboratory investigation revealed thrombocytopenia of 35 k/mcL as compared to 137 k/mcL three days earlier. Further workup was significant for an anion gap of 40 and LA of 18.7 mmol/L (reference range (ref) 0.5 - 2.0 mmol/L). He had also developed acute renal injury with creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL (ref 0.70 - 1.50 mg/dL). Liver enzymes were also elevated with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 254 U/L (ref 17 - 59 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 180 U/L (ref 21 - 72 U/L), and total bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dL (ref 0.2 - 1.2 mg/dL). Sepsis bundle was initiated with intravenous (IV) fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as microbial cultures, including the collection of two sets of blood cultures.\nAdditional investigation showed that lactate dehydrogenase was 1472 U/L (ref 110 - 216 U/L) but haptoglobin was normal: 85.9 mg/dL (ref 16 - 200 mg/dL). His hemoglobin was 6.4 g/dL (ref 14 - 17.4 g/dL), requiring blood transfusions while he also developed leukopenia; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was 670. Due to his change in mental status associated with thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal injury, there was a concern for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The peripheral blood smear demonstrated decreased platelets and an absence of schistocytes or blasts, but it did show numerous smudge cells and a few nucleated blood cells. ADAMTS-13 was 98 (ref >66 %) ruling out TTP. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis only revealed an enlarged liver and moderate splenomegaly but did not show any lymphadenopathy.\nAlthough his presentation was considered likely from sepsis, as his condition continued to deteriorate, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was also considered. He met four out of five criteria for HLH with a ferritin of 9374 ng/mL (ref 20 - 300 ng/mL) cytopenia, fever, and splenomegaly. However, his serum triglyceride was 244 mg/dL, which is lower than 265 mg/dL, the criteria needed for HLH. As the patient continued to deteriorate with worsening lactic acidosis (Figure ) despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, thiamine administration, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), a bone marrow biopsy was performed to evaluate for marrow erythrocytic phagocytosis. He was also started on the HLH treatment protocol, receiving dexamethasone. Cyclosporine was initiated the next day, followed by etoposide. He developed multiorgan failure with persistent encephalopathy, despite discontinuing all sedation, coagulopathy, worsening liver enzymes, and cytopenia. Serum LA remained elevated with a minimum value of 14.9 mmol/L during his seven-day hospital course (Figure ) and arterial blood pH varied from 7.15 to 7.25.\nA bone marrow biopsy showed that hemophagocytosis was not identified. The bone marrow contained a monomorphic cellular infiltrate with areas of necrosis and cellular degeneration. Less than 10% of the marrow appeared fully viable and contained a monomorphous infiltrate of cells with irregular nuclear contours and pale cytoplasm. The infiltrate was positive for CD45, CD20, and CD79a, and negative for CD34, with patchy non-specific staining for TdT. The Ki67 (MIB-1) proliferation rate was up to 60%. The absence of CD34 and a convincing TdT expression favored large B-cell lymphoma. The disease was classified as Ann Arbor stage IV due to its presence in the extra-lymphatic organs (liver and bone marrow). The age-adjusted international prognostic index (IPI) score was calculated to be 3, conferring high risk.\nChemotherapy regimen \u201cR-CHOP\u201d for this diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was planned with a few variations. As rituximab is dialyzed, it was not administered because he required CRRT and vincristine was held due to its hepatotoxicity on already deranged liver enzymes. Steroids were changed to IV methylprednisolone. Doxorubicin was also initiated followed by cyclophosphamide and etoposide while cyclosporine was discontinued. Unfortunately, his condition continued to deteriorate, and he became bradycardic and hypotensive, eventually requiring multiple vasopressors.

Her dry weight, documented one month after the start of CAPD by absence of both edema and hypertension, was 41.2 kg. Her height was 149 cm. She had not been seen by her CAPD providers for three months because of transportation difficulties when she was admitted with grand mal seizures followed by coma. One week prior to this admission, she communicated by telephone call with one provider. At that time, she reported total body swelling, moderate dyspnea and a body weight exceeding 70 kg. She was advised to use exclusively hypertonic dextrose (4.25%) CAPD dialysate and add two exchanges per day with short (1 hour) dwell times. Information obtained from relatives revealed that in the two days prior to this admission she had omitted her insulin dose because of anorexia and greatly decreased food intake.\nOn admission, she was comatose with a blood pressure of 180/74 mm Hg, regular pulse rhythm with a rate of 110 beats per minute, and temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius. Her weight was 63.6 kg. Remarkable findings on physical examination included anasarca detected even in her scalp, a ventricular gallop, and crackles in both lung fields. Chest X-ray confirmed the presence of pulmonary edema and electrocardiogram was unchanged from recent tracings, which were consistent with old transmural myocardial infarction. Laboratory tests on admission revealed extreme hyperglycemia, severe hypertonicity, hypokalemia and respiratory acidosis.\nOver the next 30 hours, she received insulin boluses and had frequent (every 2-4 hours) determinations of serum glucose and potassium concentrations. Serum glucose levels decreased progressively, while serum potassium levels remained between 3.1 and 3.4 mmol/L without administration of potassium salts. Blood pressure progressively decreased during treatment. At the end of treatment, she developed frank hypotension (blood pressure 80/60 mm Hg) and increased tachycardia to a pulse rate of 125 mm Hg, while remaining comatose. Chest X-ray revealed worsening pulmonary edema, while electrocardiogram was consistent with a new myocardial infarction and serum levels of cardiac enzymes (creatinine phosphokinase, troponin) were substantially elevated.

{"clinical_note": "A 41-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with a one-day history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (six loose bowel movements within the previous 24 hours). Five days prior to her presentation, she presented to an urgent care clinic with body aches, chills, and fever. She tested positive for influenza type A and was prescribed Tamiflu. Her husband and several other family members also tested positive for influenza. On admission to the emergency department, she denied chills, fever, abdominal pain, numbness, or paresthesias. Nausea and vomiting were exacerbated by oral intake of food and fluid. She also complained of generalized weakness in her upper and lower extremities bilaterally, as well as shooting pain down the lateral side of her right lower extremity. On physical exam, she was noted to have dry mucous membranes. The rest of her exam was unremarkable. Vital signs on admission were a temperature of 95.5\u00b0 F, pulse 94/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and blood pressure of 121/58 mmHg. She was started on 0.9% intravenous sodium chloride and Tamiflu. She was also started on ondansetron, prochlorperazine, and diphenhydramine for intractable nausea and vomiting. Her initial labs showed the following: white blood cell count (WBC) 13,200/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) 21.5 g/dL, hematocrit 67.3%, platelet count 361,000/mm3, sodium 135 mEq/L, potassium 5.8 mEq/L, chloride 96 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 16 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, glucose 169 mg/dL, calcium 8.4 mg/dL, and lactic acid 7.5 mg/dL.\nAfter IV fluid administration, she stated she was starting to feel better, but this was short-lived. She continued to have generalized muscle pain, weakness, and feelings of heaviness in her lower extremities. At this time, there was no evidence of edema. Repeat labs showed continued elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels; therefore, phlebotomy was recommended. Hours later, the patient became lethargic and experienced numbness and tingling in her hands and feet. On generalized exam, her extremities appeared purple and cyanotic. She denied pain but once again described pressure in her lower extremities. Her pulses were unable to be obtained by Doppler ultrasound. She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where an arterial blood gas (ABG) depicted a pH of 7.148, pO2 146 mmHg, pCO2 25 mmHg, and a base excess of -18. Her albumin level was 2.4 g/dL, and she was started on replacement therapy. Her creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels and liver function test were within normal limits. Neurology was consulted after episodes of sensory deficits to rule out Guillain-Barre syndrome.\nOn physical exam, she continued to have generalized weakness but presented with hyperreflexia of her deep tendon reflexes. It was recommended that a lumbar puncture be used to evaluate albuminocytologic dissociation and to possibly administer intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). After discussion, it was agreed that Guillain-Barre syndrome was unlikely and that further workup was not necessary. Labs showed no evidence of methemoglobinemia or carboxyhemoglobinemia. Heparin, insulin sliding scale, prochlorperazine, sodium bicarbonate, and IV fluids were administered. Her blood pressure began deteriorating rapidly, so Neo-Synephrine\u00ae was administered and the required doses of Neo-Synephrine escalated quickly. Repeat labs showed a continued elevation of the hemoglobin and hematocrit. Her WBC count increased significantly to 42,000/mm3. Labs confirmed that metabolic acidosis due to lactic acid continued to be present. She required intubation due to respiratory failure induced by her metabolic acidosis. She was coherent before intubation, and she only complained of generalized weakness and pressure on her lower extremities. Peripheral access was needed to run more lab work but was impossible due to the collapsibility of her veins. A central line was planned. However, the patient went into asystole and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was attempted to resuscitate the patient to no avail.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}

Examination revealed thick, yellow keratinaceous crusting on the upper and lower lips, sparing the mucosal lip and vermilion border, with associated edema, erosion, and tenderness to palpation (Figure ). Notably, minimal contact with the keratinaceous material and crusted plaque on physical examination resulted in complete sloughing and revealed a moist base and a nearly normal lip underneath.\nConsequently, the histopathological evaluation of a 4 mm punch biopsy from the debrided left lower lip was nonspecific, showing only features of chronic lymphocytic mucositis with spongiosis. Staining for fungal organisms using the Grocott's methenamine silver and periodic acid\u2013Schiff methods was negative, and Treponemal/Fite stains were negative for bacterial organisms. In-situ hybridization for human papillomavirus testing (subtypes 6/11, 16/18, 31/33) was also negative. A wound culture from the lower lip was positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.\nWhile the biopsy findings were not specific, the histopathologic pattern of spongiotic mucositis, in conjunction with the clinical features, suggested an exuberant irritant contact dermatitis\u2014in this case, further investigation revealed repeated self-injurious behaviors to the lips, supporting a diagnosis of factitial cheilitis. The patient was treated for secondary impetiginization with anti-staphylococcal antibiotics and topical antibiotic ointment for two weeks, counseled on avoidance of licking her lips, and referred back to her behavioral health specialist for management of her unspecified anxiety disorder. Notably, she had previously been treated for anxiety, but was lost to follow-up prior to presentation at our clinic. However, she noted that recent life stressors had caused exacerbation of her anxiety symptoms, which preceded the onset of her lip findings. The patient reported complete resolution of her lip symptoms within one month of psychiatric treatment and cessation of lip licking.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}

According to the patient\u2019s attendant, he was in his usual state of health two days prior when he developed a high-grade fever associated with a sore throat. Furthermore, patient\u2019s attendant mentioned that he was found in an altered state of consciousness along with fecal and urinary incontinence. The patient had no history of trauma to the head as well as no positive history of seizures. There was no significant past medical or surgical history. The patient\u2019s addiction history was positive for heroin, Hashish, and methamphetamine both orally as well as intravenously. On examination, his vital signs on arrival were as follows: blood pressure, 110/60 mmHg (reference, 120/80 mmHg); pulse, 100 bpm (reference, 70 to 100 bpm); respiratory rate, 30 breaths/minute (reference range, 18 to 22); and temperature, 102\u00b0F (reference, 98.6\u00b0F). Furthermore, in his general physical exam, he was positive for jaundice and had marks of cuts on his forearm, suggesting the possibility of multiple needle insertions. His abdominal, respiratory, and cardiovascular exam results were unremarkable. His Glasgow coma scale (GCS) on arrival was 10/15. He had dilated pupils reactive to light, as well as a positive corneal reflex. All cranial nerves were intact; however, signs of meningeal irritation were present. A motor examination showed an increased tone in all limbs, positive rigidity in all four limbs, his patellar reflex was 3+, his plantars were down-going, and clonus (ankle and knee) was negative. Furthermore, the results of the fundoscopic examination were unremarkable.\nWe immediately did clinical laboratory testing of this patient. His laboratory test results are presented in Table . Given our region, we also tested for malaria and found the patient was positive for Plasmodium falciparum. Given the patient\u2019s intravenous drug abuse, we also tested his viral markers and HIV status, the results of which were positive for both hepatitis B and C and HIV, with a CD4 count of 270 (reference range, 500 to 1500). Immediately, the patient was catheterized with monitoring of urine output, and a nasogastric tube was passed. The patient was started on artemether, 120 mg, delivered in six doses spaced 12 hours apart, and intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g/day for five days. The patient had low random blood glucose levels of 60 mg/dL (reference range, 79 to 160 mg/dL), for which he was started on 5% dextrose saline intravenously as well. At this point, we were suspicious of many differentials such as cerebral malaria, bacterial/tuberculous/fungal meningitis, cytomegalovirus/herpes simplex virus encephalitis, drug overdose, central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, as well as toxoplasmosis. To arrive at a final diagnosis, we conducted a series of additional investigations. We ordered a chest X-ray and ultrasound of the abdomen, the findings of which were unremarkable. To rule out meningitis, we did a lumbar puncture, and his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings are presented in Table . At the time of the lumbar puncture, his random blood glucose level was 102 mg/dL (reference range, 79 to 160 mg/dL). Results of the tests were negative for Cryptococcus antigen and tuberculosis. A computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain were unremarkable, thereby ruling out ring-enhancing lesions due to tuberculoma, CNS lymphoma or toxoplasmosis. To rule out infective endocarditis, we tested blood cultures and conducted an echocardiographic exam, the results of which were both unremarkable. We also ordered a urine toxicology test given the patient\u2019s status as a drug addict. The urine toxicology results were negative for any drug intoxication. By this point in our investigation, we became firm in our belief that cerebral malaria was the correct diagnosis.\nHowever, after 10 days of treatment, the patient showed considerable improvement despite being very critical in condition. He was no longer in an altered level of consciousness, and his fever had subsided. Furthermore, his GCS improved to 15/15, and his neurological examination results were normal. His laboratory findings had also improved.

He had undergone a Billroth II procedure over 20 years ago for a distal gastric ulcer. Physical examination revealed a midline abdominal incision scar and mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Blood test results showed total bilirubin of 5 mg/dl and an unconjugated bilirubin of 3 mg/dl. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were two times higher than normal. Ultrasonography revealed multiple subcentimetric gallstones confined to the thin-walled gallbladder with dilated intrahepatic ducts, 12-mm calibrated choledocus, and other organs were normal. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a semi-obstructing gallstone 13-mm in diameter in the choledocus. Owing to his history of a Billroth II procedure, performing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for gallstone in the choledocus was not possible. Because of this reason, a surgical decision was taken. After a right subcostal incision, the gallbladder and the fatty tissues surrounding the choledocus were found to be oedematous. However, a cholecystectomy was performed without any complication, followed by choledocus exploration and stone extraction with a T-tube insertion. A latex, 12-foot T-tube was used in the operation. The horizontal branch of the T-tube was shortened, and the T-tube was incised to form a gutter, with a V-notch added at the junction of the two arms. The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 5 with the T-tube spigotted and left in situ.\nThe patient's bilirubin levels done twice in six weeks were normal, and he had a problem-free recovery.

An increase in the C-reactive protein (CRP) level and white blood cell count were observed in the blood test results. An abdominal ultrasonography showed the presence of perihepatic fluid. Fine needle aspiration revealed that the perihepatic fluid was bilious. An 8F drainage catheter was introduced into the fluid, and a 14F drainage catheter was inserted into the choledocus. Cholangiography detected a bile leak from the choledocus. The tract of the leak was embolized with eight coils during angiography (Video ). After filling the tract with multiple coils and percutaneous drainage of the perihepatic fluid, the patient\u2019s symptoms subsided, and his test results were found to be normal.

Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens revealed hyperplastic polyps or tubular adenomas with low-grade atypia (Fig. ). She was not judged to be an appropriate case for complete endoscopic polypectomy because of multiple polypoid lesions. She underwent gastroscopy, where slight atrophic gastritis with erythematous edema was confirmed. She was not diagnosed with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection by rapid urease tests and histopathological findings.\n6 months later, the patient returned to clinic with a worse complaint of repeated mucous defecation (5\u20136 times/day) and bilateral leg edema.

Therefore, we performed laparoscopic low anterior resection of the rectum and the sigmoid colon with diverting ileostomy. During operation, we found thick subserosal layer with moderate fibrosis and edematous change. Anal surgical margin was located 3 cm above the dentate line. Surgical specimen revealed more than 100 polyps consisting of elongated and mild adenomatous glands with a thick layer of subserosal tissue (Fig. ). Polyps were covered with a layer of inflammatory granulation tissues and fibrinopurulent exudate. The intervening mucosa of the polyps was relatively normal, so the patient was diagnosed with cap polyposis (Fig. ).

{"clinical_note": "A 73-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Neurology due to tremors of the head, neck, and upper limbs, and moderate tremor of lower limbs. Initial symptoms appeared 20 years prior, primarily as a kinetic tremor of the left upper and lower limbs. During a neurological examination, the patient additionally presented dysarthria, paresis of the right facial nerve, brisk reflexes on the right side, bilateral dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, truncal ataxia, ataxia of lower limbs which was more prominent on the left side, and unstable gait. Psychological examination exposed mild cognitive impairment and deficits of executive functions. An MRI in 2016 revealed bilateral hyperintensity in the MCP and white matter of cerebellar hemispheres (Figure ).\nThe combination of intention tremor, ataxia, the MCP sign, and gait instability of patient's son and daughter instigated diagnosis of FXTAS. Use of the Amplide X FMR1 PCR kit (Asuragen) for extended molecular examination revealed permutations in the FMR1 gene (between 60 and 85 \u00b1 5 repeats of CGG), and confirmed the diagnosis of FXTAS with expansion of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene.\nDue to insufficient effects of pharmacological treatments (primidone and propranolol) to treat the tremors, radiosurgical thalamotomy using GK on the VIM of the left thalamus was performed. The Leksell Model G stereotactic coordinate frame (Elekta AB, Sweden) was attached to the patient's head. High-resolution MRI were acquired using a 1.5T scanner, and contrast-enhanced T1 and T2 images taken at 1 mm. The anterior commissure (AC), the posterior commissure (PC), and the third ventricle were identified (Figure ).\nStereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy was performed using the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion model (Elekta AB, Sweden). The target was localized to the VIM nucleus of the left thalamus. Final isocenter coordinates were selected by means of GammaPlan Software (Elekta AB, Sweden), and were set in the following manner: (x coordinate) 16 mm lateral to the AC-PC line which constituted 50% of the width of the III ventricle plus 11 mm; (y coordinate) 8 mm anterior to the PC; and (z coordinate) 3 mm superior to the AC-PC line.\nFinal optimization of the x coordinate was safely adjusted in order not to exceed the 18 Gy dose in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. A maximum dose of 130 Gy was delivered with a single, fully opened 4-mm collimator. Control examination was done 6 months after GK thalamotomy. Improvement was observed 4 months after the procedure.\nComparison of tremor intensity before and after the procedure was done using the FTRS and the Tremor Rating Scale (TRS) (Table ). The case presented in this study showed improvement in both rating scales (FTRS 54 \u2013 before and 44 \u2013 after, TRS \u2013 28 \u2013 before and 14,5 after). The improvement was observed in the right side corresponding to the lesion (Videos , ). This represents the most significant change in the context of the head tremor, postural tremor of the upper extremity and daily activities. Neurological examination showed that features such as dysarthria, central paresis of right facial nerve, bilateral dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, lower limb ataxia remained unchanged or insignificantly changed.\nPsychological examination did not present any relevant changes. Physiotherapist's examination revealed certain changes in the period before (2016) and after thalamotomy (2017). In the timed up and go (TUG) test before GK the patient did not present any abnormalities. After GK thalamotomy TUG showed dynamic imbalance. Examination also demonstrated static imbalance after GK thalamotomy, which was not observed before the procedure. Deterioration in certain features of the examination performed by the physiotherapist were associated with the progressive nature of FXTAS. This could also be observed during MRI, in the form of an increased signal in T2-weighted image within both hemispheres of cerebellum and bilaterally within middle cerebellar pedunculi, rather than side effects of GK thalamotomy ().

{"clinical_note": "An 11-year-old boy with Alagille syndrome received a related liver allograft during first year of life. Being EBV-negative at transplantation, seroconversion occurred 2 years later. Initial immunosuppression was based on tacrolimus, followed by a combination with mycophenolate mofetil. Ten years after transplantation, he suffered from severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and phono-/photophobia without B symptoms. Funduscopic examination revealed bilateral papilledema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain demonstrated multifocal lesions in the left hemisphere (Figure A). After initial treatment for suspected toxoplasmosis, biopsy of the lesion revealed a monomorphic EBV-associated PTLD with features of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma without MYC translocation (Figure B). Immunohistochemistry showed expression of CD20 and CD30. Most lymphoma cells expressed EBERs (Epstein\u2013Barr encoded RNAs), LMP1 (EBV latent membrane protein 1), and LMP2a while EBNA2 (Epstein\u2013Barr nuclear antigen 2) and BZLF1 (EBV immediate-early protein) were detected in a low number of neoplastic cells (Figure C). EBV PCR was negative in cerebrospinal fluid and weakly positive in peripheral blood (<1,000 copies/ml). Therefore, the diagnosis of EBV-related primary CNS PTLD was made.\nTotal body imaging and bone marrow aspirate histology displayed no evidence for systemic disease. During initial treatment with dexamethasone, symptoms rapidly improved. Immunosuppression was stopped and immune-/chemotherapy was initiated with six doses of intravenous (i.v.) rituximab (375 mg/m2) and weekly intrathecal (i.th.) therapy with rituximab (40 mg), methotrexate (12 mg), cytarabine (30 mg), and prednisone (10 mg) over 10 weeks (). A partial response by MRI was observed after 3 weeks evolving to complete remission at the end of immuno-/chemotherapy.

She took prescription colchicine at a dose of 15 mg (30 tablets 0.5 mg each), which is equivalent to 0.2 mg/kg. As her condition did not improve, she was brought to the emergency department. She had a past medical history of fibromyalgia, in addition to intestinal Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. Prior to admission, she was taking Neurotropin\u00ae (non-protein extract isolated from the inflamed skin of rabbits inoculated with vaccinia virus), pregabalin, butylscopolamine bromide, Lactomin (lactic acid bacteria \u2013 Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum), and colchicine. She neither smoked tobacco nor drank alcohol. Her social and environmental history was unremarkable. She had never worked. Her mother had schizophrenia.\nHer vital signs on arrival included blood pressure (BP) of 128/90 mmHg, pulse of 102 beats per minute, regular respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% room air, and body temperature of 37.5 \u00b0C; she was alert and conscious. She had upper abdominal tenderness with no rebound tenderness. The results of her cardiac, pulmonary, and neurological examinations were unremarkable. Complete blood count, renal function tests, urine analysis, and bacteria tests were normal except for mild hepatic dysfunction and elevated d-dimer levels (Table ). Although colchicine was administered below the lethal dose, she was admitted for observation.\nOn the day after the hospital admission, she developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thus, tracheal intubation using an artificial ventilator was performed. She also became dehydrated, due to diarrhea, which developed after admission. Peripheral circulatory insufficiency gradually worsened, and large amounts of infusion loads (including blood transfusions) were unable to maintain her BP. Her lactic acid level reached a maximum of 19 mmol/L. At maximum disease severity, she required noradrenaline 1 \u03bcg/kg/minute, vasopressin 2 units/hour, steroids 200 mg/day, dopamine 10 \u03bcg/kg/minute, dobutamine 4 \u03bcg/kg/minute, and adrenaline 0.15 \u03bcg/kg/minute to maintain BP. She also showed other organ failures, including worsening hepatic dysfunction after admission with maximum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 16,520 U/L as well as kidney dysfunction with associated anuria. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated for anuria and metabolic acidosis. At 36 hours post-admission, her lactic acid level reached its peak, and her hemodynamic reached a level at which she could tolerate water removal. At 72 hours post-admission, she was administered with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor due to the appearance of myelosuppression. In addition to the broad-spectrum antimicrobial administration, she was commenced on a course of antimycotic medication. Table shows the laboratory results of organs function over time.\nApproximately 1 week after admission, her BP could be maintained without the use of vasopressor drugs; however, as she showed poor alert wakefulness, a head computed tomography was performed. The results showed multiple intracranial hemorrhages of up to 12 mm in diameter (Fig. ), thought to be associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). As the disease course progressed, the hematomas were absorbed and our patient was able to respond to verbal commands. Approximately 2 weeks post-admission, she presented with marked hair loss.\nSubsequently, her general condition improved and, at discharge, all organ insufficiency had improved. The progress of her Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and D-dimer levels are shown in Fig. . She worked hard at rehabilitation.

{"clinical_note": "A 41-year-old woman, 21-week pregnant, presented to the Emergency Department with left-flank pain, hypotension (100/60 mmHg) and tachycardia (95 bpm). Blood tests were: haemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, leukocytosis 23.4 cell \u00d7 109/L, lactate 3.6 mmol/L, base excess \u22128.4 mol/L and serum creatinine 82 mmol/L. Abdominal ultrasound was normal but foetal monitoring demonstrated a drop in heart rate suggestive for impending demise. Placental abruption was suspected and following resuscitation she was brought to theatre. We found a large left-sided retroperitoneal haematoma and a non-viable foetus. Exploration also revealed a ruptured left RAA and a contralateral RAA. At this point, it was felt a percutaneous approach would have been more appropriate. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a massive retroperitoneal haematoma, a ruptured left RAA (Fig. ), and an intact right-sided RAA measuring 2.2 cm (Fig. ). Under selective angiography, the aneurysm was embolized and the bleeding controlled []. Recovery was rapid but a DMSA scan performed 2 weeks later, demonstrated reduced function in the treated kidney (37%). The risk of rupture of the right RAA was deemed significant and a plan for repair was made. The lesion was saccular, wide-necked and located at the artery bifurcation thus preventing endovascular treatment. We opted for hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy, ex-vivo repair and autotransplant.\nThe patient was placed in left lateral decubitus. An 8-cm-long suprapubic incision extended to the right iliac fossa was performed and the retroperitoneum was entered. A hand-port (GelPort\u00ae Laparoscopic System, Applied Medical, USA) and three 12-mm ports, one for the 30\u00b0 camera and the others for the instruments were inserted. Ureter, renal artery and renal vein were divided. The kidney was extracted through the incision, flushed and immerged into a cold solution (Soltran, Baxter Healthcare, USA). The aneurysm was resected and the remaining two arteries were prepared for implantation (Fig ). The patient was placed supine and the hand-port access was used for the autotransplant. The renal vein was anastomosed to the external iliac vein whereas the renal arteries were anastomosed to the external iliac artery. The ureteral-vesical anastomosis was performed according to Lich-Gregoire. The procedure took 481 min. Extraction, cold ischaemia and anastomosis times were 2, 48 and 52 min, respectively. Intra-operative blood loss was 280 mL. The postoperative course was uneventful. Histology showed myxoid medial degeneration of the renal artery.

{"clinical_note": "A 57-year-old African American male with past medical history of coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, alcohol abuse, and stage-IV sarcoidosis on long-term oral prednisone at 10 mg daily for over two years presented with massive hematemesis and melena that started the night before his arrival to the Emergency Department. Upon physical examination, the patient appeared pale and was noted to have tachycardia, hypotension, and hematochezia. He denied any recent alcohol intake, chest pain, abdominal pain, and abdominal or rectal trauma. Vital signs consisted of a blood pressure of 84/33 mmHg, heart rate of 118 bpm, room air saturation of 92%, and temperature of 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit (37.1 degrees Celsius). He was admitted to the medical ICU for hypovolemic shock secondary to massive bleeding that required immediate endotracheal intubation for airway protection. An initial blood work showed a hemoglobin count of 13.9 g/dL, white blood cell count of 18.7 K/UL, platelet count of 159 K/UL, sodium of 140 mmol/L, potassium of 3.8 mmol/L, chloride of 101 mmol/L, bicarbonate below 10 mmol/L, calcium of 2.2 mmol/L, albumin of 2.7 g/dL, CRP of 233 mg/L, ESR of 36 mm/hr, BUN of 17 mg/dL (6.07 mmol/L), creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL (132.6 Umol/L), lactic acid of 17.0 mmol/L, BNP of 1140.63 pg/ml, total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL, troponins of 0.020 ng/mL, and CK-MB of 408 ng/mL. Resuscitation was initiated with administration of isotonic solutions, blood transfusions, and initiation of vasoactive medications, and pantoprazole drip was provided. An initial urgent endoscopy revealed a bleeding Dieulafoy lesion, which was immediately clipped. Acute kidney injury was addressed with aggressive fluid resuscitation as evident by increase in BUN of 33 mg/dL (11.78 mmol/L) and creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL (256.33 Umol/L). CT scan of abdomen performed to rule out ischemic colitis in the setting of progressive abdominal distention showed a diffuse pericolonic inflammation most pronounced at the rectosigmoid colon. Repeat endoscopy showed multiple ulcerated lesions of the gastric mucosa () with a biopsy that revealed necrotic debris with acute leukocytic exudate and numerous variably sized, 90-degree angulated fungal hyphae favoring mucormycosis (). Intravenous liposomal amphotericin-B (5 mg/kg/day at 60 kg weight) was started at a dose of 300 mg daily. Due to deterioration of renal function on the second day, treatment was switched to oral suspension of posaconazole at a dose of 400 mg twice a day for a total of 6 days (of note, no levels of posaconazole were drawn during hospital course). Repeat CT scan of the abdomen showed mild-to-moderate hydroureter with hydronephrosis and bladder wall thickening Figures and . Cystoscopy showed distorted anatomy of bladder lumen with multiple mounds of tissues all throughout the bladder most notable in the trigone with failure to locate ureteral orifices. Random biopsies taken from the bladder tissue also showed necrotic debris with active inflammatory and numerous variably sized angulated fungal hyphae consistent with Mucorales species. Once bladder biopsy confirmed Mucor spp, treatment was switched from posaconazole to intravenous isavuconazonium sulfate at a dose of 372 mg every eight hours for 48 hours as loading dose and then to an oral dose of 372 mg daily. Unfortunately, no sensitivity of the isolate to the newer triazoles was available. Surgical approach was considered; however, given patient's frail state and multiple comorbidities, such approach was deferred. Hydronephrosis significantly improved after placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes. In addition, continuous bladder irrigation with amphotericin-B was given for localized bladder infection for a total of 5 days. A three-way Foley catheter was inserted for continuous amphotericin-B bladder irrigation where 200 ml of medication was administered via catheter; then, the catheter was clamped for 90 minutes and drained to gravity every six hours. After three weeks of systemic treatment with antifungals, a third endoscopy showed only inflammatory changes with a pathologic report, in which mucormycosis was no longer appreciated. His kidney function improved and remained stable after clamping and removal of his nephrostomy tubes. The patient completed 6 months of therapy with 372 mg of oral isavuconazonium sulfate per day.

Radiograph of the hip was negative for dislocation or fracture. On physical exam, she had proximal muscle weakness greater in the lower extremities, and the rest of her examination was negative for skin rashes, lymphadenopathy, joints inflammation, and pedal edema. Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no ST-T changes. Blood work showed elevated CPK (9767), CKMB (101.50), and aldolase (60) levels and LFT derangement (AST-302 and ALT404) (Tables and ). Other lab findings were negative for ANA, anti-Jo antibody, and antimitochondrial antibody. Thyroid function tests were normal. At that time the patient was taking atorvastatin 80 mg which recently replaced simvastatin for better hyperlipidemia control. Atorvastatin was discontinued, and the patient was followed closely in the medical clinic. The proximal muscle weakness continued to progress rapidly during the following month with significant impairment of her walking and rising from a chair without support. The physical exam revealed a decrease to 2 out of 5 motor strength of the proximal upper extremities and 3 out 5 of the proximal lower extremities, and the rest of the physical examination remained normal. Laboratory results with persisting elevated muscle enzyme (CPK, CKMB, and aldolase) levels remained elevated. Testing for anti-HMGCR antibody with ELISA was positive at 34 (reference value: greater than 20 is positive). Muscle biopsy was consistent with necrotizing myopathy (Figures and ). Taken with the antibody results, the final diagnosis of statin-induced necrotising autoimmune myopathy was performed. Findings were consistent with diagnosis of necrotizing autoimmune myositis. Prednisone therapy started at 1 mg/kg per day and tapered over the next three months. The patient's proximal upper and lower strength and mobility improved back to her baseline with normalization of the muscle enzymes and the liver function tests. Upon further review of the patient's chart it was found that she had been taking simvastatin for at least thirteen years which was recently discontinued after which she was switched to atorvastatin. Due to necrotizing myopathy's high association with malignancy, cancer screening reports were reviewed. The patient had a normal colonoscopy in 2014, cervical cancer screening was negative, and calcifications on serial mammograms remained stable.

She reports no past medical history, and social history is notable for tobacco use. The patient stated that she first noticed a small, yellow, and fleshy bump on her right nipple approximately two years prior. She became concerned due to its rapid growth in the last year. Four months prior, she visited her primary care provider who performed a shave biopsy of the lesion. Initial pathology results suggested squamous cell carcinoma, but this was thought to be discordant with the clinical picture. At consultation, she reported that her right breast had also started feeling hot and tender for two weeks duration. On examination, her right breast was erythematous and rigid with a 2.2 cm lesion consuming the right nipple. Her nipple also drained yellow pus. The patient was placed on a course of antibiotics due to concerns for an abscess.\nAn MRI was ordered to investigate possible underlying breast malignancy. Results of the MRI showed no solid mass underlying the nipple. A wedge biopsy of the nipple was performed to confirm the initial shave biopsy pathology (). Pathology showed verrucous histologic features with chronic inflammation and underlying abscess with concerns for a possible cutaneous malignancy. Specifically, there was marked papillomatosis with hypergranulomatosis between the papillae as well as a lack of granules at the papillary surfaces. Immunohistochemical testing was also positive for HPV L1 capsid protein. Because the initial shave biopsy showed SCC with positive margins, this clinical picture suggested that an inadequate sample was taken during the wedge biopsy. After consultation of literature, excision with wide margins was determined to be appropriate for removal of the lesion.\nThe patient underwent a wide excision of the right nipple-areola complex for removal of the growth. A 6.2 cm x 3.2 cm skin ellipse was excised encompassing the 2.2 cm nipple lesion. On final histologic examination, the lesion was found to be a large tumor with verrucous features, hyperkeratosis, dyskeratosis, and nests of keratin pearl formation (). Two areas showed microinvasion of the dermis with loss of the basal lamina. There were also significant acute and chronic inflammatory responses in the deep dermis representing an underlying abscess. These findings are congruent with the diagnosis of a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with arising within verruca vulgaris. All margins were found to be clear of tumor cells.

He denied any history of palpitations, hand tremors, abdominal pain, diarrhea, body weight loss, and numbness of limbs. Neither he nor his family members had previously experienced any such attack.\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 121/63 mmHg, body temperature was 36.6 \u00b0C, pulse rate was 102 beats per minute, and respiration rate was 18 breaths per minute. The patient had decreased muscle power especially in the lower extremities (lower limbs: proximal muscles 2/5 and distal muscles 4/5; upper limbs: proximal muscles 4/5 and distal muscles 5/5), but there was no flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities or areflexia. Other physical examination findings were unremarkable. The results of biochemical studies conducted on admission are shown in Table . Marked hypokalemia (2.2 mmol/L) and mild hypomagnesemia (1.8 mg/dL) were prominent findings. Urine potassium excretion indicated renal potassium wasting [transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG): 7.02; and fractional excretion of potassium (FeK): 7.12]. Potassium supplementation was initiated with potassium chloride (KCl) infusion (20 mEq of KCl in 500 mL of normal saline infused at a rate of 120 mL/h). The serum potassium level was corrected (from 2.2 to 3.8 mmol/L) within 4 h via KCl replacement (total: 19.2 mEq).

Because TPP was highly suspected due to the rapid resolution of hypokalemia despite high renal potassium excretion, an oral beta-blocker and anti-thyroid medication (propranolol, 10 mg BID, and methimazole, 5 mg BID) were prescribed for controlling the hyperthyroidism. Normal anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (< 1.0 IU/mL) and high titers of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody (18.4%) indicated Graves\u2019 disease. Thyroid sonogram revealed bilateral multinodular goiter (Fig. ). Finally, he was discharged on day 3 of admission in a stable condition with normal serum potassium levels.\nNo hypokalemia was noted during the outpatient follow-up (at 9 days after discharge).

{"clinical_note": "A 30-year-old male patient presented for a consultation in the Prosthodontics department of the Lyon University Hospital (France). The patient complained of a pain caused by the mobility of his maxillary right central incisor (11) (Fig. ). Patient history revealed a trauma with luxation and periradicular infection of the tooth, as well as daily use of tobacco and cannabis. Clinical examination of the oral cavity indicated poor hygiene, dental discolorations, moderate periodontal disease, and edentulous zones due to upper first premolar extractions. The painful tooth was horizontally and vertically mobile (more than 2 mm), partially extruded with vestibular position and gingival inflammation, without local signs of active infection. The dental radiograph of the incisor revealed periradicular bone loss (Fig. ).\nAn early treatment was proposed to the patient to manage the loose incisor. It involved the extraction of the traumatized incisor due to its very poor prognosis, and then the immediate replacement of the lacking tooth with an artificial one. Several options were proposed to the patient, including the placement of a dental implant with a provisional crown, of a cantilever bridge, or of a removable partial denture. All options were discussed, and after a one week period of reflection the patient finally selected the realization of a temporary removable denture for economic reasons. The patient was informed that final prosthetic rehabilitation will be initiated only after treatment of the periodontal disease and disappearance of tissue inflammation. Clinical and technical steps were summarized in a timeline (Additional file ).\nTo avoid the risk of extraction of the loose incisor that could occur when taking an impression with alginate, we decided to make a digital impression of the patient\u2019s maxillary and mandibular dental arches with an intraoral scanner (TRIOS 2; 3Shape Copenhagen, Danemark) (Fig. and ). Vestibular areas were scanned using lip and cheek retractors (Optragate, Ivoclar, France). Arches were then virtually aligned using two vestibular records, as recommended by the manufacturer. Color registration was performed with the Vivodent PE shade guide (Ivoclar, France) (Fig. ). Arch digital impressions were converted into STL files and imported in dental CAD software (DentalCad, Exocad, Germany) (Fig. ). The traumatized incisor was then removed virtually (Fig. , and ).\nA virtual central incisor was generated from the contralateral central incisor (21) by using the mirror tool (Fig. ) and saved in an independent file. The latter was then imported into a second CAD software (Freeform, 3D Systems, US) and two small cylindrical volumes were created into the palatal side of the virtual incisor to create a retention area (Fig. and ). In the same software, limits of the denture base were virtually designed by using the point and click tool. The denture was generated with a volume (average thickness of 2.5 mm) corresponding to a replica of the patient palatal surface (Fig. and ). Data generated were then exported to a 5-axis milling machine (DWX 52 DC, Roland, Japan) and the resin artificial incisor was made by milling a stratified ivory disk of PolyMethylMethAcrylate (PMMA) (Trilux, Vipi, Italy). The denture base was produced from a disk of pink PMMA (Ivobase CAD, Ivoclar, France). The incisor was bonded onto the denture base using an adhesive agent (Probase, Ivoclar, France). Two metal clasps were manually designed and manufactured on a model printed in parallel (ProJet 3500 HD, 3D Systems, US) by using clap wires (Wironit, Bego, France). Clasps were integrated into the denture base with autopolymerisable resin (Probase, Ivoclar, France) (Fig. ). Upon reception to the clinics (three weeks after digital impressions), the removable denture was cleaned, and finishing and polishing were checked.\nAfter oral disinfection with 0,5% chlorhexidine (Eludril Pro, Pierre Fabre Oral Care, France), a local anesthesia was realized in the buccal and palatal oral mucosa next to the loose incisor. The latter was then extracted atraumatically and hemostasis was realized by compress application (Fig. ). After having controlled the formation of the initial clot, the immediate removable partial denture was positioned into the mouth (Fig. and ). No correction was needed. The initial retention of the denture base was excellent. The patient reported no difficulty with mastication and expressed his great satisfaction for aesthetical appearance of the prosthesis. Occlusal integration was checked to prevent any static or dynamic dysfunctional contacts. The form, volume and texture of the milled central incisor was adequate. The tooth color was fine, although translucency matching was difficult to obtain with a resin stratified ivory disk. He was recalled after one week to assess wound healing and the patient tolerance to the immediate prosthesis. Patient reported an excellent aesthetic and occlusal integration (Fig. ). Healing of the oral mucosa was confirmed by the closure of extraction socket and the non-inflammatory aspect of the oral mucosa (Fig. ).

During surgery, torsion was detected in her left adnexa; a left cystic mass with torsion was necrotic in appearance and was completely lacking normal ovarian and fallopian tube tissue. A left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. An oophoropexy was performed on her right ovary with absorbable suture at the level of the pelvic brim of the sidewall of her abdomen after draining peripheral cysts (Fig. ); an incidental appendectomy was performed. Pathologic examination of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of a necrotic ovary. She had cysts smaller than 1 cm on the existing single contralateral ovary they were aspirated during surgery.

{"clinical_note": "A 69-year-old lady with a background of penicillin allergy and left-sided breast cancer treated with mastectomy and axillary node clearance was admitted to the hospital in Liverpool in 2016 with a right-sided breast abscess. The patient had been aware of a lump in her right breast for 3 years and had been told it was a sebaceous cyst. However, it had become painful, and she was now feeling unwell and tachycardic but remained apyrexial.\nAntibiotic therapy was initiated with IV clindamycin 450 mg TDS and IV teicoplanin 12 mg/kg BD and then with 12 mg/kg OD after 2 days. The abscess was aspirated and subsequently incised and drained under local anaesthetic. The frank pus drained was malodorous, so oral metronidazole 500 mg TDS was added on. As there was no clinical improvement after 48 hours, a second incision and drainage was performed under general anaesthetic, revealing a large abscess cavity extending 10 cm into the right breast and 7 cm into the left mastectomy scar. This combined with continued triple antibiotic therapy resulted in clinical improvement, so after 4 days of IV therapy, antibiotics were stepped down to oral erythromycin 500 mg QDS of 7-day course and metronidazole 500 mg TDS of 10-day course and the patient was discharged. The abscess healed well in the community.\nTwenty-one days after sending aspirated pus for MC + S, Actinomyces europaeus was grown in the culture. The patient was still clinically well, the abscess was healing well, and no underlying chest source of infection was identified.\nThe breast abscess pus was sent to the microbiology laboratory for testing. There were Gram-positive cocci visualised on the direct Gram stain, but there was no evidence of any Gram-positive bacilli. The pus was cultured onto the following plates: blood agar, MacConkey agar, selective anaerobic agar with a 5-microgram disc, and a fastidious anaerobic agar (FAA) plate in accordance with the laboratory standard operating procedure (SOP) based on the UK Standards for Microbiology Investigations (SMI) []. After 4 days of growth, two colonies grew on the direct FAA plate, which were different. The first colony was identified, using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI-TOF) machine, as a Staphylococcus epidermidis. The MALDI-TOF equipment used was Bruker Microflex utilising MALDI Biotyper Version 3.1 software. The MS method of identification was the AutoX setting, and the software library was the BDAL and Filamentous Fungi Library Version 1.0. The second colony failed to be identified using MALDI. Therefore, the second organism was subbed onto an Actinomyces plate (blood agar with supplementary metronidazole and nalidoxic acid) in accordance with the local SOP. Four days later, there was fine growth on the Actinomyces plate. Sensitivities were obtained via the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) method of disc diffusion. The organism was sensitive to penicillin 42 mm (sensitivity > 23 mm), erythromycin 40 mm (sensitivity > 10 mm), vancomycin 30 mm (no breakpoint available), tetracycline 42 mm (no breakpoint available), and ciprofloxacin 22 mm (no breakpoint available). The organism was initially identified as Actinomyces europaeus, but the MALDI score was only 1.82; therefore, an extraction MALDI was performed to increase the MALDI score, so a more confident identification of the organism was obtained. The subsequent MALDI identity was Actinomyces europaeus with a score of 2.10. As per the guidance from the SMI, the organism was sloped and sent to the Anaerobic Reference Unit at Colindale. The ID was confirmed as Actinomyces europaeus by partial sequencing of 16sRNA.\nMicrobiological advice consisted of a long course of antibiotics to eradicate the infection, and the first-line treatment was 2 weeks of IV ceftriaxone followed by 6 months of oral amoxicillin. This was not feasible due to the patient's penicillin allergy.\nSecond-line advice was 2 weeks of IV erythromycin followed by 6 months of oral erythromycin. However, this was also not feasible. The outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) service enables patients to receive IV therapy in the community but was unable to provide the four times daily dosing required for IV erythromycin. The OPAT service was only able to provide twice daily regimens.\nThe third-line approach was acceptable: 2 weeks of IV tigecycline given in twice daily doses followed by 6 months of oral doxycycline. The patient had a midline inserted and received her IV therapy in the community with OPAT services.\nAfter completing the IV tigecycline course with no issues, the patient complained of side effects following 6 weeks of oral doxycycline therapy: oral thrush and leg blisters. Antibiotic therapy was switched to oral clarithromycin to complete a 6-month course of oral antibiotics.

{"clinical_note": "A healthy 15-year-old male presented with a three-week history of irretractable abdominal pain, vomiting, and anorexia. There was no previous similar history or abdominal surgery. He associated the onset of symptoms with a recent contraction of gastroenteritis within the family. There was no improvement in his condition despite his family contacts recovering.\nOn examination, he was afebrile and haemodynamically stable. There was a scaphoid abdomen with maximal tenderness in the right upper quadrant. There was significant guarding. Bowel sounds were audible. His abdominal X-ray and routine blood test results were both unremarkable, other than a raised C-reactive protein of 92.\nHis high opioid requirement, chronicity of symptoms, and examination findings prompted further evaluation with CT. This revealed right-sided abdominal mass and a layering effect at the caecal pole consistent with an intussusception. The appearance was similar to a \u201cpseudokidney,\u201d as shown in . There was marked free fluid within the abdominal cavity. After resuscitation, he proceeded to a laparotomy.\nA diagnostic laparotomy was performed for the inspection of abdominal contents. It confirmed radiological findings of an intussusception of the terminal ileum within the caecal pole. A hard mass was noted within the hepatic flexure region. There was a dilated terminal ileum and multiple lymph nodes noted within the mesentery.\nA right hemicolectomy was performed. Vascular pedicles were taken high for an appropriate oncological resection, given the suspicion. Primary ileocolic stapled side-to-side anastomosis was performed. The recovery was uncomplicated and the patient was discharged home three days postoperatively.\nAs shown in , the histopathology of the excised mass proved to be Burkitt's lymphoma of the terminal ileum causing ileocolic intussusception. It extensively involved the appendiceal serosa, mesentery, and omentum.\nThe tumour was an ulcerated lesion infiltrating all layers of the bowel wall. As shown in microscopically, the characteristic starry sky growth pattern was visualised, with the cells having round nuclei, finely clumped chromatin, and small basophilic nucleoli.\nA panel of immunostains was performed on bowel tumour, the regional lymph nodes, and the omentum. The tumour cells in all three sites are CD20, CD10, BCL6, and C-MYC positive (see ). The tumour has a very high proliferative index with almost 100% of the tumour expressing Ki67. BCL2, Cyclin D1, TdT, CD3, CD5, CD23, and CD30 are negative. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) detected a reciprocal t(8;14) translocation and rearrangement of the C-MYC gene. As only chromosome-specific probes were used, the presence of other abnormalities cannot be excluded. The above profile supports the original diagnosis of BL.\nThe medical literature in the PubMed and Medline/EMBASE databases was reviewed for cases of Burkitt's lymphoma-related intussusception. All publications were scrutinized that contained keywords of \u201cintussusception\u201d and \u201cBurkitt lymphoma.\u201d The literature search was limited to paediatric patients under 18 years old, and restricted to papers written in English.\nA systematic review of relevant literature was performed to ascertain variance of clinical features in primary presentations of BL-related intussusception.

{"clinical_note": "The 2-month-old African American infant was born at full term, at 2890 grams, following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery with an Apgar of seven and nine at one and five minutes, respectively. In the newborn nursery, her physical exam did not note any murmur, and her congenital cardiac screen was documented as normal (pre- and postductal saturations 100%) on day two of life. She had no family history of congenital heart defects, arrhythmias, or other cardiac diseases. The infant was discharged home with her mother on day of life two with follow-up arranged with the pediatrician.\nAt home, she remained stable with no respiratory distress, no feeding difficulties, and adequate weight gain. Her mother did note that the infant's hands and feet appeared slightly \u201cdark\u201d at home, but she was reassured that this was normal acrocyanosis. Her pediatrician saw her at two separate routine office visits, where no murmur or other abnormality was reported. Approximately three days prior to presentation, the infant developed cough, congestion, and rhinorrhea. She was due for her two-month well-child exam, so her mother took her to the clinic for an evaluation. At that time, the infant weighted 4.3 kg placing her at approximately the tenth percentile on a Center for Disease Control growth chart. The pediatrician was concerned by her visible acrocyanosis and pulse oximetry documented an oxygen saturation of 80% in room air, so she was immediately referred to an emergency department for further evaluation.\nOn arrival to the emergency department, she was hypoxic with oxygen saturations of 20\u201330% and hypothermic to 32\u00b0C. No murmurs were noted on physical exam. Peripheral access was established, first with a tibial intraosseous catheter and then with a peripheral intravenous line; she received a normal saline bolus, a blood culture was drawn (which remained negative), and a dose of ceftriaxone was administered. A rapid sequence intubation was performed with etomidate and vecuronium. The child was successfully intubated with no complications. Despite this and increasing oxygen administration up to 100% FiO2, her oxygen saturation peaked at 80%. Initial labs were significant for blood glucose 95 mg/dL, white blood cell count 7 \u00d7 109/L, hemoglobin 22 g/dL, hematocrit 68%, and lactate 5.5 mmol/L. Chest X-ray could not view the aortic knob or descending aorta well and could not rule out a right-sided aortic arch (). With these findings and the severity of her illness, the decision was made to transfer the patient to a tertiary pediatric medical center.\nOn arrival, a brief transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was concerning for Tetralogy of Fallot with critical pulmonic stenosis versus atresia. She received an additional normal saline bolus, sodium bicarbonate, midazolam, and fentanyl. On attempts to draw labs, her blood was noted to be very dark and hyperviscous, clotting almost immediately.\nThe infant was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for further stabilization and started on a prostaglandin drip with the hope of reopening her ductus arteriosus to increase pulmonary blood flow. Repeat TTE confirmed the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot with severe pulmonary stenosis, hypoplastic main and branch pulmonary arteries, right-sided aortic arch, and small secundum atrial septal defect (). At no point was a murmur heard by any provider from the ED, PICU, or Cardiology. Over the next several hours, she continued to decompensate with worsening hypoxia and hypotension despite phenylephrine infusion, fentanyl infusion, and aggressive fluid resuscitation. Pediatric cardiothoracic surgery evaluated the patient, and the decision was made to perform an emergent Blalock\u2013Taussig (BT) shunt.\nThe patient underwent modified BT shunt with a 3.5 mm Gore-Tex shunt anastomosing the innominate artery to the main pulmonary artery. There were no complications, and she returned to the PICU for post-op recovery. Daily TTE demonstrated normal biventricular function without pericardial effusion, as well as flow across BT shunt and through both branch pulmonary arteries. On post-op day one, she was extubated and weaned to room air, where she was able to maintain oxygen saturations around 88%. By post-op day two, she was tolerating oral feeds. She was discharged home on post-op day four with 40.5 mg of aspirin daily to help prevent shunt thrombosis. On discharge, her parents noted a vast difference in the infant's general appearance and energy level. The plan is to take the infant back to the operating room to perform a complete repair with a transannular patch at 4\u20136 months of life.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 75-year-old Chinese male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and osteoarthritis arrived to our Emergency Department (ED) due to unstable gait. The patient stated that he was a resident of Yonkers, New York (NY). His only travel history involved a train ride to Flushing, NY, the day prior to presentation. The patient reported frequent walks in local parks around Yonkers, NY. At the time of initial examination, he denied headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, back or chest pain, rashes, focal weakness, or loss of sensation. He had not noticed any ticks or tick bites on his skin in the past year. On physical exam, he was noted to have normal extraocular muscle movements, neurologic exam without focal deficits, and musculoskeletal, cardiac, and respiratory exams without abnormalities. His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 beats per minute. His labs revealed slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and thrombocytopenia along with increased bilirubin levels. His chest X-ray (CXR), rapid influenza swabs, blood cultures for bacteria, and urine analysis were negative. He was treated in the ED until he was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic, after which he was then discharged.\nHe returned 4 days later complaining of worsening fevers since discharge, with a maximum recorded temperature of 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.55\u00b0C), occasional rigors, chills, diaphoresis, diffuse myalgias, generalized weakness, malaise, confusion, and decreased appetite. The patient's gait was noted to be unstable with difficulty maintaining balance. On physical examination, the patient appeared lethargic. He was noted to be tachycardic at 98 beats per minute (bpm), to have a black discoloration of patient's tongue, and to have a recorded temperature of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit (39.33\u00b0C). His blood pressure, respiratory rate, and the remainder of his neurological exam was normal. His CXR was significant for fullness in the right mediastinum, cardiomegaly, and unfolded aorta. His hemoglobin, hematocrit, and comprehensive metabolic panel remained stable from previous admission. It was noted that the patient had decreased white blood cell (WBC) count and severe thrombocytopenia on readmission (). Initial serum ELISA for Lyme disease, used as a screening tool, was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed no plaque deposition, demyelination, or other acute pathologic processes. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a small aneurysmal dilatation of the thoracic aorta and splenomegaly with an acute appearing splenic infarct. He was started on ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and vancomycin to cover for a bacterial infection.\nDuring the second night of hospitalization, the patient's heart rate spiked to over 200 bpm and he became hypotensive. He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for management of severe hemodynamic instability and decompensated respiratory status. The patient's fever of unknown origin, encephalopathy, and negative initial screening tests prompted us to draw additional sets of serum tests for multiple possible bacterial, viral, and fungal etiologies. Unlike the initial serology, this new set yielded positive test results for the Lyme IgG and IgM ELISA test, Lyme IgM Western blot, and Babesia microti IgG and IgM antibody tests (). To confirm the diagnosis, a lumbar puncture (LP) was performed after patient's thrombocytopenia was corrected. During the LP procedure, the CSF was noted to be proteinaceous and congealed by the performing interventional radiologist. The LP resulted in positive tests for Lyme IgG and IgM antibody levels by Western blot, as well as a positive Western Blot for Lyme IgM (). Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, West Nile virus, and rheumatoid factor were not present. The patient was then started on doxycycline for the diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis. Within 48 hours of doxycycline administration, the patient clinically improved, his mentation returned to baseline, and his gait returned to normal. The patient was treated for 5 days and was discharged on an oral course of doxycycline for a total of 21 days.\nHere we have presented a patient who had no characteristic clinical signs of LD, whose main symptoms were a high fever, encephalopathy, diffuse myalgia, and tachycardia. Blood culture, urine culture, and CSF gram stain were negative. An MRI of the brain and CT of the chest/abdomen showed no source of infection.

{"clinical_note": "A 51-year-old male was referred to our hospital because of a three-month history of gradually progressing renal failure. During his first hospitalization, he complained of lumbar pain. On physical examination, he had conjunctival pallor and severe percussion tenderness of his back. No skin lesions or neurological deficits were seen. Laboratory test results were as follows: hemoglobin, 8.7 g/dL; creatinine, 7.01 mg/dL; total protein, 7.4 g/dL; albumin, 3.2 g/dL; calcium, 14.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 6.2 mg/dL; beta-2-microglobulin, 27.9 mg/L; IgG, 341 mg/dL; IgA, 21 mg/dL; IgM, 18 mg/dL; free kappa light chain, 99,900 mg/L; and free lambda light chain, 9.7 mg/L. Chest X-ray results were normal. Computed tomography (CT) showed vertebral compression fractures of Th8 and L1 and bilateral pleural effusions without calcified lesions. Urine immunoelectrophoresis showed a positive result for the Bence-Jones protein. Bone marrow aspiration revealed plasma cell proliferation (65% of total nucleated cells, ) with expression of CD38 and CD56, absence of CD19 and CD20, and an MIB-1 labeling index of 25%. Chromosomal analysis of the bone marrow by G-banding showed a normal 46,XY karyotype, but fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed the abnormalities del(13q) and t(4;14). He was diagnosed with Bence-Jones protein type MM (stage III according to the International Staging System, and stage IIIB according to the Durie\u2013Salmon classification system).\nWe began treatment with intravenous fluids and intramuscular injections of calcitonin to treat the severe hypercalcemia. Simultaneously, he received bortezomib-dexamethasone (Bd) therapy (subcutaneous injection of 1.3 mg/(m2\u00b7day) bortezomib plus 20 mg/day dexamethasone orally on days 1, 4, 8, and 11). Unexpectedly, he experienced severe acute heart failure on day 8, and temporarily required the support of a mechanical ventilator. Bd therapy was discontinued during the first treatment cycle. Because renal function had not improved, maintenance hemodialysis was initiated. Subsequently, we continued MM treatment with two cycles of vincristine-doxorubicin-dexamethasone (0.4 mg/body of vincristine and 9 mg/m2 of doxorubicin on days 1 to 4; and 40 mg/body of dexamethasone on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of a 28-day cycle) and the M2 protocol (multiple chemotherapeutic agents, not including proteasome inhibitors), followed by lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd) therapy (5 mg/day lenalidomide on days 1 to 21 plus 20 mg/body dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle).\nAbout four months after starting Rd therapy, the patient suffered from myoclonus-like movement of the lower extremities. During the sixth cycle of Rd therapy, he complained of pain in both lower legs, but did not have skin lesions or tenderness. He had been taking loxoprofen, fentanyl (patch and buccal tablet), mecobalamin, ferrous fumarate, lansoprazole, amlodipine, furosemide, alfacalcidol, and darbepoetin alfa. It was unlikely that his pain was drug-induced.\nThe patient's serum creatinine kinase level was elevated to 1,268 U/L. Diffusion-weighted and short tau inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse high signal intensity in the crural muscles (). A muscle biopsy was performed on the right tibial anterior muscles () and 40 mg/day prednisolone was prescribed by a neurologist because of suspected polymyositis/dermatomyositis. However, typical pathologic findings of polymyositis/dermatomyositis, like lymphocyte infiltration around muscle fibers, were absent and vessel calcification was noted. Prednisolone was ineffective against his symptoms. During steroid administration, well-demarcated ulcers developed on the right lower leg, both exterior thighs, and the penis. These ulcers gradually worsened () and the patient experienced severe pain, especially during dialysis or exercise. He could not continue dialysis because of this exacerbation of pain. Moreover, muscle atrophy of his lower limbs impaired his daily activities. The administration of 40 mg/day prednisolone was continued for 42 days and was then stopped on the 84th day after tapering. The patient's serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 429 pg/mL, while previously it was permissively controlled within the range of 140\u2013250 pg/mL. Before dialysis, his levels of serum albumin, calcium, and phosphate were 4.0 g/dL, 7.4 mg/dL, and 7.9 mg/dL, respectively. He was diagnosed with secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT). We could not exclude a relationship between MM and HPT, although his free light chain ratio was decreasing.\nCT showed widespread centrilobular opacities of both lungs () and high-density lesions along small blood vessels in the trunk and extremities (), but the mediastinum, abdominal organs, and large vessels like the thoracic and abdominal aorta were intact. A pulmonary function test demonstrated restrictive impairment with reduced diffusion capacity: the predicted forced vital capacity was 48.6%, the forced expiratory volume of the first breath was 87.9%, and the predicted diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide was 67.1%. 99mTc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate scintigraphy revealed abnormal diffuse accumulation in both upper lung fields (). Echography revealed no enlargement of the parathyroid glands.\nNext, a transbronchial lung biopsy was performed, and microscopy confirmed the presence of calcifications of the alveolar walls () and of a small vessel in the right anterior tibial muscle (). However, pathological calcification was absent from the right exterior thigh ulcer. Healing of the skin biopsy wound was delayed.\nThe patient was ultimately diagnosed with muscle and skin ischemia from CUA. He was treated with cinacalcet, and his intact PTH levels fell to a normal range. He underwent four additional cycles of Rd therapy, but ulcer infections occurred repeatedly in both thighs, occasionally progressing to sepsis. He has since been monitored closely for MM, without treatment, for four months. Meanwhile, the ulcers have achieved epithelialization after topical treatment, but his serum free light chain ratio level increased from 290 to 1532. He is currently undergoing Pd therapy (2 mg/day pomalidomide on days 1 to 21, plus 4 mg/day dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle) without any adverse events.

Nothing was found relevant about his medical condition. The patient shows a high risk for caries and also eccentric bruxism. He has partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant and multiple decay and fractured teeth. The initial approach was conservative aiming to keep the upper front by means of composite fillings (Figures and ). Then, the posterior superior quadrants needed to be restored with implants.\nThree years after, in 2017, the patient came back to the office referring pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine. New and secondary subgingival caries were found in the six front teeth. The conservative prognosis was considered poor due to the subgingival depth and extent of decay presented by the lesions from canine to canine. After having discussed the treatment options, especially the surgical lengthening of the front teeth or the orthodontic extrusion, the patient decides to replace the residual teeth with a new implant-supported bridge similar to the recently performed prostheses of the posterior areas that were judged by him as a highly satisfactory treatment. The patient preferred not to involve these restorations in the present anterior treatment and limited it to place only two implants in the lateral incisors' positions ().\nThe treatment was carried out in a staged approach. Briefly, first, we extracted the lateral incisors, using the SST, and placed two immediate implants. The four residual teeth were then prepared to be used as abutments of a temporary bridge for the purpose of maintaining the aesthetics and function of the patient during the early osseointegration period. In a further step, the four remaining teeth were also extracted using the SST, and the initial provisional bridge was replaced by the second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants. Only one out of the four abutment teeth used for the temporization of root canal treatment was needed due to a periapical infection.\nWhen placing the two immediate implants into the alveolus of the lateral incisors, a section of the buccal part of the root (about the two middle thirds) was left in place and no biomaterial was used at all. An impression of the implants was taken to have the second temporary bridge available in the second surgery. Healing abutments were then attached with the proper height for the soft tissue to cover them but at the same time facilitating the uncovering. Finally, a temporary acrylic bridge was cemented onto the four abutment teeth 13-11 and 21-23 ().\nThree months later, the implants were uncovered, the four abutment teeth were extracted, again with the SST\u2014partial extraction of the roots\u2014but this time no more implants were placed in these sockets. The first provisional cemented onto the teeth was then replaced by a second acrylic bridge screwed onto the implants though temporary abutments ().\nThe partial extraction of the canines, aiming to leave a buccal slice of the root, was so hard to perform, and further instrumentation would lead to the socket destruction that a decision was intraoperatively made and a greater portion of the root, including the apex, was finally left. As the locations of the canines did not involve the implant sites, any potential complication could be addressed efficiently.\nOne month later, the prosthodontic phase was undertaken. Little if any differences in the buccal tissue volume and no noticeable aesthetic impact could be found after the multiple extractions (). The desired position of the incisal border was determined by various try-ins, and five months after implant surgery, the definitive prosthesis was placed. The final clinical aspect can be appreciated in the pictures (Figures and ).", "topic_list": "['knows individual\u2019s risk factors for development of condition', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'interprets laboratory or other study findings', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions']"}

The patient had undergone radiation therapy of the total body and bone marrow transplantation at age 6. Since the onset of the disease he had been receiving intravenous and oral corticosteroids. Three months post-transplantation, the patient developed lung disease secondary to graft- versus-host disease and received high doses of intravenous and oral steroids. Subsequently, the patient developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia and was treated again with high doses of intravenous and oral steroids.\nPhysical examination revealed a small for his age Cushingoid boy with severe loss of muscle bulk due to steroid-induced myopathy. His height was 47 inches, which lies between the 3rd and 9th centile and his weight was 54.3 lb, which lies between the 24th and 50th centile. Radiographic evaluation of the spine and hips revealed compression fractures in thoracic spine (T11, T12) and mild deformity of the femoral epiphyses (Fig. ). Because of the history of long-term corticosteroid use, BMD was measured in the lumbar spine (L1-4) [0.485 g/cm2, Z-score -1.97] and proximal femur [0.481 g/cm2] using DXA (Fig. ). Trabecular BMD was measured at the 4% distal radius using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) [109.5 mg/cm3, Z-score -2.2]. On the basis of established pediatric densitometric criteria [], a diagnosis of low bone mineral content was made and patient was started on treatment with vitamin D and calcium. Follow-up DXA studies to determine response to treatment at 12 months demonstrated collapse of the femoral head and increasing BMD (Fig. ). The lumbar spine and hip bone densities were 0.542 g/cm2, Z-score -1.46 and 0.567 g/cm2, respectively. Sequential follow-up DXA scans at 24 months showed further destruction of the femoral head and an increase in bone mass (Fig. ). The lumbar spine and hip bone densities were 0.591 g/cm2, Z-score -1.35 and 0.788 g/cm2, respectively.\nTrabecular BMD at the 4% distal radial site by pQCT at 12 and 24 months was 135.8 mg/cm3, Z-score -1.6 and 133.7 mg/cm3, Z-score -1.9, respectively. The concurrent visual assessment of the DXA images showed progressive deterioration of the left hip joint, beginning as vague osteosclerosis and becoming severe with destruction of the femoral head, suggesting the diagnosis of osteonecrosis.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions']"}

{"clinical_note": "We present the case of a 27-year-old woman who was referred to our hospital for further investigation, after worrying findings during a routine check-up performed in another hospital. Five years prior to this check-up, the patient was diagnosed with cancer of the left breast at the very young age of 22. The tumor was staged as pT2N0M0, with the histologic examination showing a poorly differentiated invasive ductal adenocarcinoma with strong estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and negative herceptin status. The treatment consisted of a wide excision and sentinel node procedure, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormonal therapy. Because of her young age, 3 cycles of cyclophosphamide-epirubicin-fluorouracil (FEC) and 3 cycles of docetaxel were given. Chemotherapy was followed by radiotherapy of the left breast up to a dose of 50 Gy, with a boost of 16 Gy on the tumor bed. Hormonal therapy consisted of a combination of tamoxifen and triptorelin. There was no relevant personal medical history, nor family history of breast cancer. Genetic analysis failed to show any BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.\nThe patient recovered well and follow-up examinations were normal. At the time of the check-up, five years after surgery, coinciding with the conclusion of the hormonal therapy, the follow-up mammogram (Fig. ) and first ultrasound showed the surgery related changes. (Fig. ) Because of her young age, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breasts was also performed (examination performed on Siemens Magnetom Symphony 1.5T), showing a multifocal nodular contrast enhancement in the retro-areolar region and the lower-outer quadrant of the right breast (Fig. ). These findings were not present on the previous MRI, performed two years after surgery. There were no clinical abnormalities in the region of this contrast enhancement. Because of the unclear etiology of these findings, the woman was referred to our department for further investigation. On ultrasonography, we were able to visualize some parenchymal distortion and an ill-defined hypoechoic lesion with a diameter around 1 cm and mild posterior acoustic shadowing in the region of the contrast enhancement on MRI (Fig. ). Because of the ultrasound and MRI findings and the patient\u2019s history of breast cancer, the examinations were categorized as BIRADS 4. An ultrasound-assisted core biopsy (4 \u00d7 14 Gauge) was performed. Histologic examination showed a dense lymphocytic infiltrate of predominantly B-lymphocytes surrounding the ductulolobular unit and the vessels, in combination with a fibrous stroma of low cellularity and an increase in fibroblasts. These findings led to a diagnosis of sclerosing lymphocytic lobulitis. No signs of malignancy were detected.\nAfter diagnosis of sclerosing lymphocytic lobulitis, follow-up consisted of a breast ultrasound every six months and a yearly mammogram and MRI of the breasts. The volume of the hypoechoic lesion on ultrasonography and the intensity of the gradual multifocal contrast enhancement on MRI have both progressively diminished on consecutive examinations, to a level where it is barely perceptible (Fig. and ).", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

A non-contrast-enhanced CT-scan was performed to exclude kidney stones. No urinary tract calculi could be revealed. However, in liver segment 7, a high-density structure was retained surrounded by a hypodense zone of 25 mm, containing small air bubbles suggestive for an intrahepatic abscess (Figure and ).

{"clinical_note": "This was a rare case of PMB-iSH in a 21-year-old female in China. In her postpartum period, the patient suffered from chest pain, fever and even coma for a fortnight. She was sent to the local hospital due to cardiac arrest by 4 times on 27th January 2017. After CPR, she regained consciousness gradually but still was in a continuous febrile state. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from the samples of blood and sputum cultures. Besides, anti-microbial therapy hadn\u2019t worked effectively since she was treated with cefepime, imipenem and tigecycline.\nThe patient was soon admitted to the emergency intensive care unit (EICU) of Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University on 26th April. Upon admissionto our hospital, she was still in fever, unconscious in a dyspneic state, and mechanical ventilation was initiated after tracheotomy with metal tracheal tube.\nA full-body computed tomography (CT) scan identified thickened pericardium, bilateral pleural effusion with multiple exudative focuses, hepatosplenomegaly and pelvic effusion in this patient. Empiric antibiotic treatment was started for Klebsiella pneumoniae infection with piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g, intravenously, q.8 h). The sample of microbial sputum culture on 29th April revealed that a large amount of multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (MDR-KP) grew, which was merely susceptible to tigecycline, sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and PMB. The infection parameters from laboratory examination increased remarkably: hypersensitive C-reactive protein 37.0 mg/L [0~ 3 mg/L] and procalcitonin 3.37 ng/mL [< 0.50 ng/mL]. In light of the above-mentioned examination results, we replaced piperacillin-tazobactam with meropenem (2 g, intravenously, q.8 h) and tigecycline (100 mg intravenously q.12 h) with the addition of colistin (1-million unit by aerosol inhalation q.8 h) on 4th May.\nAfter the adjustment for the treatment, her body temperature dropped to normal and remained stable. During this period, repeated cultures of blood, sputum, vaginal secretion and fluid drained from the hip joint were carried out. MDR-KP, susceptible to tigecycline, SMZ and PMB was detected in all the samples. On 18th May, multiple exudations were aggravated in bilateral lungs compared to that upon admission, according to a chest CT scan. As a result, PMB (500,000 units, intravenously, q.12 h) was administered at once. Four days later, there were multiple red rashes spread on the whole body skin. With the rashes fading away, SH with dark round spots was seen on 23rd May (5 days after intravenous PMB) without pain or pruritus. More dark brown spots were spread on the skin of trunk and limbs, especially on that of lower abdomen, right hand and right foot as depicted in Figs. , , and , although the skin of the head and neck was also darkened evidently. Despite this adverse event, the therapeutic regimen was still applied in consideration of MDR-KP infection of multiple organs. PMB was utilized in the same dosage until the patient was transferred back to the local hospital, and skin biopsy wasn\u2019t performed.\nOn 21st May, she suffered from diarrhea suddenly with intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) increasing to 19 cm H2O. About 500 ml black stool was found in the patient\u2019 s excrement. Her serum creatinine was elevated dramatically to 430 \u03bcmol/L [53~ 97 \u03bcmol/L], and anuria occurred. The laboratory examinations revealed the following results: the level of hemoglobin was significantly reduced to 57 g/L [113~ 151 g/L] and platelet counts 63 \u00d7 109/L [101~ 320 \u00d7 109/L]. Her liver function was impaired moderately: total bilirubin was 43.6 \u03bcmol/L [4.7~ 24 \u03bcmol/L], direct bilirubin was 26.0 \u03bcmol/L [0~ 6.8 \u03bcmol/L], and \u03b3-GT went up to 103 IU/L [7~ 64 IU/L]. The results of coagulation test were as follows: APTT 50.1 s [22.3~ 38.7 s], PT 12.9 s [10.0~ 16.0 s], TT 24.80s [14.00~ 21.00s], Fg 1.5 g/L [1.8~ 3.5 g/L], FDP 12.5 mg/L [0~ 5 mg/L] and D-Dimer 2.66 mg/L [< 0.55 mg/L]. They indicated that the patient suffered from coagulation abnormality and hyperfibrinolysis, hence disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). After phlebotomy, the transfusion of cryoprecipitate prepared from plasma frozen within 24 Hours (PF24) started immediately. Meanwhile, low-dose heparin (3 U/kg/h) was administered prudently for anticoagulation therapy. 2 days later, bleeding disappeared.

In the lung bases multiple thin-walled cysts were observed (Fig. ). Though the tumor did not demonstrate the intratumoral fat density typical for angiomyolipoma, the concomitant presence of cystic lung disease in a premenopausal woman was suggestive of spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage from a renal angiomyolipoma in a patient with lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Based on the imaging characteristics hypernephroma could not be ruled out however. Subsequent CT of the thorax, performed several days later, showed multiple thin-walled cysts of various sizes spread throughout the lung parenchyma. The lung apices and lung bases were equally involved. No nodules were present. Based on these imaging findings a definite radiological diagnosis of LAM was made (Fig. ). A brain MRI performed to rule out tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) was normal. The retroperitoneal hemorrhage was treated conservatively. The patient underwent a follow-up CT abdomen two months later. The perirenal blood had completely disappeared. The renal tumor was unchanged in volume and imaging characteristics. Once again no intratumoral fat could be detected. The patient was transferred to an academic center with expertise in interstitial lung diseases and lung transplantation for further follow-up.

Since then, she experienced severe persistent pain in the left hip. The medical history included few relevant findings, except bilateral recurrent calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff, treated with corticosteroid injections, physiotherapy and arthroscopic exploration (with debridement of the calcific deposition, bursectomy and decompression of the subacromial space). Clinical examination showed pain and significant tenderness of the trochanteric region. There was a normal, however painful, range of motion.\nA plain radiography excluded fractures, but demonstrated the presence of perithrochanteric calcifications (Fig. ). A CT-scan of the pelvis confirmed the absence of fractures, and the presence of a large, well-defined calcification of low density, 18 millimeters in diameter, located anteriorly in the gluteus medius tendon (Fig. ). Acute calcific tendinitis of the gluteus medius tendon was suggested as the cause of the patients\u2019 pain.\nSince ultrasound-guided needle lavage is a well-described therapy for hydroxyapatite depositions in the rotator cuff tendons of the shoulder, we proposed this treatment approach for this patients\u2019 calcific tendinits. An ultrasonography was performed to assess the feasibility. The calcification was demonstrated as a hyperechogenic structure in the gluteus medius tendon within reach of a needle (3,1 cm beneath the skin) (Fig. ). Reactive thickening of the overlying bursa was also seen. In consultation with the patient and the orthopedic surgeon, an ultrasound-guided needle lavage and corticosteroid injection was performed. Linisol 2% was used as local anesthetic in the subcutaneous tissue, in the overlying bursa and in the peritendinous tissue around the calcification. This reduced the pain instantaneously. A 21 Gauge long spinal needle was then inserted into the hydroxyapatite deposition. The deposition was rinsed using small syringes of linisol 1%, which were gently and alternatingly injected and aspirated. There was progressive aspiration of a large amount of white crystals into the syringes. Once no more crystals could be aspirated, the region of the calcification and the overlying bursa was infiltrated with 40 milligrams of depoMedrol, dissolved in 4 milliliters of marcaine 0,5%. The patient\u2019s symptoms resolved within a few days following the procedure, and she could quickly resume her daily activities. No follow-up imaging was performed given the good response.\n18 months later, in November 2014, the patient returned to the hospital with similar complaints, now in the right hip. The pain had an acute but non-traumatic onset. The orthopedic surgeon clinically suspected bursitis, and requested a magnetic resonance imaging-study (MRI) to confirm this hypothesis and to exclude intra-articular pathology.\nThe MRI showed extensive edema and infiltration of the soft tissue around the greater trochanter, between the proximal muscle heads of the quadriceps, and along the tensor fasciae latae muscle and around the insertion of the gluteus medius and minimus (Fig. ). A hypo-intense, sharply defined structure with a length of almost 15 millimeters and a thickness of 8 millimeters, was identified in the gluteus medius tendon. There were no abnormalities of the joint. Due to the non-traumatic onset of the pain, a rupture or elongation of the vastus intermedius muscle of the quadriceps was unlikely. Because of the history of acute calcific tendinitis of the gluteus medius tendon on the left side, we interpreted the hypo-intese intratendineous structure as a calcification, with calcific tendinitis with manifest reactive edema as the most probable diagnosis. A radiography of the right hip confirmed a large, well-defined calcification cranial to the greater trochanter (Fig. ).\nAn ultrasound-guided needle lavage of the calcification with corticosteroid injection was performed, in consultation with the referring orthopedic surgeon and the patient (Fig. ). This procedure was carried out the same way as 18 months earlier on the left side. There was a similar good clinical response to the procedure (i.e. nearly complete alleviation of the pain within days and eventually a complete pain-free state), so no follow-up imaging was performed.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Two months previously, he had been hospitalized for a pancreatic pseudocyst during an acute phase of a head pancreatitis. Computed tomography (CT) at that time showed extensive collection around the liver, with a communication with the pancreas. The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed a large fistula from the Wirsung to this pseudocyst, and a sphincterotomy was realized with the placement of a 7Fr 5-cm prosthesis. During follow-up, about 3 weeks after the patient\u2019s hospitalization because of pneumonia, a new increase in the biological inflammatory syndrome was noticed.\nA control radiography showed a persistent parenchymatous condensation in the middle lobula, as well as a right pleural effusion. A small, unusual aeric crescent-shaped picture was seen under the right section of the diaphragm, suggesting a pneumoperitonea (Figure ).\nCT revealed that the size of the pseudocyst had decreased significantly, and a large amount of gas was observed inside the cyst, suggestive of spontaneous fistula. A distal bronchi communicating by a fistulous way to the pseudocyst was visualized (Figure ). Multiples areas of centrilobular nodules with a linear branching (tree-in-bud pattern) in the right inferior lobula and a condensation with air bronchogram in the middle lobula were also noticed (Figure ). Further, the 7Fr 5-cm prosthesis placed in January had fallen in the abdomen. Based on multiple detector computed tomography (MDCT) findings, the diagnosis of pancreaticobronchial fistula was suggested and confirmed by analysis of bronchial expectorations that showed raised lipasis and amylasis.\nConservative treatment by somatostatin was instaured, and the pancreatic duct was stented with a new 10Fr 5-cm stent.

Her past medical history was significant only for hypertension and anemia. On review of her social history, she admitted to drinking six packs of beer on the weekends but denied further substance use. She denied previous treatments for her bleeding including any previous intrauterine device usage.\nUltrasonography revealed a 7 cm fundal fibroid with otherwise normal pelvic anatomy. She was initially offered medical management of her bleeding. She declined any medical treatment and strongly desired definitive surgical treatment. She then underwent a total vaginal hysterectomy with adnexal conservation. Due to the large size of the uterus, a myomectomy was performed to facilitate vaginal removal. Her postoperative hospital course was relatively uncomplicated and she was discharged home on postoperative day three.\nOn postoperative day ten, she presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for fever, worsening abdominal pain, and new onset of nausea and vomiting. In the Emergency Department, she was tachycardic and tachypneic but afebrile. Her exam was significant for abdominal tenderness to minimal palpation, vaginal cuff erythema, and significant tenderness to palpation of the vaginal cuff. Lab work showed an elevated white blood cell count. She was admitted for management of presumed pelvic infection.\nA CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained and showed a 6.2 x 9.7 cm pelvic abscess adjacent to the vaginal cuff (Figures and ).\nInterventional Radiology placed a drain into the abscess and the patient was started on IV piperacillin/tazobactam. She was transitioned to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium after four days on intravenous antibiotics and her drain was removed on hospital day 5. Vaginal wound cultures remained pending; however, due to continued clinical improvement on the oral antibiotic regimen, she was discharged home on hospital day 5 with a two-week course of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium.\nThe patient then returned for her outpatient visit approximately one week later. The results of the vaginal wound cultures revealed a large growth of Actinomyces meyeri. The patient's case was discussed with an Infectious Disease (ID) specialist who recommended an additional two-week course of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium.\nThe patient then returned to the ED on postoperative day 25 for pleuritic chest pain with mild cough but denied gynecologic complaints. She reported compliance with the oral amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium regimen. Exam and lab work were unremarkable. A chest X-ray showed left basilar heterogeneous opacities, likely subsegmental atelectasis. A CT angiogram was obtained due to concern for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The imaging was negative for a PE; however, it was concerning for possible pneumonia. The patient was discharged home with a five-day course of levofloxacin for treatment of pneumonia.\nOn postoperative day 27, the patient represented to the ED with worsening shortness of air and chest pain. Again, she reported compliance with her antibiotic prescriptions. Exam and lab work were again unremarkable. A repeat chest X-ray showed a slight progression of right basilar heterogeneous opacities thought to be infectious. Her antibiotic regimen was again discussed with ID specialists and an intravenous antibiotic regimen was felt preferable to an oral antibiotic course. She then completed an outpatient two-week course of IV ampicillin/sulbactam as recommended.\nOn postoperative day 37, a repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed near complete resolution of the previous pelvic abscess. HIV testing was obtained and returned negative result. She reported significant improvement of her symptoms.

On OCT, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was within normal limits (). In the patient\u2019s visual field, there was an inferonasal defect in the left eye corresponding to the occluded region (). The patient was treated with a single dose of 500 cc intravenous dextran-40 and 200 mg intravenous pentoxifylline. In etiologic studies, Doppler ultrasonography revealed an atherosclerotic stenosis in the right and left main carotid arteries and a calcified plaque causing luminal narrowing in the left internal carotid artery. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed second- to third-degree aortic valve regurgitation and first-degree tricuspid valve regurgitation.

On examination, VA was 6/24 in the right eye and 6/5 in the left eye. Following slit-lamp biomicroscopy and fundoscopy a diagnosis of right eye full-thickness macular hole was made and optical coherence tomography showed right eye cuff of subretinal fluid, left eye epiretinal membrane and posterior vitreous detachment. Ten years before presentation she had uneventful bilateral phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation with no other significant past ocular or medical history.\nEight weeks later, she underwent right eye pars plana vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling and cryotherapy with C3F8 12% gas tamponade. Two weeks postoperatively, she exhibited a flat retina, closed macular hole and her VA had improved to 6/18 with normal intraocular pressure (IOP). Unfortunately, 7 weeks postoperatively, she developed right eye macula-on RD due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in the inferior retina. RD repair was done within 3 days with silicone oil (Densiron 68) tamponade and retinectomy to release the PVR. After 4 months, VA of the right eye after removal of silicone oil was 6/12 with flat retina and closed macular hole.\nFour months later, her VA declined to 6/36 in the right eye and remained 6/5 in the left eye and fundus fluorescein angiogram confirmed severe right eye CMO. She underwent right eye posterior sub-Tenon\u2019s triamcinolone injection and was started on ketorolac trometamol eye drops (Acular) 3 times/day and oral acetazolamide 250 mg slow-release 2 times/day. Treatment of the CMO during the follow-up period is summarised in Table 1.

In the left eye, UCVA was counting fingers from 2 m, BCVA was 1/10 with refraction of -6.00, -14.00 \u03b1 45 and TA of 23.8 D \u03b1 93.5 (, ). Bilateral CLWR was planned for both eyes due to insufficient visual improvement with spectacles and contact lens incompatibility.\nThe borders of the area to be excised were mapped onto the cornea preoperatively under the biomicroscope light using a 27-gauge needle. Under general anesthesia, a crescent blade was used to make a crescent-shaped incision in the cornea including the area of thinning between 4-8 o\u2019clock, 1-2 mm from the limbus. Stromal dissection from the incision to just above the Descemet\u2019s membrane was done and the thinned corneal stroma was resected using a crescent blade and scissors. After ensuring the Descemet\u2019s membrane was intact, the upper and lower normal-thickness corneal tissue was reapposed using five 10/0 sutures, followed by paracentesis through the limbus to reduce intraocular pressure. The five previously placed sutures were knotted and eight 10/0 polypropylene sutures were added. Topical antibiotic (0.5% moxifloxacin, 4 times daily), topical corticosteroid (1% prednisolone acetate, 4 times daily) and artificial tear drops were prescribed postoperatively. Topography was performed at each postoperative visit. Loose sutures were replaced. The same surgical procedure was performed in the right eye 3 months after the left eye.\nOn postoperative day 15, UCVA was 5/10, BCVA of 7/10 with refraction of +1,00, -4.50 \u03b1 55 and TA was 15.3 D \u03b1 167 in the right eye and UCVA was 6/10, BCVA was 9/10 with refraction of +2.00, -4.00 \u03b1 70 and TA was 9.4 D \u03b1 10 in the left eye ().\nSlit-lamp examination at postoperative 5 months revealed a single loose suture at 5 o\u2019clock on the resection line in the left eye, a 1x2 mm area of stromal infiltrate, mild edema surrounding the infiltrate and inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber (+2 cells) (). After taking samples for direct microscopy and culture, treatment with topical fortified vancomycin 50 mg/mL 8 times daily, ceftazidime 50 mg/mL 8 times daily and 2% fluconazole 6 times daily was initiated. Direct microscopy of corneal scraping showed yeast and culture produced Candida parapsilosis. Antibiogram results indicated sensitivity to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. Based on these findings, the fortified vancomycin and ceftazidime were discontinued and treatment was continued with 2% fluconazole drops hourly and oral fluconazole 200 mg daily. Initial response to this therapy was good. However, after 5 weeks the patient exhibited enlargement of the lesion, extensive keratic precipitates throughout the cornea and hypopyon in the anterior chamber. UCVA was 2/10 and fundus examination and ultrasonography revealed no signs of endophthalmitis. Suspecting resistance to the antifungal therapy, the agent was changed to topical 0.15% amphotericin B (amph B) hourly. After taking a sample from the anterior chamber under local anesthesia, 3 injections of 7.5 \u00b5g/0.1 mL amph B were administered at 72-hour intervals. Four days after the procedure, the hypopyon disappeared, the anterior chamber reaction regressed and the lesion was diminished in size. However, after the third injection, the patient developed hyphema nearly filling the anterior chamber. The hyphema regressed on day 7, revealing lens opacification and posterior synechia at 5 o\u2019clock, just opposite the incision (). During follow-up, the patient experienced three infectious episodes with hypopyon at intervals of five to seven weeks after discontinuing antifungal therapy. Infection was controlled by resuming antifungal therapy. Lensectomy and synechotomy were performed without intraocular lens implantation while the patient continued antifungal therapy due to cataract progression and recurrence of the infection after treatment was discontinued (). At the end of the procedure, 7.5 \u00b5g/0.1 mL amph B was administered to the anterior chamber and topical antifungal therapy was continued for another month.

{"clinical_note": "A 61-year-old male had been aware of a right parotid mass for about 10 years; however, he did not seek treatment as the mass was painless. On experiencing serious right parotid pain, he visited our affiliated hospital. Physical examination revealed a painful mass in his right parotid gland of approximately 30 mm in diameter and ipsilateral facial nerve palsy of House\u2013Brackmann (HB) grade III. Laboratory findings showed a leukocyte count of 12,190/\u03bcL and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 0.18 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an enhanced irregularly shaped mass in the right parotid gland (). T1-weighted SE MR imaging of the mass showed lower intensity than that of the native parotid tissue (). T2-weighted SE MR imaging also showed intermediate signal intensity and partial hyperintensity (). At this stage, a malignant neoplasm of the parotid gland was suspected.\nNine days after the appearance of symptoms, he was referred to our hospital. On physical examination, the mass was found to be still present but the pain had eased. In addition, the facial nerve palsy showed some improvement to HB grade II. Ultrasound examination revealed an inhomogeneous, lobulated mass (approximately 30 \u00d7 25 mm) in the right parotid gland. CT showed that the tumor had become smaller than at the time of the previous scan in our affiliated hospital (). We tried ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) twice, with an initial finding of necrotic material and a subsequent finding of a large number of histiocytes and acinar cells and a small number of eosinophilic cells with no atypical findings observed. However, no definitive diagnosis was provided.\nWe suspected a malignant tumor because of the associated facial nerve paralysis and parotid pain. On the contrary, we considered the possibility of a benign tumor with inflammation due to the reduction in tumor size and pain. We planned a total parotidectomy including exeresis and reconstruction of the facial nerve. However, we also made preparations to preserve the facial nerve should a benign tumor be suggested during the surgery.\nThe patient underwent surgery at 31 days after the appearance of symptoms. A modified Blair incision was made, and a dumbbell-shaped parotid tumor, extending from the superficial to the deep lobe of the parotid gland, was identified. The buccal and marginal mandibular branches of facial nerve were pinched by the tumor (). The nerve branches were in contact with the tumor, but not involved. The temporal and zygomatic branches were present on the tumor capsule. A portion of the tumor was cut off and used for frozen section diagnosis (FSD). It was found to consist of solid and cystic components. The solid component was surrounded by a fibrous capsule, and the wall of the cyst component was lined by a stratified squamous epithelium, which did not show any atypical changes. Based on the above results, we considered the tumor to be definitely benign. We managed to keep the facial nerve away from the tumor by use of microscissors, and the tumor was removed between the zygomatic and buccal branches.\nHistopathological examination showed the tumor contained clear cells, which formed a clear boundary between the normal parotid gland tissues (). The Ki-67 labelling index was exceedingly low and the mitotic count was negative. These findings were consistent with oncocytoma of the parotid gland.\nThroughout the postoperative period, the nasalis muscle of the affected side was slightly weakened but it was completely recovered at 2 months after surgery.

Her previous history included a stroke 5 years ago (from which she had made a good recovery) and avascular necrosis of the right hip joint. Prior to this admission, her last transfusion had been 5 years ago.\nOn physical examination, the patient was febrile (38\u00b0C), pale, mildly jaundiced, tachypnoeic, and dyspnoeic with no lower limb edema. Her respiratory rate was 50 breaths/min, pulse rate was 124 bpm, and blood pressure was 124/64 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation (SPO2) was 65% on room air and 100% on oxygen. On chest examination, there were reduced breath sounds in the right base. She had no palpable enlargement of the liver or spleen.\nHemoglobin was 84 g/L, leukocytosis of 19.8 \u00d7 109/L, with a predominance of neutrophils (12.4 \u00d7 109/L), and platelets of 535 \u00d7 109/L (). From previous records, her steady-state hemoglobin was about 70 g/L. Urine culture revealed no bacterial growth after 24 hours; renal function tests and serum electrolytes were within the normal range (). A chest X-ray showed right-sided consolidation, bilateral mid-zone changes, and cardiomegaly. A diagnosis of ACS was made, but pneumonia and septicemia could not be excluded. The patient was placed on oxygen supplementation and was started on IV cefoperazone/sulbactam 2 g\u00b7bd, IV normal saline (NS) 3 L/24 hours, and oral ibuprofen; hydroxyurea and folic acid were continued. Pain was managed by syrup morphine 5 mg 4 hourly. Two units of packed red cells were cross-matched and transfused.\nAfter 7 days, the difficulty in breathing worsened, and the patient was transferred to a High Dependency Unit (HDU). Pleurocentesis was performed, and a yellowish frothy fluid was aspirated and taken for culture, biochemistry, and cytology. Culture revealed no bacterial growth after 72 hours, and the biochemistry results were normal (glucose 0.5 mol/l and protein 35 g/L). Cytology showed presence of neutrophils, histiocytes, and lymphocytes. The results of these tests as well as serum adenosine deaminase (22.7 IU/L) and ESR (10 mm/hr) were regarded as not compatible with pulmonary tuberculosis. Viral serology for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and ELISA for HIV I and II were all negative. Oral co-trimoxazole was added to her therapy as a cover for possible atypical pneumonia.\nDespite improvement in the right basal consolidation on the repeat chest X-ray, the bilateral mid-zone changes were still present and there was no improvement in her clinical condition. On day 3 in the HDU, the patient's condition deteriorated: her RR was 72/min with PR of 124 b/min and SPO2 ranging between 60 and 66% on room air. The patient was prepared for manual RCE. Prior to exchange transfusion, the hemoglobin was 95 g/L () and HbS quantified by HPLC was 66.4% (), as a result of the recent blood transfusion.\nRCE was performed in two steps 20 hours apart. In the first step, a total of 500 ml of the patient's blood was replaced by 250 ml of normal saline (NS) and 250 ml of packed red cells. The patient developed a febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction which was managed by IV paracetamol 1 g. After this initial step, the Hb was 98 g/L and HbS was 57.2% (). 12 hours after the RCE, the patient was afebrile, and the SPO2 was 83\u201388% on room air. In the second step, 450 ml of the patient's blood was exchanged with 250 ml of NS and 200 ml of packed red cells. In total, 950 ml were replaced, corresponding to an estimated 30% of the total blood volume.\nTwelve hours after the second RCE, the hemoglobin was 92 g/L and HbS was 48.9%.

Two weeks before this presentation, he was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, which was treated with 400-mg oral moxifloxacin daily for 10 days. However, persistent intractable cough did not seem to improve. Two days before this presentation, he visited the emergent department due to epigastric pain and an intractable cough. He had no nausea, vomiting or fever. Physical examination showed epigastric tenderness without guarding and rebound pain. Laboratory studies indicated a white blood cell (WBC) count 12,000 cells/mm3 with 87% neutrophils and 8% lymphocytes, hemoglobin 8.0 g/dL, alanine transaminase 35 U/L, amylase 19 U/L, total bilirubin 0.56 mg/dL, creatinine 16.7 mg/dL, sodium concentration 133 mEq/L and potassium concentration 4.2 mEq/L. Chest radiography indicated no signs of pneumonia. PD dialysate effluent analysis revealed WBC 2/\u03bcL without polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN). Abdominal ultrasonography only showed a distended gallbladder with sludge. Severe strains of abdominal muscles from persistent and intense cough were impressed. He was discharged with antitussives and analgesics.\nAt the PD clinic, his vital signs were body temperature 36 \u00b0C, heart rate 104 per minute, respiratory rate 19 per minute and blood pressure 121/91 mmHg. Physical examination confirmed diffuse abdominal tenderness with peritoneal irritation and clean exit site of PD catheter. PD dialysate effluent analysis revealed WBC 1783/\u03bcL including 50% PMN. He was diagnosed with PD peritonitis and admitted to ward. Cefuroxime and amikacin were administered intraperitoneally empirically. He had diffuse abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Daily analysis of PD dialysate effluent showed WBC counts of 1565/\u03bcL(PMN 71%) on day 2 and 3755/\u03bcL (PMN: 66%) on day 3 and 4805/\u03bcL (PMN:86%) on day 4. PD effluent culture was positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae on day 3. Cefuroxime and amikacin were replaced by Cefepime intraperitoneally. Owing to persistent symptoms, we repeated dialysate culture on Day 3 and it grew yeast-like organism on day 6. Amphotericin was administered immediately and surgery to remove the PD catheter was scheduled. On the same day, dark yellow dialysate was obtained (Fig. ). The color became green after a 24-h fast (Fig. ). An enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen only revealed a distended gallbladder with modest wall thickening and distended bowel (Fig. ).\nExploratory laparotomy was performed on day 8. Despite a thorough examination of the intestine and stomach, no perforation was identified. The gallbladder was neither reddish nor edematous. A 0.3-cm rupture was found on the fundus of gallbladder. Primary closure of gallbladder was done with external drainage. The PD catheter was removed uneventfully. After antibiotic treatment and intensive care, he recovered without sequelae. He was discharged after 37 days hospitalization and received maintenance hemodialysis three times a week.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

At admission, he was afebrile, icteric, and anemic and complained of abdominal pain due to accumulated ascites. He had none of the neurological symptoms of neuroacanthocytosis []. He was alert, with a blood pressure of 126/66 mmHg, a heart rate of 108/min, a respiratory rate of 20/min, and an SpO2 of 95% (room air). Laboratory data are shown in . He was found to have pleural fluid, ascites associated with liver cirrhosis (Child\u2013Pugh C with 12 points) and hypoalbuminemia, and chronic kidney dysfunction. His indirect bilirubin concentration and reticulocyte counts were increased, and his haptoglobin concentration was decreased, while his vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal. A blood smear showed spur cells rather than fragmented red cells (, ). Assessments of serum lipid concentrations showed markedly reduced triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, lipoprotein (a), phospholipid, apo-AI, and apo-AII concentrations (). Mild splenomegaly was noted. He was slightly diabetic with high serum glycoalbumin (21.5%; reference 11.6\u201316.4%) and showed coagulopathy, including thrombocytopenia, prolonged APTT, and hypofibrinogenemia, as well as reduced AT-III. Assessments of coagulation factors showed that factor II, V, VII, and IX activities were all reduced, while factor VIII was not. ADAMTS13 activity was within the normal range (). Blood smear preparations after incubating the patient's serum with control RBCs of the same blood type for 24 hours clearly showed formation of spur cells, indicating that this patient's dyslipidemia was responsible for spiculated control RBCs (data not shown). The patient was diagnosed with SCA.\nHe had been drinking prior to his admission; however, during his stay in the hospital for 4 weeks, he was in a state of complete abstinence. After admission, he was first treated with ascites drainage, RBC transfusions, occasional albumin, and FFP infusions. Thereafter, two courses of plasmapheresis (2,400 mL/course) were performed over 3 weeks' duration.\nThe patient's reticulocyte counts decreased from 22.4% before to 4.5% after plasmapheresis. He also experienced increases in concentrations of total cholesterol, from 121 mg/dL to 214 mg/dL; phospholipids, from 112 mg/dL to 197 mg/dL; and apo-AI, from 48 mg/dL to 89 mg/dL. However, his lipoprotein (a), LDL cholesterol, and apo-AII concentrations, all of which were low before plasmapheresis, remained unchanged after, and his serum concentrations of indirect bilirubin and LDH did not improve significantly (). Plasma fibrinogen concentrations improved rapidly after each course of plasmapheresis, but gradually declined to subnormal levels. The percentage of spur cells was unchanged or increased slightly. The patient's general condition gradually improved with the disappearance of pleural fluid and ascites, and Hb concentration >8.0 g/dL without RBC transfusions.

{"clinical_note": "A 30-year-old male, with no significant past medical history, came to the emergency department with complaints of fever and chills for a duration of 3 days. He also complained of myalgia and abdominal pain for the same duration. He reported diffuse abdominal pain, which was 6/10 in severity, nonradiating, and not related to food. He also reported 2 episodes of diarrhea without any blood or mucous, brown in color. He denied cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, night sweats, weight loss, history of trauma, extreme exercise, or any history of travel.\nHis abdominal examination was significant for abdominal tenderness in all four quadrants, but was soft and nondistended and bowel sounds were present. The rest of his examination was unremarkable. Triage vitals were significant for a temperature of 103.3\u00b0F, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 109/49, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air.\nAdmission laboratory workup revealed leukocyte count of 6.1 \u00d7 103 \u00b5L (reference range 4.5\u201311.0 \u00d7 103) with 72% neutrophils, hemoglobin of 16.2 g/dL (reference range 13.0\u201317.0), hematocrit of 48.2% (reference range 39\u201353), platelet count of 149 \u00d7 103 \u00b5L (reference range 130\u2013400 \u00d7 103), ESR of 4 mm/hr (reference range 0\u201320), BUN of 34 mg/dL (reference range 8\u201320), creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (reference range 0.4\u20131.3), potassium of 4.7 mmol/L (reference range 3.6\u20135.1), phosphorous of 3.0 mg/dL (reference range 2.4\u20134.7), aspartate aminotransferase of 1,146 IU/L (reference range 15\u201341), alanine aminotransferase of 243 IU/L (reference range 17\u201363), and creatinine kinase of 39,125 IU/L (reference range 38\u2013398). Urinalysis was significant for large blood, and urine red blood cells were 0\u20132.\nIn view of the high-grade fever, we attempted to find an infectious source to explain his history and presentation. Chest X-ray () and CT scan were obtained and showed no signs of pneumonia. Urinalysis and influenza rapid antigen test were performed and did not reveal any abnormalities. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained and did not reveal any focal sources. Stool culture with ova and parasites, blood cultures, urinary toxicology including synthetic THC (K2), HIV, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis panel, Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM antibody, urine Legionella antigen, QuantiFERON\u00ae test for tuberculosis, and TSH were all performed as well. All the test results were negative except immunoglobulin M antibodies for Mycoplasma pneumoniae that were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antibodies were initially 781 U/mL, which is considered a low positive (reference range 770\u2013950).\nOur patient was empirically started on levofloxacin and metronidazole for possible gastroenteritis initially while culture and laboratory results were pending.

This was directly followed by knee joint blockage with a limited range of motion of only 30 to 60 degrees of flexion. The patient started taking NSAID and had minimal pain relief. She reported increased pain upon standing from a sitting position and vice versa with associated tingling and numbness at the level of the calf region especially upon standing.\nOn examination, she showed good lower-limb alignment, no pain was provoked on meniscal and ligament testing, and there was an absence of muscular atrophy. Her range of motion was limited to only 30 to 60 degrees of flexion, and the patient had pain on the active range of motion. She also had pain upon active and passive extension of the knee joint with tingling and numbness over the calf region extending from the knee posteriorly. She was found to have a nonpitting edema posteriorly with moderate anterior joint effusion. On patellar examination, she felt pain originating from the posterior region of her left knee joint. To note, the patient has never had any symptoms related to her knee up until the direct fall from the standing position.\nMRI revealed a multiloculated structure arising from the synovium around the cruciate ligaments within the femoral notch extending beyond the joint capsule posteriorly with significant displacement of the popliteal vessels (Figures and ).\nIt showed evidence of synovial thickening, and on gradient echography, it showed spotty and irregular hyposignals compatible with the presence of hemosiderin. There also was associated soft tissue edema around the above-described lesion. The patient underwent arthroscopic intervention in the left knee under spinal anesthesia. The posterior compartment of the knee was reached arthroscopically through the triangular space formed by the ACL laterally, PCL medially, and the femoral notch superiorly. Total resection of the lesion was done through only anterior knee portals without taking the risk of posterior portals preventing potential neurovascular injury. The pathology report confirmed the presence of PVNS. On 6-month MRI follow-up, the previously described soft tissue enhancement suggestive of residual inflammatory changes noted within the femoral notch along the cruciate ligaments as well as posterior to the distal metaphysis at the site of the previously present lesion has decreased (Figures and ). The synovial fluid had also decreased with no evidence of hemosiderin deposits. There was no evidence of interval appearance of new susceptibility artifacts or blooming effect on the T2 gradient sequence that could correspond to evident recurrence. The compressive effect previously present on the popliteal vessels has completely disappeared with no further tingling sensation and numbness over the calf region. Clinically, patient regained full ROM on flexion extension (0\u00b0 to 135\u00b0) of the knee. The previously reported pain no longer exists, with no blocking upon flexion.

She had no medical family history, and she had not undergone any surgical intervention. She also sustained, 6 months ago, an infective endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that was successfully managed with medical treatment (an adapted 2-month antibiotherapy). Infective endocarditis was diagnosed by suggestive findings on transesophageal echocardiogram (irregular 10\u201315 mm vegetations attached to the aortic and mitral valves) and isolation of MRSA on two consecutive blood cultures. Since she had a moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation, no operative treatment was necessary according to our cardiothoracic surgery team. She was given intravenously administered antibiotics using a combination of vancomycin at 30 mg/kg per day for 8 weeks and gentamicin at 3 mg/kg per day for 5 days. No other blood cultures were performed since she was afebrile from the third week of antibiotherapy with a negative C-reactive protein (CRP) at the last week of antibiotherapy (Table ).\nAt the current presentation, a physical examination revealed a painful and tender swelling over her right SCJ, and the overlying skin was stretched and shiny without any productive sinus. Her rectal temperature was 39 \u00b0C. There was a moderate decrease in her right shoulder\u2019s range of motion. Her cardiac auscultation did not reveal any added sounds or other abnormalities.

Due to pain and deformity in the right elbow and wrist joints, he visited our hospital. Swelling and a dinner fork deformity of the right wrist joint and pronounced swelling of the right elbow joint were observed. No skin damage was observed. No findings of nerve injury or arterial injury were obtained in the right upper limb. Radiography revealed lateral dislocation of the radial head, a fracture of the proximal ulnar metaphysis, and mild bending deformation at the fracture site. In addition, fractures of the distal radius and ulna, as well as dorsal displacement of the distal fragment, were seen (). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with Bado type III Monteggia injury with ipsilateral fracture of the distal radius and ulna.\nManual reduction under nerve block was attempted on the day of injury. However, because it was difficult to maintain the reduction of the radial head, as shown in , open reduction and percutaneous procedures were performed under general anesthesia. A Kirschner wire was inserted, percutaneously, from the olecranon into the ulnar diaphysis. When the Kirschner wire was in place, the dislocation of the radial head immediately showed good reduction. Further, open reduction and fixation of the fractured distal radius and ulna were performed with Kirschner wires (). A long-arm cast was used for external fixation with the elbow in 90\u00b0 flexion and the forearm in an intermediate position.\nTwo weeks after surgery, callus formation at the fractured bone was observed. Therefore, the cast was removed, and range of motion (ROM) exercises of the elbow and wrist joints were initiated. Since bone union was achieved at 6 weeks postsurgery, the Kirschner wires were removed. Pain, ROM limitation, and lateral instability were not observed in the elbow or wrist joints at 3 months after surgery. Additionally, plain radiographs taken at the same time showed a radially convex curvature at the proximal portion of the ulna and lateral subluxation of the radial head (). However, a gradual correction in the outward displacement of the radial head was observed during the 3-year follow-up.\nTwenty-one years after surgery, the patient returned to our hospital for another disorder. At that time, we obtained informed consent to perform an examination and take radiographs of the previous Monteggia injury.

{"clinical_note": "A 77-year-old Japanese man was referred to Kochi Medical School Hospital for the treatment of liver metastases from gastric cancer. The patient\u2019s past medical history revealed that he had undergone laparoscopic total gastrectomy with D1+ regional lymph node dissection, according to Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines 30 months prior for early gastric cancer []. The primary gastric cancer located in the upper third of the stomach, measuring 2.2 cm. The final diagnosis was T1N0M0, stage IA according to the 8th International Union Against Cancer (UICC) TNM classification [], and the histological findings showed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma coexisting with a solid-type poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma that had invaded the submucosal layer to a depth of > 2 mm. There was no lymph node metastasis in 35 dissected lymph nodes, no lymphovenous invasion. Twenty-eight months after the initial operation, abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a well-defined mass measuring 4.2 cm in diameter in the spleen, and 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography combined with CT imaging showed intense FDG uptake in the splenic mass, with no evidence of further metastatic lesions in any other organ. Under the clinical diagnosis of a solitary splenic metastasis, the patient underwent open splenectomy.\nHistological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a solid-type poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma originating from the previous gastric cancer, and immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor showed no reactivity for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Therefore, the patient was treated with chemotherapy using S-1 plus oxaliplatin. S-1 was given orally twice daily for the first 2 weeks of a 3-week cycle, at a dosage of 100 mg/day, and the patient received 100 mg/m2 of intravenous oxaliplatin on day 1 of each cycle. However, abdominal CT and magnetic resonance images showed multiple liver metastases 4 months after splenectomy, and was treated with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel as second-line treatment. The patients received ramucirumab 8 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 15, plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.

The parents disclosed a similar lesion to have occurred 6 months ago in the same region, which had been excised with a scalpel by a general dentist ( to ).\nNo sutures were given, allowing it to heal by secondary intention. No other relevant medical history surfaced. On clinical examination, the \u201cboil\u201d was a sessile lesion of 1.5 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 1 cm in dimension. It exhibited a reddish hue, was fluctuant, and bled on slight examination with finger. There was no blanching or exudate seen.\nIntraoral periapical radiograph showed a radiolu-cency surrounding the developing premolar. There was also constant trauma being inflicted to this area due to grossly carious lower right molars, which impinged the area. Extraction was considered for the same to eradicate the underlying irritant.\nThe differential diagnosis for the same lesion was pyogenic granuloma, PGCG, peripheral ossifying fibroma, inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia, and peripheral odontogenic fibroma. Excision with a soft tissue diode laser was carried forth. Local anesthesia was administered to ensure minimal bleeding in the region and reduce any discomfort for the child ( to ).\nThe child\u2019s behavior rating was of Frankel rating 3 (positive). The excision was uneventful. The gingival mass was excised and sent for histopathological consideration. Vitamin E in the form of Evian oil-based capsule was topically applied. The patient\u2019s parents were asked to apply it for the following 3 days twice daily. The patient was recalled the next day and then the next week.\nThe 7-day follow-up revealed the presence of the premolar erupting and gingiva to be coral pink and unharmed. The excised lesion was analyzed under hematoxylin and eosin stain. Histological report described nodular tumor in the subepithelium separated by fibrous tissue.\nThe report stated there to be frequent multinucleated giant cells in stroma containing ovoid to spindle-shaped cells. The stroma was elaborately vascularized and contained rare inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils along with hemosiderin at the tumor periphery. Bony tissue included was histologically unremarkable. The histological features confirmed it as PGCG.\nPostoperative healing was uneventful.

{"clinical_note": "An 8-year-old boy was referred to the Pediatric Dental Clinic at the Federal University of Cear\u00e1 (Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1, Brazil) for the evaluation of a gingival enlargement of unknown duration situated in the anterior mandibular region associated with tooth pain. The patient showed normal stature and no other physical abnormalities. History of trauma, infectious diseases, or nutritional disorders was absent. Medical abnormalities or dental alterations were not observed among other members of his family. Intraoral examination revealed right mandibular malformed and hypoplastic teeth, deciduous teeth (inferior central incisors) associated with a localized gingival enlargement covered by a fibrous tissue, and teeth 83, 84, and 85 affected by caries. All other teeth were present and normal. At the first visit, clinical data were collected to establish the treatment plan and imaging exams were analyzed. However, after the return visit, the patient did not attend for dental follow-up.\nPanoramic radiograph () showed primary mandibular teeth (81, 82, 83, 84, and 85), tooth 46 and dental germs (43, 44, and 45) with \u201cghost teeth\u201d appearance due to the presence of extensive pulp chamber demarcated by thin layer of mineralized tissue in which it was not possible to observe a clear definition of enamel and dentin. In addition, it was revealed agenesis of lower incisor teeth (41 and 42) and images suggesting dental caries on teeth 84, 85, and 46.\nA CBCT scan revealed: (1) a hypodense area suggestive of a periapical lesion associated with tooth 81, which did not show signs of dental caries (); (2) remarkable difference in the pulp chamber space when comparing deciduous teeth 84 and 74 (); (3) crows of the affected teeth surrounded by large hypodense areas (); (4) presence of GTs associated with unerupted teeth 43 and 45 (). In order to provide pulp chamber volume, it was used the semi-automated segmentation tool of the free access ITK-SNAP 3.4.0\u00ae software (Cognitica, Philadelphia, USA). It was observed that the volume of the RO-positive tooth pulp chamber () was approximately 25% greater than the volume of the opposite unaffected tooth (). In addition, RO tooth was of approximately 28% shorter length than the corresponding contralateral tooth ().\nImaging exams also showed an intense radiopacity pattern in the region of the trabecular bone surrounding adjacent RO teeth in comparison with the unaffected con-tralateral region. Thus, a fractal analysis was performed aiming to analyze the mandibular trabecular pattern of both regions (). ImageJ version 1.38x software (US National Institutes of Health, nih-image) was used to perform this analysis. Initially, a region of interest (ROI) of 100 \u00d7 100 pixels above the mandibular canal was selected between the mesial roots of the tooth 46 and the unerupted tooth 45. This ROI was similarly selected for both right and left mandibular sides. Then, the procedures for calculating the fractal dimension followed the methodology described by White and Rudolph. The bone surrounding RO teeth had a fractal dimension value of 1,171, differing from the unaffected bone (value of 1.309), which indicates an altered bone microarchitecture in the mandibular region containing the RO teeth.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'interprets laboratory or other study findings', 'select most likely diagnosis']"}

The intraoral examination revealed anterior open bite, average-sized tongue, and proclination of maxillary anterior teeth; grade III mobility was seen with maxillary central incisors, and while swallowing, the tongue was placed in between maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth (tongue thrusting habit) (). The intraoral periapical radiograph revealed root resorption along the lateral and apical aspects of maxillary central incisors (). It was diagnosed based on the clinical and radiographic finding, ARR accompanied with thumb sucking, and compensated tongue thrusting habit.\nThe detailed treatment plan was formulated and explained to the mother and her consent was obtained.

{"clinical_note": "The first case is of a 65-year-old Irish woman with a background of schizoaffective disorder, which had been stable in recent years, and a medical history of chronic renal failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, arterial hypertension, previous stroke with a right arm contracture, and aortic stenosis. For her schizoaffective disorder she was on a risperidone depot and escitalopram 20 mg once a day. She was admitted medically in December 2015 to the MMUH with a urinary tract infection, acute renal failure, and deranged international normalized ratio (INR).\nThe Liaison Psychiatry service was consulted shortly after admission. The family gave a collateral history of low mood in our patient since her brother had become ill 2 months earlier and her dose of antidepressant had been increased a month earlier. On review, she was at her baseline mental state, engaging well in conversation and denying low mood, which was confirmed by the community mental health nurse, to whom the patient was well known. No changes were made to her management.\nA week later the neurology service was asked to review the patient due to altered level of consciousness. On examination she presented with waxy flexibility, negativism, new onset increased tone of her left arm, posturing, and catalepsy. Her mobility had deteriorated, with selective speech, mute episodes, and poor oral intake noted by medical staff over the preceding day. The impression was that she was suffering from acute catatonia. An magnet resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain showed no acute changes. Nasogastric (NG) feeding was established to ensure oral intake.\nThe psychiatry service was again consulted, and acute catatonia was confirmed. She was diagnosed as having schizoaffective disorder with catatonia, as per DSM-5 (Table ). A trial of lorazepam was advised for the treatment of catatonia. The dose was titrated to 3 mg per day. The dose was well tolerated and her mental state improved significantly over the following 2 weeks. She became verbally interactive again and returned to her baseline verbal interaction; her mood was euthymic and tone normalized. She was discharged to her own home at a physical baseline that compared to her pre-admission physical state and had remained so at 6-month follow-up.

{"clinical_note": "The second case is a 75-year-old Irish woman with a psychiatric history of bipolar affective disorder, stable for several years on olanzapine and valproate, enabling her to lead an independent lifestyle. There was no history of cognitive impairment. She suffered from multiple medical conditions including: atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and a recent mitral valve repair complicated by postoperative delirium.\nShe was admitted medically to a rural Irish hospital in November 2015 for management of a raised INR. During the admission she developed sudden onset left-sided weakness and altered levels of consciousness, as well as rigidity and one isolated temperature spike. The concern was raised that she may be or might have been suffering from neuroleptic malignant syndrome and her neuroleptics were stopped as a precaution (Table ). She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the MMUH in Dublin with a suspicion of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or encephalopathy. Computed tomography (CT) brain imaging was normal at the time. As neuroleptic malignant syndrome was suspected, olanzapine was stopped. However, her creatinine kinase levels were normal as was her body temperature. Hence, neuroleptic malignant syndrome was deemed to be unlikely. An electroencephalogram during admission showed changes suspicious of encephalopathy and MRI imaging showed no acute abnormality. A working diagnosis of metabolic encephalopathy was established but extensive investigations yielded no cause for the encephalopathy.\nDue to prolonged altered levels of consciousness and unexplained altered mental state, the Liaison Psychiatry service was consulted in January 2016.\nOn examination, she responded with a mouthed single word greeting, but made no other attempt at verbal interactions. She inconsistently followed the examiner with her gaze, but stared out of the window for most of the examination. On physical examination she presented with waxy resistance to passive movement and psychomotor retardation. The impression was that these features were most likely related to a catatonic exacerbation of her bipolar affective disorder, in the absence of an organic explanation. She was diagnosed as having bipolar I disorder with catatonia as per DSM-5 (Table ).\nDelirium was raised as a differential diagnosis (Table ), but she had been reviewed in September 2015 by the Liaison service, when she was delirious after her valve replacement and her presentation was distinctly different on that occasion.\nShe was initially treated with intravenously administered lorazepam, but became drowsy, with a significant drop in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). As such the treatment was abandoned. Instead, olanzapine was cautiously reintroduced, which led to a significant improvement in her mental state within days. On follow-up review, she was mildly confused but engaged well at interview, and was euthymic with no evidence of thought disorder or movement disturbance. Subsequently she was discharged back to her own home. She was not reviewed at 6-month follow-up as she was living in a rural area and was followed up in her local service.\nOf note, in 2017, the same patient was readmitted to the MMUH ICU, from the same peripheral hospital, in a very similar state to the presentation in November 2015. Again her neuroleptics had been stopped when she was acutely unwell and she developed typical traits of acute catatonia. She was trialled on lorazepam, which she did not tolerate and reinstitution of her neuroleptics brought no improvement. The therapy was then escalated to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), to which she had a dramatic response and significant improvement of her mental state.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}
{"clinical_note": "The third case is of a 68-year-old Irish woman who presented to the MMUH in April 2016 with acute laryngitis. She had a background of bipolar affective disorder which had been stable for the past 30 years on monotherapy with lithium. There had been a recent history of lithium toxicity secondary to a deterioration of her renal function, which had been managed at her local psychiatric hospital. After the episode, she had been restarted on a low dose of lithium as well as a low dose of valproate.\nOn presentation to the MMUH she was initially treated jointly by the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) team and medical team and was managed in an ICU environment due to respiratory compromise. She had no oral intake for multiple days. Once stabilized she was transferred to an acute medical ward but an acute onset confusional state with bizarre behavior was noted over a period of 2 days. Due to her psychiatric history the Liaison Psychiatry service was consulted. On review she was severely thought disordered and confused. She was only able to produce a word salad and showed echolalia. She had motor retardation, increased tone, negativism, and posturing on examination. The impression was that she was suffering from acute catatonia. Brain imaging did not reveal acute abnormalities. She was diagnosed as having bipolar I disorder with catatonia as per DSM-5 (Table ).\nAdvice was given to treat her with paliperidone. Her mental state improved slightly as a result, but she remained severely thought disordered and confused for 2 weeks. Eventually, lithium was cautiously reintroduced under close monitoring of her renal function. The reintroduction of lithium was well tolerated and she improved significantly over a 2-week period.

{"clinical_note": "The male patient was the naturally conceived son of a 34-year-old gravida 2, para 0, miscarriage 1 mother. His healthy parents were consanguineous (first-degree cousins, of Algerian origin), without history of hypertension, calcification or cardiomyopathy. Prenatal concerns included a fetal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) associated with a hydrops fetalis and a polyhydramnios, treated by one amnioreduction due to poor maternal tolerance. No other abnormality was noted on the prenatal ultrasound. Furthermore, antenatal investigations of fetal cardiomyopathy were negative or normal (enzyme disorder, maternal viral infection, normal fetal karyotype). Preterm birth was medically indicated because of an abnormal fetal heart rate: the newborn was delivered by urgent caesarean section at 29 weeks\u2019 gestation. The newborn was eutrophic (birth weight 1330 g), umbilical cord pH was 7.21; his Apgar scores were 4 at 1 min, 8 at 5 min, 10 at 10 min. Resuscitative and neonatal appropriate care were provided.\nAt birth, he presented with hydrops fetalis (oedema and mild pericardial effusion); he was not dysmorphic; postnatal echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of HCM without other heart anomalies and routine x-ray didn\u2019t show bone abnormalities. The patient developed severe hypertension a few hours after birth (mean arterial pressure > 70 mmHg, normal range: 35\u201340 mmHg). This hypertension was refractory to a triple therapy (propranolol, nicardipine, clonidine). To assess this atypical hypertension, extensive blood and urinary tests (for endocrine disease and inborn error of metabolism) were performed, but yielded negative results. A renal artery Doppler ultrasound was performed and detected extensive calcifications of the renal arteries, the abdominal aorta and its major branches. To further elucidate the extent of the calcifications, a low-dose whole-body computed tomography was performed and detected diffuse calcifications of large- and medium-sized arteries (Fig. ). The brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging was normal at term equivalent age. In view of these findings we retrospectively reviewed the chest x-ray performed at day 1 of life: it is noteworthy that calcifications were already apparent (Fig. ). Prenatal ultrasound images were also retrospectively reviewed by several radiologist experts but no arterial calcifications were detected. These singularities were consistent with GACI: the patient\u2019s genotype was analysed, and a mutation was found in the ENPP1 gene.\nThe treatment consisted of four courses of bisphosphonates administered by intravenous route on day 40 of life, on day 70 of life, on month 21 of life and at 2 years old: each course consisted of 2 or 3 disodium pamidronate infusions (0.50 mg/kg/infusion) delivered over 1 week. At 20 week-follow-up visit, 2 months after the two initial courses of bisphosphonates, the extent of the arterial calcifications was assessed by a whole body computed tomography and an almost complete resolution of the lesions was demonstrated (Fig. ). Concurrently, from 2 months-old to one-year-old, the baby developed transiently hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate level of 3.1 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L); normal infant range = 4.6\u20137.1 mg/dL and 1.5\u20132.3 mmol/L) with inappropriate urinary phosphate excretion (fractional excretion of phosphate > 5%). All other relevant markers of phosphate homeostasis were within normal range (serum 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D level, parathyroid hormone level, serum calcium level, serum alkaline phosphatase level). The infant had no bone deformities. The transient hypophosphatemia was corrected with oral phosphate supplementation and no vitamin D supplementation. Concerning cardiovascular outcome, at 2-year-old follow-up, hypertension was still treated with a triple combination of drugs: blood pressure levels were constantly above 140/80 mmHg. However, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy resolved with this treatment. The patient had normal growth and development. He had neither ocular nor cutaneous manifestations of Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE).\nThe investigation of a multi-gene panel was performed by high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Genomic DNA was processed with the TruSight One/Nextera hybrid capture method and coding regions with adjacent intronic regions of the two GACI-associated genes ENPP1 and ABCC6 were enriched by PCR (Illumina\u00ae). Subsequent analysis was conducted by massive parallel sequencing using the MiSeq Benchtop System (Illumina\u00ae). Quality criteria require a minimal coverage of 20\u00d7 for at least 97% of target regions of the investigated genes: the minimal coverage of 20\u00d7 achieved for all targeted regions was 98% with an average coverage of 172 sequences per base. For assessment of the variants, the dbSNP, ExAc, HGMD, LOVD and UniProt databases, as well as the prediction programs PredictSNP, PhDSNP, SNAP, SIFT, PolyPhen-1, PolyPhen-2, MutationTaster, SNAP, MAPP and Panther were used. Next-generation sequencing analysis of the patient\u2019s ENPP1 gene revealed a homozygous mutation c.784A > G (p.Ser262Gly). There was no mutation in the ABCC6 gene. The parents consented to undergo genetic testing. The c.784A > G (p.Ser262Gly) mutation was also present, in the heterozygous state, in the consanguineous parents. The mutation c.784A > G (p.Ser262Gly) has so far not been described in the literature and mutation databases: there are no entries for the variation in the 1000 Genomes project and the Exome Aggregation Consortium, which indicates a very low global minor allele frequency (MAF). The prediction programs PredictSNP, PhDSNP, SNAP, SIFT, PolyPhen-1, PolyPhen-2, MutationTaster and SNAP all classify the variation as pathogenic whereas the prediction programs MAPP and Panther classify the variation as benign.\nThe combination of cardiovascular findings and extensive calcifications on imaging, together with the ENPP1 mutation, confirmed the diagnosis of GACI1 in the proband.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

She had recently undergone an uncomplicated elective ACL reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft and lateral meniscus repair with a single FAST-FIX suture (Smith & Nephew, Inc., Andover, MA, USA). The surgery was performed under a general anesthetic as well as a femoral canal block as per our usual protocol. There were no intraoperative complications. Total tourniquet time was 127 minutes at 250 mmHg. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated. She was discharged later that day as her pain was well controlled and she was cleared by physiotherapy. She was encouraged to be weight-bearing as tolerated while limiting her range-of-motion to 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 of knee flexion for 6 weeks, given her meniscal repair.\nOn the day of surgery, she weighed 65.3 kg and her height was 165.7 cm. Her past medical history was significant for acne which was controlled with tetracycline. She was on no other regular medication nor did she take a birth control pill. She was a non-tobacco smoker. She had no family history of anesthetic or hematological issues.\nShe presented to our Emergency Department on postoperative day six with progressively worsening pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. Her vital signs upon presentation were: temperature, 36.8 \u00b0C; pulse, 104 beats per minute (bpm); respiration rate, 20/minute; blood pressure, 135/76 mmHg; and O2 saturation of 96% on room air. Baseline laboratory work was drawn (Table ) and a computed tomography (CT)-PE study was performed.

Anticoagulation treatment was stopped after 3 months as per Hematology.\nAt her 12-month follow-up, she was asymptomatic and found to have no concerning cardiorespiratory issues. Both an echocardiogram and a pulmonary function test were performed, and found to be within normal limits. Hematology decided not to rescan her in order to assess resolution of the PE given her clinical profile.

Results for lupus anticoagulant and anti-phospholipid syndrome as well as for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria all returned negative. Admittedly, no further testing was performed to identify causes of inherited thrombophilia (that is, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, protein C, protein S, and/or antithrombin levels), following a thorough conversation with the family, as this would not have changed treatment pathway irrespective of results.\nThe hematological team did recommend to our patient that she did not use an estrogen-containing oral contraceptive pill, favoring a progesterone-only oral contraction or a progesterone-containing intrauterine device.

According to the patient\u2019s daughter, she appeared somnolent a day prior to the admission. On the day of admission, she seemed confused with short-term memory loss, unable to recognize the daughter\u2019s face along with significant receptive aphasia, although she was alert and conversing. She was unable to perform the usual activities of daily living. Due to concern for stroke, she was brought to the ER for evaluation. She denied a headache, fever, malaise, night sweats, and loss of weight lately. She denied any chest pain, palpitations, loss of consciousness or seizure-like activity.\nIn the ER, she was afebrile with oxygen saturation of 100% on 4L of oxygen via nasal cannula, blood pressure was 157/96 mm Hg, heart rate of 92 beats per minute. Physical examination showed a middle-aged lady who was alert, oriented to name and place but not to time, along with mild receptive aphasia. Cranial nerves examination was unremarkable. Motor examination showed decreased bulk in bilateral upper extremities with moderate spasticity, tight contractures of the arms and forearms in flexed posture with some antigravity strength, bilateral lower extremity weakness with left side worse than right. Sensations were intact to light touch and pinprick in all the four extremities. Given the paucity of extremity strength, coordination and gait were difficult to assess. She scored 14 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke scale assessment. Her initial laboratory work was significant for elevated liver transaminases (aspartate transaminase 1399 U/L (normal range 13-35 U/L) and alanine transaminase 894 U/L (normal range 7-38 U/L), elevated creatine kinase of 1790 U/L and was thought to be secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Serum magnesium and phosphorous were low at 1.5 mg/dL (normal range 1.7 -2.3 mg/dL) and 1.6 mg/dL (normal range 2.7-4.8 mg/dL) respectively. Urine toxicology was positive for cocaine. She had normal prothrombin time of 10.9 seconds (normal range 9.7-13.0 seconds), an international normalizing ratio (INR) of 1.1 (normal range 0.9-1.3) and activated partial thromboplastin time of 24.7 seconds (normal range 23.0-32.4 seconds). Computerized tomography (CT) of the brain showed heterogeneous low attenuation involving the entirety of bilateral cerebellar hemispheres with associated mass effect and partial effacement of the fourth ventricle suggestive of sub-acute infarction with areas of petechial hemorrhage along with encephalomalacia in the right insular and anterior operculum (Figure ).\nThere was no evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus. Due to the concern for posterior circulation large vessel occlusion, an emergent CT angiogram of the head and neck was performed which ruled out any dissection, significant stenosis or occlusion of intracranial or extracranial cerebral vasculature with areas of non-opacification of superior sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus. Both posterior inferior cerebellar arteries were widely patent (Figure ).\nThe differential diagnosis included multifocal infarction secondary to cocaine-related vasospasm, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and infective endocarditis with septic emboli (given prior history of heroin abuse). She was admitted to the neurointensive care unit for impending obstructive hydrocephalus and was started on hypertonic saline. Neurosurgery was consulted for possible external ventricular drain placement and posterior fossa decompression. She underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain along with MR venogram which showed infarcts in the bilateral occipital lobes, both hippocampi and bilateral basal ganglia in addition to bilateral cerebellar hemispheres suspicious for an embolic phenomenon (Figure ).\nA magnetic resonance venogram ruled out dural venous sinus thrombosis. Cerebral angiography was deferred given normal CT angiography. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of 59% with no regional wall motion abnormalities. Two sets of blood cultures drawn on the day of admission showed no growth. Her ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated at 10.4 mg/L (reference range <3.1 mg/L) but erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was normal at 2 mm/hr (reference range 0-20 mm/hr). Telemetry during the course of hospitalization was unremarkable for arrhythmias. Her glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 5.4% (normal range 4.3%-5.6%), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 105 mg/dL (normal range 60-129 mg/dL). Acute hepatitis viral panel showed positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody with elevated Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 4,838,806 IU/mL. She was diagnosed with cocaine-induced bilateral posterior inferior cerebellar artery and hippocampal infarction with multifocal punctate infarcts in the bilateral posterior cerebral artery and basal ganglia secondary to severe vasoconstriction. PRES was a consideration given the significant involvement of posterior circulation and mild encephalopathy, but she did not have high blood pressure during hospitalization, denied headache, vision issues and no pattern of radiographic vasogenic edema, but rather multifocal infarcts causing mild aphasia and encephalopathy. Due to negative blood cultures, normal echocardiogram and lack of fever and other constitutional symptoms, we ruled out infective endocarditis.\nHer mental status improved during hospitalization and she was discharged to a skilled nursing facility after seven days with persisting memory problems and unable to recognize faces. Her modified Rankin scale at the time of discharge was 4, requiring assistance with most of her activities of daily living and unable to walk.

{"clinical_note": "A 35-year-old Caucasian male presented during February 2012 with a three-month history of progressive lower back pain radiating to the left leg. Dorsal spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass involving the left ilium, sacrum, and left sacroiliac joint. It was also invading the S1-S2 left neural foramen and superior sciatic notch (Figure ). Biopsy of the mass showed a small round blue cell malignant neoplasm, having a uniform site of morphology with a lobulated growth pattern with some of the cells having limited amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm. There was a strong immune positivity for CD99 but negative for desmin CD 163 and CD68. He was diagnosed with primary localized ES. The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy according to the VIVA (vincristine + ifosfamide + doxorubicin + actinomycin D) regimen. He completed radiotherapy to the primary site in August 2012 with concurrent ifosfamide and etoposide. All planned treatment was completed in January 2013. The patient was under close follow-up, and in May of 2014, he presented with multiple lung and two pleural lesions. Biopsy confirmed the lesions to be a relapse of ES with metastasis to lungs (Figures , ). In addition, pleural fluid immunohistochemical stains demonstrated the neoplastic cells to be positive for CD99 and negative for MAK-6, synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and CD56, consistent with metastatic ES. The patient received five cycles of topotecan and cyclophosphamide. A follow-up computed tomography (CT) of the chest in July 2014, before cycle 3, showed interval decrease in the metastatic lesions, consistent with chemosensitive disease. A positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan during August 2014, after five cycles of topotecan/cyclophosphamide, showed stable metastatic disease in the form of pulmonary nodules and pleural involvement. Autologous stem cells were collected during a single leukapheresis session before the first high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT). The patient received high-dose chemotherapy in October of 2014 (busulfan, 0.8 mg/kg IV (intravenous) q six hours x 16 doses; melphalan, 140 mg/m2) and received CD34+ cells 4.24 x 10 e6/kg infused as an autologous stem cell rescue. The second round of planned consolidative high-dose chemotherapy was given during July 2015 (etoposide/melphalan regimen - etoposide, IV 400 mg/m2, total three doses (Days 2, 3, 4) and melphalan, IV 100 mg/m2, one dose (on Day 1)) followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell rescue. During the first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient developed mucositis, neutropenic fever, and diarrhea secondary to Clostridium difficile colitis. After the second cycle of HDCT, the patient developed mucositis and transient elevation of liver function tests but these abnormalities resolved over a few weeks.\nHDCT achieved 12 months of progression-free survival (PFS); however, on a subsequent PET scan performed during October 2015, the patient showed disease progression. An increase in the size of the metastatic lesions was noted, along with new areas of involvement of malignancy. The patient subsequently received six cycles of pembrolizumab, an antibody against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor. Subsequent imaging studies showed a progression of the disease, and the patient subsequently received cyclophosphamide, vincristine, dactinomycin (alternating with ifosfamide), and etoposide during March of 2016. The patient developed significant toxicities, bone marrow suppression, and in the presence of progressive disease during June 2016, he chose hospice care (Figure ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "An 81-year-old male presented for consideration of vertebral augmentation due to diagnosis of stage IV, metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, and worsening back pain. Lupron therapy was initiated at diagnosis four months prior. Docetaxel treatment was planned for six cycles but was subsequently stopped after the first cycle secondary to side effects. No radiation therapy was previously given. PSA level was 120.73 at diagnosis and 0.6 before radiofrequency ablation.\nAt the first appointment, the patient reported mild back pain and required a walker but was able to ambulate without difficulty. He did have pain upon palpation of the thoracolumbar junctional level. He did not have any neurologic deficit at presentation. Computed tomography (CT) scans showed 40% compression deformity of T12. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed pathologic involvement of T12 and L1 and metastatic involvement of the epidural component, resulting in 40% spinal canal stenosis (Figure ). At this time, vertebral augmentation was recommended although it was believed the epidural component would not be addressed and Radiation Oncology would need to be consulted. In a short period of two months, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated where he was wheelchair bound due to severe pain, not controlled with NSAIDS or opioids. In addition, repeat studies showed further tumor infiltration involving T11, prompting augmentation of T11, in addition to T12 and L1.\nThe procedure was performed under monitored anesthesia care (MAC) and fluoroscopic guided imaging. Under this image guidance, 10-gauge introducer needles were advanced into the T11, T12, and L1 vertebral levels using a bilateral transpedicular approach (Figure ). A drill and osteotome were used to create cavities at the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies. Bilateral 17-gauge bipolar radiofrequency probes were advanced into the vertebral cavities and simultaneous application of radiofrequency energy was performed as part of the protocol for volumetric ablation of the vertebral bodies. These were done in serial at T11, T12, and L1 vertebral bodies for approximately 15 minutes for each level. Lastly, methylmethacrylate was injected into the vertebral bodies of T11, T12, and L1 (Figure ) for vertebral stability. No complications occurred during the surgery and the patient was discharged the same day.\nThe patient reported no pain at the three-week follow-up and he was able to ambulate without assistance and continued to increase daily activities. He also no longer required any pain medication. He continued to be pain-free at the eight-week follow-up and repeat MRI showed stable vertebral changes and complete resolution of epidural disease at the T12 and L1 level (Figure ).

{"clinical_note": "A 32-year-old pre-menopausal woman presented after a routine pap smear revealed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Subsequent cold knife cone revealed an infiltrating poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with lymphovascular invasion. A pelvic MRI with and without contrast showed a non-enhancing cervical lesion, 3.5 x 3.2 x 4.6 cm in size. The mass was T1 isointense and T2 heterogeneously intense with evidence of left parametrial extension that was palpable on bimanual exam. MRI and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT revealed no pelvic lymphadenopathy or definitive metastatic disease. She was staged as FIGO IIB and recommended to undergo concurrent chemoradiation, but ultimately was unable to receive chemotherapy due to an atypical mycobacteria pulmonary infection. She received 45 Gray (Gy) in 25 fractions to the PTV, which encompassed the GTV, cervix, parametrium, uterus, upper vagina and pelvic lymph nodes. The external bean treatment was delivered using IMRT on a Tri-Cobalt-60 MRI-guided radiotherapy system (ViewRay MRIdian, Cleveland, Ohio, United States). She was advised to have comfortable bladder filling for treatment. She tolerated external beam radiation with moderate fatigue endorsed toward the end of her treatment course and without gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or integumentary toxicities.\nShe went on to receive high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy with four intracavitary implants. On the day of the first implant, a Smit sleeve was inserted to facilitate subsequent tandem insertion. An MR-compatible, intra-uterine tandem and two 25 mm ovoids were used for each implant. Ultrasound was utilized intraoperatively to assure proper placement of the applicators. A CT scan was performed for treatment planning which was followed by an MRI study on the MRIdian system for tumor visualization (Figure ). The CT and MRI were then registered and transferred to the MIM (MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, United States) for target delineation. After contouring, the structure set was transferred to Oncentra (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) for treatment planning. For each implant, a dose of 7 Gy was prescribed to ensure 90% coverage of the HR-CTV. The patient tolerated brachytherapy without acute side effects. As of her last follow-up, 12 months after completion of radiation, she remains without evidence of disease and the only treatment-related side effect is early menopause.\nUnder an institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocol, each of the patient\u2019s 25 daily setup MRIs were retrospectively contoured to include the GTV, bladder, uterus, and rectum. The daily MRIs were registered with the planning MRI to assess organ motion. GTV motion was assessed via GTV displacements. GTV and organ volumes along with GTV and uterus displacements were determined in order to evaluate the relationship between GTV motion and bladder and rectal volumes. As seen in Figure , the GTV volume dramatically decreased throughout the course of treatment. In parallel, the amount of GTV displacement increased throughout the treatment course and was most apparent in the caudal direction. In this case, the variation of bladder and rectal filling did not correlate strongly with GTV and uterus displacement.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

He was urgently transferred to our operating room (OR) where he underwent surgical drainage of the left submandibular abscess; he was then admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) while sedated, mechanically ventilated, hemodynamically stable, and febrile (38.7 \u00b0C). Laboratory tests were noted for extensive leukocytosis (30,000 cells/ul). Immediately on ICU admission, broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic therapy (intravenously administered ceftriaxone 1 gm 12 hourly and intravenously administered metronidazole 500 mg 8 hourly) was initiated. The following day, extensive bilateral submandibular abscess collection (left >> right) and multiple cervical lymphadenopathy were shown on an urgently performed superficial ultrasonography scan and he was transferred to our OR again for exploration of deep neck abscess. He was co-managed by the dental surgery team. On the second day of admission, he had extraction of the left mandibular second and third molar teeth by the dental surgeon. A large amount of purulent fluid was drained; 3 days later cultures were positive for mixed aerobic (Gram-positive cocci, commonly streptococci) and anaerobic (Bacteroides species essentially Peptostreptococcus species) bacteria. He remained febrile (39.3 \u00b0C) with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 24.5, although hemodynamically stable. An additional chest radiograph and ultrasound scan of the soft tissue neck and chest 2 days later showed minimal collection in the anterior superior mediastina space and significant abscess in both pleural spaces (empyema thoracis), which was far greater in his left hemithorax. An urgent left closed thoracostomy tube drainage (CTTD) was performed and connected to pleurovac and suction. A large amount (approximately 800 cc) of purulent fluid, pH 7.18, was drained from his left pleural space; he was transferred back to the ICU. Bacterial culture samples of serous fluid were positive again for mixed microbial flora as above.

She had been on injectable contraception for 2 years and had regular menses for 6 months before the pregnancy. She had antenatal care at a local health center and was vaccinated with tetanus toxoid once and supplemented with iron for 3 months. She was screened for retroviral infection, hepatitis, and syphilis and it was documented nonreactive. She had no anatomic scan at early gestation. She came to Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital with the chief complaint of severe and persistent headache of a day\u2019s duration which was occipital in location associated with blurred vision and generalized body swelling of 1 week\u2019s duration. She had no other danger signs in pregnancy. Her past gynecologic history, medical history, and surgical history were uneventful. She is Amhara by ethnicity.

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture was susceptible to all anti-TB drugs, and the patient attained bacteriological remission with a sequela of visual impairment (bilateral counting finger) because of hydrocephalus that was treated with the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Although asymptomatic remnant tuberculomas were reported primarily in the bilateral ambient cistern after the completion of the anti-TB treatment (Fig. ), her symptoms remained stable, and she visited a neurosurgical clinic regularly to check the patency of the VP shunt.\nUpon admission, the patient was alert and afebrile, and the neurological examination revealed only the worsening of pre-existing visual disturbance from counting finger to light perception without meningeal irritation. The blood analysis revealed a slight elevation in CRP levels (0.37 mg/dL), and the interferon-\u03b3 release assay (T-SPOT) was positive. A chest X-ray revealed no abnormal lesions suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing revealed elevated protein levels (570 mg/dL), no pleocytosis (6/\u03bcL), and normal glucose levels (60 mg/dL), with a standard opening pressure (130 mmH2O). Notably, antigens of Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma, and Aspergillus in the CSF and the serum antibody against Taenia solium were all negative, and no elevation of soluble interleukin-2 receptor and the angiotensin-converting enzyme was observed in the CSF. Furthermore, a head CT revealed new emerging tuberculomas in the left sylvian fissure, which was accompanied by a low-density area in the left temporal lobe (Fig. ). While a contrast-enhanced axial T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed tuberculomas with a diffuse hypointense area around the left sylvian fissure, brain fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging indicated a hyperintense area around the tuberculomas in the left sylvian fissure, suggesting edematous changes (Fig. and ). Repeated mycobacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the CSF did not indicate the existence of the reactivation of CNS tuberculosis. During these 2 weeks of examination, the symptoms did not worsen without specific treatment. Based on these findings, we diagnosed these lesions as late-onset post-treatment PRs. Accordingly, we prescribed the oral administration of corticosteroids (prednisolone, 30 mg/day, 0.6 mg/kg/day), which were gradually tapered off. After 3 months of the corticosteroid treatment, the tuberculomas disappeared, including those previously present in the bilateral ambient cistern, and brain edematous changes around the left sylvian fissure vanished (Fig. and ). Four months after the onset of PRs, we reduced the dosage of prednisolone to 5 mg/day; however, because a tuberculoma reappeared in the same place of the left sylvian fissure, we increased the dosage of oral prednisolone to 20 mg/day. This time, we carefully tapered off prednisolone over 1 year, and the corticosteroid treatment erased the residual tuberculoma again with no recurrence of tuberculous meningitis.

She presented with a 10-year history of progressively intense pain, cold sensitivity, and severe tenderness to palpation of the pulp of her left little finger, with no gross abnormalities of her fingers, and no previous trauma history. The pain increased when her digit was exposed to cold. Furthermore, the tip was excessively sensitive to touch, and her pain increased at night. She had seen a primary care doctor, with no definitive diagnosis. Moreover, she reported occasional intake of omeprazole for intermittent abdominal pain. She had no history of active or passive tobacco smoking or alcohol intake. She also had no past intervention. She was referred to our department for surgical excision with histopathological examination.\nA clinical examination showed a well-oriented, apyretic, and eupneic patient, with normal cardiac frequency and regular blood pressure, presenting with a painful subcutaneous nodule of approximately 1.5 cm, of firm consistency and pinkish red coloration, streaked with multiple telangiectasias on the pulp of the distal phalanx of her left little finger (Fig. ). Polarized contact dermoscopy induced peripheral clearing of the reddish color, disclosing a yellow to white background, with multiple telangiectasias on the surface (Fig. ). A neurological examination showed no signs of paresthesia or hypoesthesia in the area of the tumor, nor at a distance, with a preserved muscular and neurological function; a general examination showed no other abnormality.\nThe differential diagnosis at the time of examination included glomus tumor, schwannoma, mucoid cyst, and neurofibroma. An X-ray study was done for her left hand. No bony lesions were identified by radiographic studies (Fig. ). She did not benefit from ultrasonographic imaging or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because the diagnosis of glomus tumor was highly probable.\nSurgical intervention was performed. A paramedian volar incision was made of the pulp of the distal phalanx of her left little finger. The mass was well circumscribed and removed with blunt dissection and sent to pathology (Fig. ). It was a red soft tissue nodule of 1.5 cm in diameter and had no stalk or adherences to a joint. It was removed completely and dermoscopy of the excised tumor was performed showing yellow structureless areas surrounded by linear vessels. A histological examination confirmed a glomus tumor showing a tumor proliferation arranged around many narrow vascular clefts that circumscribed flattened endothelial cells. These vessels were surrounded by several superimposed layers of ovoid cells with round, regular nuclei and moderately acidophilic cytoplasm with imprecise boundaries (Fig. ). In places, these elements deviated from the vascular walls and spread irregularly, sometimes isolated or in small clusters, within a fibromyxoid stroma strewed with lymphocytes and some plasma cells.

Her medical history was significant for extensive endometriosis confirmed by the laparoscopy procedure and infertility. The patient had surgery followed by hormonal therapy in 2003. At initial blood testing, the results indicated normal cell count with a hemoglobin of 14 gm/dl, a total leukocyte count of 8,200/mm, and a platelet count of 3,44,000/mm. Serum urea, creatinine, bilirubin, transaminases, total cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, fasting blood glucose, C-reactive protein, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase levels, and other electrolytes were normal (). However, the serum amylase level was 198 IU/L (reference range 30\u2013110), and serum lipase increased to reach 1461 IU/L which is fivefold over the upper limit (reference range 27\u2013280). Blood pancreatic isoamylase values were also abnormal. As the abnormal pancreatic enzyme secretions usually denote pancreatic pathology, a deep screening for pancreatic alterations was done to find out the possible causes of the elevated levels of lipase and amylase. Serological tests for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. The tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, alpha-fetal protein, and carbohydrate antigen 125) showed normal ranges (). To exclude the common sources of hyperlipasemia and hyperamylasemia such as macroamylasemia, autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel, investigations were done and all were absolutely normal. Abdominal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed in 2011 and showed normal pancreas, liver, and biliary tree (). The patient denied weight loss, diarrhea, vomiting, cigarette smoking, or alcohol drinking. The biochemical screening of pancreatic hyperenzymemia was negative in the patient's family members. Given the interest of this case, we decided to follow-up the patient with blood and imaging tests as long as possible. Five years after the first medical consultation, the patient remained asymptomatic although the serum lipase and amylase values fluctuated widely. The amylase and lipase median values were 205.5 and 831.5 U/L, respectively (). Interestingly, the lipase concentration never exceeded the value of 2,000 U/L.

{"clinical_note": "A 53-year-old female with no previous history visited a local hospital due to right wrist pain and swelling caused by falling. She was diagnosed with a distal fracture of the right radius, underwent splinting, and returned home. When she visited the local hospital again 2 days after the injury, blister formation on the right forearm was observed, and she was referred to our hospital. The blister was observed along the splint application area () and was considered to be due to the heat and stuffiness of the splint. Plain X-ray examination revealed a distal radius fracture accompanied by dorsal displacement of the distal bone fragment (AO classification: type A2) (Figures and ). Based on the skin condition, we considered conservative treatment by external fixation using a splint or cast to be difficult, and surgery after improvement of the skin state would be more invasive due to bone union and, therefore, planned minimally invasive locking plate osteosynthesis.\nAs we previously reported, surgery was performed using the Henry approach through a 10 mm incision starting from 15 mm proximal to the radial styloid process at 9 days after injury []. In this patient, there was no skin lesion at this incision site, which allowed this surgical technique (). After reduction of the distal bone fragment using a Kirschner wire, osteosynthesis was performed using a volar locking plate (Acu-Loc 2 proximal plate standard, Nihon Medical Next, Osaka Japan) (Figures and ). After the operation, a favorable alignment was obtained (Figures and ). The wrist was immobilized postoperatively in a bulky dressing without an arm splint until the tissue swelling had decreased.\nAll muscles, vessels, and nerves of the anterior compartment\u2014except the radial artery\u2014were retracted ulnarly. The pronator quadratus was incised transversely at its distal portion and dissected off the periosteum using a periosteal elevator preserving its ulnar and radial insertions. Therefore, active finger motion was encouraged immediately after the operation and wrist mobilization was started as soon, and as much, as pain allowed. Moreover, this approach can avoid the median nerve damages during the surgery.\nSix months after the operation, favorable union of the radius was obtained. The wrist range of motion was as follows: flexion, 70\u00b0; extension, 65\u00b0; pronation, 85\u00b0; and supination, 85\u00b0. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was 1/10, and the quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (Q-DASH) score was 20.45/100. The Mayo wrist score was 85/100 (excellent).

He underwent multiple washouts and vacuum-assisted closure over a period of twelve weeks, with various antimicrobial regimes, initially receiving seven weeks of vancomycin as well as a shorter duration of ciprofloxacin. He developed a maculopapular morbilliform rash, () initially on the right arm and scalp, before spreading to cover the entire head, trunk, and upper legs () which progressed to become exfoliative and was intensely pruritic and painful (). This was accompanied by a fever and eosinophil count of 9.77 \u00d7 10\u22129/L at the highest, occurring simultaneously with the development of the rash, and which remained elevated over the course of a month of regular blood tests.

Vancomycin was discontinued immediately, and other causes for these results were excluded, with negative blood cultures, CMV, EBV, ANA, and hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV titres. There was no clinically apparent lymphadenopathy; however, a CT scan performed after the onset of symptoms showed new prominent right hilar lymph nodes, although this may have been due to metastatic cancer and not DRESS syndrome. Skin biopsy showed superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and rare eosinophils, consistent with a morbilliform drug rash. Ciprofloxacin was felt to be unlikely to be the cause of his DRESS, as he had been prescribed the drug several times in the past, as well as having a shorter duration of treatment which would not fit with the typical timeframe for DRESS, so this was continued to treat his infection.\nThe patient initially received a single dose of intravenous high-dose hydrocortisone, but due to the severity of infection and the risk of immunosuppression, he was subsequently treated exclusively with topical steroids, emollients, and antihistamines (). No liver or renal function abnormalities were noted during this time; however his eosinophils remained raised as described. He developed acute chest pain and shortness of breath four weeks after the initial rash, with new onset fast atrial fibrillation and negative troponin and creatinine kinase. A CT scan demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, as well as progression of lung and rib metastases. An echocardiogram showed mild left ventricular and right ventricular impairment and a rim of pericardial fluid.

Red blood cell antibody screen was negative. Over the next few days, the patient's platelet count continually decreased, reaching a critical low level of 10 \u00d7 103 cells/mm3 one week after admission.

The platelet product was suspended in Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose Solution, Solution A (ACD-A) and transfused on storage day 5. The red blood cell visual count was reported negative. Approximately ten minutes after the transfusion was started, the patient began to complain of severe lower back pain. The pain was described as 10/10, sharp and stabbing. No other signs or symptoms were reported, including no fever or blood pressure changes. The patient received 135 mL (50%) of the platelet product.

The patient reports the pain 1 1/2 hours later to be 5/10 and \u201cmuch better\u201d 2 hours after transfusion. A transfusion reaction work-up was initiated, which revealed a posttransfusion blood sample with visible hemolysis and 1+ positive direct antiglobulin test (C3b and C3d positive; IgG negative). No eluate was performed due to absence of detectable IgG on the posttransfusion DAT sample. Pretransfusion blood sample showed no hemolysis, and pretransfusion DAT was negative. Subsequent Gram stain of the platelet unit revealed no organisms seen. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures of the platelet unit after transfusion showed no growth at 5 days. Initial cultures performed by the blood center also reported no growth at 5 days. No medications or fluids were infused with the product. The results of the work-up were consistent with an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction related to an apheresis platelet unit from a group A, Rh(D)-positive donor to a group B, Rh(D)-positive recipient.

{"clinical_note": "The current disease story of our 68-year-old Caucasian male started two years ago, when this patient observed a hard lesion in the anal canal, which, in the first months since he observed it, was neither officially diagnosed nor treated. Ten months after that, he underwent cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis, and the perioperative diagnostic examination revealed some suspicious lesions in the anal canal and some enlarged pelvic lymph nodes. His comorbidities included only gout, and his Karnofsky performance status was 90. He has never been treated with radiotherapy, and he had a second-degree family history for malignancies. At that time, a digital rectal examination identified mild prostatomegaly, with a palpable suspicious nodule in the left prostate lobe, without any signs of the extracapsular extension. Also, a large ulcerated mass was palpable at the dorsal anal canal wall, without lymphadenopathies in the inguinal region. Subsequent colonoscopy confirmed the presence of a suspicious lesion on the posterior anal canal, extending above up to the anorectic junction. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the regional staging confirmed an infiltrative lesion of the anal canal with a maximum diameter of 3.2 cm, with a high-grade suspicion of sphincter infiltration, and two enlarged lymphadenopathies in the mesorectum and in the right internal iliac region, respectively, both with a maximal diameter of 2 cm, which is suspicious of tumour metastases. Further, an area with a maximal diameter of 2 cm within the left prostate basis having a restricted diffusion with a lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) than that in the surrounding healthy prostate tissue, which appeared hypointense on ADC maps but hyperintense on the diffusion-weighted maps, was also described. Afterwards, biopsies confirmed a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal, as well as a moderately differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma, with a Gleason score of 7 (3 + 4) in both lobes. He resulted human immunodeficiency virus- (HIV-) negative, and his carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were 2.09 U/L (reference range = 0\u20135.0 U/L) and 0.74 ng/mL (reference range = 0\u20134.0 ng/mL), respectively. Additional staging with the whole-body computed tomography (CT) scans excluded the presence of any distant metastases. Therefore, our patient had a synchronous intermediate-risk stage IIB cT2cN0M0 prostate adenocarcinoma and stage IIIB cT2N2M0 anal canal squamous cell carcinoma.\nA multidisciplinary team which included surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists evaluated this case and passed a decision to submit the patient to the definitive concurrent radio-chemotherapy.\nRegarding this clinical entity, the current papers are \u201cblind,\u201d and at this moment, they can provide us only with one case report on early-stage I metachronous small anal canal squamous cell carcinoma (cT1N0) and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (cT1cN0) that was published in 2011 []. Due to the relative lack of experience in the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) at the time, which should be a more appropriate radiotherapy technique for managing this kind of conditions, the authors planned a conventional 3D conformal radiotherapy by using a wide anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior field arrangement with concurrent mitomycin C (12 mg/m2 i.v. bolus on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 on days 1\u20134 (week 1) and 29\u201332 (week 5) by continuous 24 h i.v. infusion). Due to the use of this technique, the prescribed doses for the anal canal carcinoma and the prostate carcinoma were 50.4 Gy and 73.8 Gy, respectively. That treatment has been well tolerated, without any significant gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicity, except for one-week treatment break, due to the moist desquamation in the bilateral inguinal and intergluteal areas.

Numerous apoptotic cells and mitotic figures with foci of necrosis were observed. The tumor cells displayed CD 20 with coexpression of CD 10 and were negative for BCL 2, BCL 6, CD 3, and CD 5. EBER in situ hybridization was also negative. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was positive for [, ] (MYC/IHG) fusion in 97% of the cells and loss of BCL2 in 96%. These results appeared to be consistent with Burkitt lymphoma.\nStaging workup was obtained which only revealed concern for extra cranial disease present at T12-L1 and L2-L3 consistent with subarachnoid nodular pial metastases on MRI of the lumbosacral spine. PET/CT disclosed no evidence of extra-CNS disease. A lumbar puncture and bone marrow biopsy were performed and found to be negative for disease. In the absence of extra-CNS disease, the patient was diagnosed with PCNSBL.\nPatient was started on IV HD-MTX (3.5 grams per meter squared) and cytarabine (2 grams per meter squared) per Ferreri regimen [] with the addition of IT MTX/cytarabine every 21 days for four cycles. Dose was reduced by 25% for cycle three due to persistent cytopenias and toxicity including renal dysfunction with delayed MTX clearance. A repeat brain MRI was obtained after 6 months which indicated complete remission with no evidence of disease ().\nFour months later, the patient began having generalized weakness with visual disturbances and headaches. A repeat brain MRI at that time revealed interval development of markedly abnormal signal in the pons extending to the midbrain and dorsal medulla. Repeat cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed rare atypical lymphocytes consistent with relapse of lymphoma. He underwent WBRT, receiving 30 Gray (Gy) over 17 fractions with an additional boost to the midbrain lesion with 9 Gy in 8 fractions. Currently, he is disease-free at 30 months s/p diagnosis.", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "An 8-year-old girl was referred for investigation of hyperthyrotropinemia (increased TSH) and cushingoid features probably due to oral prednisolone intake prescribed for the management of her AD. The patient was prepubertal and overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) of 26.56 kg/m2. Already by the age of 6 months, our patient was diagnosed with mild atopic dermatitis which was successfully managed with emollients. As a toddler, atopic dermatitis relapses became more frequent, but the episodes were still easy to control with topical emollients and corticosteroids. Complete and thorough assessment for common allergens was negative. During breastfeeding, for almost 6 months, Vit D supplementation was not provided. After the age of 5 years though, her dermatitis worsened, and the lesions spread all over her body (SCORAD 70) []. Intense scratching of the patient, which was very difficult to alleviate with the topical use of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and oral antihistamines, caused sleep disturbances and a huge frustration to the family (). All available treatments and protocols using local and systemic drug therapeutic options including calcineurin inhibitors and methotrexate had failed to control the disease. Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy, normally not recommended for <18 yrs of age, had not been offered, tried, or discussed by her treating dermatologists. Regarding family history of other atopic conditions, the older sister was diagnosed with mild atopic dermatitis. The mother claimed latex allergy, and the father mentioned he had unclear food allergy in his childhood. Nobody else in the family suffered from asthma or allergic rhinitis.\nUpon review, we suggested a new measurement of TSH and several other laboratory tests including Vit D levels ().\nWe treated her with 0.5 mcg \u00d7 3/day calcitriol and 4000 IU/day cholecalciferol p.o. During treatment, no other medications except for local use of moisturizers were allowed. After two months, the patient's AD had improved significantly, and both the pruritus and the extent of the eczematous lesions were reduced. Then, we increased the dose to 1 mcg \u00d7 3/day calcitriol maintaining the cholecalciferol dose. At 6 months, there was almost healing of her skin with only mild existing dryness, no itch, and absent inflammation (SCORAD 10) () with signs of postinflammatory pigmentation over her skin as well. Her quality of life had dramatically improved, and from complete depression such as dressed always veiled, experiencing constant fatigue, feelings of helplessness, pessimism, and hopelessness, sleeping too much and overeating, loss of interest in things once pleasurable, and persistent sad or \u201cempty\u201d feelings, she was joyful again resuming all sports and outdoor activities she ever dreamed of. We continued the same treatment controlling every 6 months the biochemical parameters related to calcium metabolism, and more specifically calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), parathormone (PTH) in serum, and Ca and Ca/creatinine (Cr) in 24-hour urine samples. For one year, the values were within the normal range, and no adverse effects were detected. At 12 months, while on calcitriol 1 mcg x 3/day, we detected an increased Ca/Cr ratio in the urine for her age, and we decided to switch from calcitriol therapy to the \u201cequivalent\u201d as far as VDR activation is concerned with paricalcitol dose, that is, 2 mcg \u00d7 3/day. Written informed consent was obtained for the off-label use of paricalcitol. Clinically, the patient remained stable () practically free of AD but hypercalciuria resolved completely (). Paricalcitol treatment is being continued for 2.5 years now with a 6-month follow-up. In the future, we will reassess a possible discontinuation of the treatment which for now is out of the question by the patient herself considering the stress, the psychological pressure, and the physical \u201cdisability\u201d she experienced due to the disease in the past, expressing fear in any relevant discussion.", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'knows individual\u2019s risk factors for development of condition', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "A one-year-old Thai boy was referred to Phramongkutklao Hospital due to subacute fever, abdominal distension, mucous diarrhea, and failure to thrive. He was born at term with uneventful pregnancy, and he is the first child of nonconsanguineous parents. There was no history of autoimmune or primary immunodeficiency disorders in the family. Intradermal BCG vaccination was inoculated at the left buttock without any reaction within 3 months of life, and intramuscular vitamin K was routinely given after birth. He was exclusively breastfed. At 3 months of age, he developed frequent vomiting and irritability. Physical examination revealed enlarged and tense anterior fontanelle. CT brain showed hyperdensity lesion size of 1.5 \u00d7 1.8 cm at left temporal lobe with perilesional edema () which was confirmed to be intracerebral hemorrhage. All hematologic, coagulation studies and biochemical laboratory tests () were consistent with deficiency of vitamin K dependent clotting factors. The cause of vitamin K deficiency in this patient was presumed to be caused by malabsorption mechanism. Therefore, intravenous vitamin K was given for 3 days at initial presentation, and the coagulogram data was corrected within 24 hours. One week later, the patient developed steatorrhea. Fat malabsorption was suspected as the levels of fat-soluble vitamins were evaluated (). Cystic fibrosis was excluded by the negative sweat chloride test. At 4 months of age, perianal abscess was detected and treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for 7 days without surgical drainage. However, subsequent pus culture was not performed. At the age of 6 months, lymphadenopathy of 3 cm in size at the left groin was detected. Fine needle aspiration was accordingly performed, and pus culture was found to be positive for BCG and the tuberculin skin test was positive at 15 \u00d7 20 mm. Chest X-ray revealed no pulmonary infiltration. The patient was diagnosed with BCG lymphadenitis and was treated with isoniazid and rifampicin. Interestingly, there was no history of tuberculosis contact in the family. Nevertheless, the patient did lose to follow-up which resulted in the delay of definite diagnosis in this patient.\nOn physical examination at age of 1 year, his weight was 7.8 kg (<3rd percentile) and height was 69.5 cm (<3rd percentile). Abdominal distension, moderate hepatosplenomegaly, and ascites were detected. Left inguinal lymph node was still palpated with 1.5 cm in size. The site of BCG vaccination showed no induration. Physical examinations were unremarkable. Hematologic and biochemical laboratory tests were described (), and chest radiography showed consolidation at the left upper lobe (). Abdominal CT showed generalized ascites with evidence of hepatosplenomegaly. Abdominal paracentesis was performed, and the results were described (). Ascitic fluid adenosine deaminase (ADA) was performed because of suspicious of mycobacterial infection, and the result was compatibly high. The ascitic fluid PCR was positive for BCG. Disseminated BCG infection was diagnosed in our patient. IgG was slightly elevated (1,236 mg/dL) while IgM and IgA levels were normal (). Lymphocyte subset analyses revealed normal T-cell and B-cell counts. The neutrophil dihydrorhodamine (DHR) test revealed no fluorescence detection after granulocyte stimulation. The stimulation index (SI) was 1.21 which was compatible with XL-CGD ().\nFinally, the patient was diagnosed with XL-CGD accompanied with disseminated BCG infection. This clarified the clinical of fat malabsorption leading to vitamin K deficiency since 3 months of age. Treatment was started with antituberculosis including isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and amikacin. Itraconazole and co-trimoxazole were given as the prophylactic treatment. The clinical of ascites and steatorrhea was improved after 2 weeks of treatment. The DHR assay was also performed on the mother and revealed bimodal distribution compatible with the XL-CGD carrier (). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is therefore planned as the curative treatment since the mother is six months pregnant.\nAfter informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the commercial available kit as per the manufacturer's protocol. Thirteen coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of the CYBB gene were amplified by PCR using specific of primers for each exon as previously described [].

{"clinical_note": "As summarized in Figure , 7 years after a revision arthroplasty of the left hip joint, a 64-year-old woman presented with increasing pain in her left hip (admitted on day 0). No sinus tract was apparent, but a 4 cm \u00d7 3 cm skin burst with crusting was observed in the anteromedial region of the left knee (unknown cause), and the surrounding skin was red and hot, with a few pustules. Bacteria isolated from the cultured aspirate (obtained from left hip joint cavity, purulent and bloody fluid) were identified as \u201cS. aureus\u201d (strain XNO62) by routine biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene analysis. Surgical debridement was proposed, but the patient refused. Periodic dressing changes for the knee, irrigation with amikacin, injection with vancomycin for the hip joint, and systemic applications of amikacin and vancomycin were performed. The patient was discharged (day 7) after clinical symptoms improved and infection indicators declined.\nOn day 89, the patient was readmitted with pain and swelling in the left hip. A sinus tract and effusion of canary yellow liquid were seen in the previous operative incision. Amikacin and vancomycin were administrated intravenously and radical debridement of the hip joint was performed. Although joint fluid and tissues were sampled several times, no pathogen was found until day 100, when another \u201cS. aureus\u201d strain (strain XNO106) was isolated from the periarticular tissue in left hip during an operation. Strain XNO106 formed pinpointed colonies compared to strain XNO62, suggestive of slow growth. The patient was discharged on day 115 after clinical symptoms improved and infection indicators declined. The patient continued to have frequent relapses of pain and infection of the hip afterward. For dynamic changes of laboratory data, values of white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophilic granulocyte percentage (Neu%), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were all high in the initial infection (caused by strain XNO62). In the second hospitalization, the WBC, Neu%, and CRP values were all relatively lower (increased WBC and Neu% values at day 100 might be caused by the operation), but ESR value was always high throughout the course of the infection (the patient had no hematologic disorder that may cause high ESR value).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A previously healthy 3-year-old boy showed limping with the left leg pain, and then fever 6 h later. Next morning, he was transferred to an emergency hospital because of loss of consciousness and purpuric legs. Within a couple of hours, shock vital signs emerged and ecchymoses extended over the lower extremities. The patient was admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit on cardiopulmonary assist and catecholamine support. He had atopic dermatitis and one history of pneumonia in infancy. The growth and development were normal. There was neither consanguinity nor informative family history.\nOn admission, the comatose patient showed 180/min of tachycardia and unmeasurable blood pressure on the assist ventilation. Light reflex was prompt. The body temperature was 40.1 \u00b0C. Capillary refilling time was prolonged over 2 s, while cardiopulmonary sounds were normal. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Purpura and ecchymoses expanded to the both legs with necrotic toes (Fig. ). Petechiae spread over the face, body and upper extremities. Complete blood counts showed a leukocyte count of 0.329 \u00d7 109/L with 80% neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, a hemoglobin concentration of 11.0 g/dL, and a platelet count of 3.8 \u00d7 109/L. Schizocytosis and hemoglobinuria indicated hemolysis. Serum biochemistries revealed increased levels of blood urea nitrogen (24 mg/dL, reference range [rr]: 8\u201320), creatinine (0.5 mg/dL, rr: 0.2\u20130.45), total bilirubin (1.8 mg/dL, rr: 0.3\u20130.9), aspartate aminotransferase (381 U/L, rr: 24\u201343), alanine aminotransferase (99 U/L, rr: 9\u201330), lactate dehydrogenase (1203 U/L, rr: 190\u2013365), creatine kinase (731 U/L, rr: 43\u2013270), and C-reactive protein (12.83 mg/dL, rr: < 0.04). Coagulation studies showed hypofibrinogenemia (139 mg/dL, rr: 200\u2013400), prolonged prothrombin time (PT 21.2 s, control 10\u201313.5 s) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT 53.1 s, control 26\u201341 s), and increased levels of fibrinogen degradation products (FDP 445.0 \u03bcg/mL, rr: 1\u201310) and D-dimer (142.1 \u03bcg/mL, rr: 0.15\u20131). Thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) was > 120.0 ng/mL (rr: < 4), plasmin \u03b12\u2013antiplasmin complex (PIC) was 25.2 \u03bcg/mL (rr: < 0.8) and thrombomodulin 37.7 FU/mL (rr: < 4.5). Plasma activities of protein C (13%, rr: 64\u2013131) and protein S (52%, rr: 62\u2013121) were respectively low, and those of antithrombin were normal (85%, rr: 68\u2013130). The rapid antigen tests were positive for S. pyogenes and negative for Pneumococcus. S. pyogenes, determined later as the serotype M12, was isolated from throat and peripheral blood. Sterile cerebrospinal fluid showed no pleocytosis. These determined the diagnosis of acute infectious PF with S. pyogenes-septic shock. Antibiotic and anticoagulant therapy was started on the intensive care. Next day, leg purpura and acral gangrene extended. Anticoagulation with plasma-derived activated protein C (Anact C\u00ae), gabexate mesilate, fresh frozen plasma replacement, and platelet infusion, was intensified by the addition of a direct thrombin inhibitor (argatroban), antithrombin, recombinant thrombomodulin, and low-molecular heparin. The relaxing incisions were then conducted for the compartment syndrome of both legs on the 3rd day of illness. S. pyogenes was also isolated from the debridement tissues, and the histopathology indicated absent necrosis of the fascia and necrotic alteration of the muscle without specific inflammation. The continuous infusion of penicillin G led to the negative blood culture 24 h after the start of antibiotic therapy. Under controlled sepsis and coagulopathy, continuous irrigation and debridement were repeated. On the 13th day, debridement tissues showed necrotic muscle and fascia with chronic inflammatory changes. The histological changes indicated that the necrotic muscle tissues originated from ischemia rather than spreading infection of the fascia. The distal portions of the left metatarsal bone were finally amputated. Repeated skin-autografts resulted in the cosmetic and functional improvement of the extremities. There was no evidence of primary immunodeficiency diseases including asplenia, phagocyte disorders, hypogammaglobulinemia, immunoglobulin G subclass deficiency, complement deficiency or IRAK4/MyD88 deficiency, and absent mutation of STAT3, PI3KD, and PIK3RI genes. The genetic study of protein C or Factor V Leiden excluded heritable thrombophilia. He lives an active life for walking rehabilitation with no delayed development at 6 years of age. The isolated strain possessed T12 and M12 antigens, and emm12.0 gene, but no mutation of csrS/R or rgg.\nTwelve reported patients with acute infectious PF with S. pyogenes infection including the present case are shown in Table . Nine patients developed at age \u2264 10 years, and the remaining three were \u2265 50 years of age. All but one cases presented with septic shock and DIC, but not necrotizing fasciitis.

She was a teacher living with her husband and two children, all healthy, in a small city. She did not smoke tobacco or consume alcohol. She had no significant past medical history, she had not suffered from any infectious disease, and she did not suffer from any chronic illness. There was no family history of similar disease or any other chronic illness. There was no history of allergy to any food or drugs. On physical examination: temperature (T) 37.5 \u00b0C, pulse (P) 82/minute, respiratory rate (R) 20/minute, blood pressure (BP) 130/80 mmHg, weight (W) 51 kg, and height (H) 154 cm. Respiratory movement and cardiac examination were normal. On abdominal examination no masses or tenderness were noted on both light and deep palpation. Her liver and spleen were not palpable. A sensory and motor system examination did not reveal any abnormality. Her neurological reflexes were normal. A routine urine examination showed: white blood cell 87/hpf (WBC2+), red blood cell 34/hpf (RBC2+), and pH 7. 0. A routine blood test showed: hemoglobin (Hb) 95 g/L. Her serum potassium was 3.2 mmol/L, calcium 2.92 mmol/L, phosphate 1.3 mmol/L, carbon dioxide combining power (CO2CP) 17.8 mmol/L, creatinine 249 \u03bcmol/L, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1147 pg/ml (Table ), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level 42.98 nmol/L with reference range (RR) of 47.7\u2013144 nmol/L, 24-hour urinary calcium 8.98 mmol/day (RR, 2.5\u20137.5 mmol/day), and 24-hour urine potassium 26.8 mmol/day. Liver and thyroid functions were all normal. Urine culture showed the presence of Escherichia coli. Renal ultrasound showed multiple stones, cysts, and calcified lesions. Computed tomography (CT) of her kidney showed MSK and polycystic kidney disease (Fig. ). Ultrasonography of her thyroid and parathyroid showed two hypoechoic nodules in the right lobe of her thyroid with the larger one of 26 \u00d7 18 mm. She was diagnosed as having MSK complicated with tertiary hyperparathyroidism and underwent right parathyroidectomy on September 18, 2012. Histopathologic examination revealed adenomatous hyperplasia of parathyroid glands (Fig. ). After surgery, her serum potassium was 3.3 mmol/L, calcium 2.81 mmol/L, phosphate 1.01 mmol/L, CO2CP 16.1 mmol/L, PTH 742.5 pg/ml, and serum creatinine 231 \u03bcmol/L (Table ). The oral form of iron and calcitriol was administered.\nIn March 2013, 6 months after resection of her right parathyroid glands she was re-hospitalized because of generalized bone pain of 1 month\u2019s duration. A routine urine examination showed: white blood cell 45/hpf (WBC1+), red blood cell 27/hpf (RBC1+), and pH 7. 5. A routine blood test showed: Hb 88 g/L. Her serum potassium was 3.1 mmol/L, calcium 2.83 mmol/L, phosphorus 1.21 mmol/L, CO2CP 19.7 mmol/L, creatinine 265 \u03bcmol/L, and PTH 1378 pg/ml (Table ). Her 24-hour urinary calcium was 8.5 mmol/L and 24-hour urinary potassium 29.6 mmol/L. A bone scintigraphy for whole body with 99mTc revealed increased activity in skull, rib, and sternum (Fig. ). Parathyroid and thyroid ultrasound showed multiple hypoechoic masses in left lobe, with largest ones being 25 \u00d7 23 mm and 22 \u00d7 20 mm. She was diagnosed as having MSK and tertiary hyperparathyroidism and underwent left lobe parathyroidectomy on March 27, 2013. A pathological examination of the resected parathyroid tissue showed parathyroid nodular hyperplasia (Fig. ). After surgery, her serum calcium was 2.25 mmol/L, phosphorus 1.07 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, CO2CP 16.8 mmol/L, PTH 47.81 pg/ml, and creatinine 257 \u03bcmol/L (Table ). Subsequently she was prescribed with oral form of iron and calcitriol at the time of discharge; later, she did not return for the scheduled follow-up visits.\nOn July 7, 2016, 4 years after parathyroidectomy she was readmitted to our hospital with the complaint of dizziness. A physical examination showed pale appearance, visible thyroid surgery scar, and mild swelling of both lower extremities. A routine urine analysis showed: white blood cell 41/hpf (WBC +) and pH 7.0. A routine blood test showed: Hb 76 g/L, potassium 4.0 mmol/L, calcium 2.09 mmol/L, phosphorus 2.37 mmol/L, CO2CP 15.6 mmol/L, serum creatinine 766 \u03bcmol/L, and PTH 766.4 pg/ml (Table ). Renal ultrasound showed MSK, multiple stones in both kidneys, and polycystic kidney disease. She was diagnosed as having MSK and tertiary hyperparathyroidism and underwent renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis). She was started on replacement therapy. At 1-year follow-up, she was undergoing hemodialysis twice a week. A routine blood test showed: Hb 80 g/L. A routine urine analysis showed: PH 7.5 and protein positive (Pro2+). Her serum potassium level was 4.2 mmol/L, calcium 2.22 mmol/L, phosphorus 1.53 mmol/L, CO2CP 26.1 mmol/L, creatinine 619 \u03bcmol/L, and PTH 546 pg/ml.\nGiven the key role of the GDNF\u2013RET interaction in kidney and urinary tract development, anomalies in these molecules are reasonable candidates for explaining a disorder such as MSK. However, mutations in RET proto-oncogene are also present in 97% of individuals with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A (MEN2A). In order to explore the possible genetic mechanisms, we analyzed the GDNF and RET genes in this patient. After obtaining informed consent from our patient, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by standard phenol\u2013chloroform procedures. All 20 exons and flanking splice sites of the GDNF and RET genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primers listed in Table .

{"clinical_note": "A 52-year-old man was first diagnosed with HIV in 1991. He was maintained on antiretroviral therapy with emtricitabine-tenofovir and raltegravir. The HIV viral load was undetectable (less than 20 copies/ml) and the CD4 count of 850 cells/uL at the time of presentation. In December 2016, he presented to the emergency department with chief complaint of diplopia. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a mass in the left orbit with involvement of the optic nerve. He was referred to ophthalmology and underwent a lateral orbitotomy and removal of the orbital mass. Pathology showed metastatic small cell carcinoma. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans were negative for any intrathoracic mass; however, there were multiple liver lesions and a large pancreatic tail mass. Given these findings his final diagnosis was extrapulmonary high-grade small cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Next Generation Sequencing of his tumor showed an intermediate tumor mutation burden with 9 mutations/megabases and deleterious alterations in TP53, MLL3, MEN1, FAT1, CDKN2A, BCORL1, BCOR, ATRX and TSC2 genes. There is currently no approved targeted therapy for any of these mutations. He was started on chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide. He had a partial response (PR) after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. He had disease progression after 6 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide. He was then started on chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (5-Fluorouracil, irinotecan, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) as second line therapy. He received four cycles but continued to have disease progression on imaging. He was then treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel but his disease continued to progress with clinical deterioration and significant abdominal pain. At that point, treatment with dual CPI therapy (nivolumab and ipilimumab) was pursued given the available data in refractory SCLC. Before the start of this therapy, his CD 4 count was 294 cells/uL with an undetectable HIV viral load (less than 20 copies/ml). He received Nivolumab 1 mg/Kg along with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. After 2 doses of the combination, he developed acute kidney injury with creatinine of 4.2 mg/dl from a baseline of 1.0. The therapy was suspended and he was admitted to the hospital and a renal biopsy was performed which showed severe drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). He was treated with high dose steroids; 500 mg of IV methylprednisolone for 3 days followed by a steroid taper. His renal function improved after 4 weeks with return of creatinine to baseline. He was then re-started on single agent Nivolumab at 1 mg/Kg and later ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg was added. The patient had significant clinical improvement soon after starting the dual CPI therapy with resolution of abdominal pain which previously required high-dose opioids. Repeat scans at 12 weeks (including MRI of the head and PET/CT scan) showed complete response (CR) as per PERCIST criteria with disappearance of all metabolically active lesions (Fig. ). Patient was continued on antiretroviral therapy. The HIV viral load was undetectable before starting the CPIs (< 20 copies/ml) and increased to a high of 175 copies/ml.

{"clinical_note": "A 21-year-old male with a history of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair (with Dacron Patch over a large ventricular septal defect (VSD)) was admitted with complaints of fever and weight loss for 2 months and left sided abdominal pain since 1 week. He was recently admitted with similar complaints to another hospital where he was found to have a right sided pneumonia and was being treated with intravenous ceftriaxone. Later, suspecting infective endocarditis, gentamicin was added but as the patient was still having persistent fevers of 40\u00b0C, he was referred to our hospital. On examination, the patient was of lean built with grade IV clubbing without cyanosis, and there were no peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis. He had a loud pansystolic murmur on the left sternal edge and had tenderness on palpation of the left upper abdomen. His initial investigations showed a high white blood cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP) (). A chest X-ray showed left mid and right lower lung zone infiltrates, and an ultrasound of the upper abdomen showed an ill-defined splenic lesion without internal vascularity suggesting either an abscess or infarct. Three sets of blood cultures were subsequently negative. Echocardiogram showed vegetation on the VSD patch along with dehiscence, a large VSD, and moderate right ventricular outflow obstruction. A CT abdomen with contrast was done which showed multiple liver, splenic, and lung abscesses with infarcted left kidney and thrombus at the bifurcation of the aorta secondary to the septic embolic phenomenon. Cardiothoracic surgery consultation was sought, and the patient underwent a redo-sternotomy and removal of vegetations from right ventricular outflow tract site, removal of Dacron Patch, and complete repair of TOF. Postoperative echocardiogram did not show any residual VSD or vegetation, only mild left ventricular dysfunction and moderately reduced right ventricle function was seen. The vegetation removed from right outflow tract and Dacron Patch was sent for bacterial, mycobacterial, and mycology cultures. Chocolate, Sheep Blood (SBA), and MacConkey Agar plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for aerobic culture and a SBA plate incubated anaerobically. For fungal culture, tissue was stabbed onto the surface of Sabouraud's dextrose (SDA), potato dextrose (PDA), and Mycosel agar plates incubated at 25\u00b0C and an additional SDA and SBA incubated at 37\u00b0C. The initial Gram stain and 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation revealed clusters of oval conidia and hyphae mistaken for yeast cells and pseudohyphae as well as septate hyphae. Patient was empirically started on intravenous amphotericin deoxycholate at 1 mg/kg (40 mg/dose), his fever gradually subsided, and the patient was discharged on amphotericin and oral voriconazole. Bacterial cultures remained negative, and a filamentous mould grew from the vegetation at 48 h that was finally identified phenotypically as Acremonium species (). It grew on all plates except MacConkey agar. Mycobacterial cultures remained negative. Susceptibilities were performed by E-test\u00ae (bioMerieux, France) on RPMI agar, and the isolate showed an MIC of >32 mcg/ml against amphotericin and 2 mcg/ml against voriconazole. After final identification amphotericin, deoxycholate was discontinued and oral voriconazole 200 mg twice daily was continued. However, treatment was discontinued at 3 months based on clinical improvement and due to inability of the patient to bear the cost of the treatment. After 2 months of stopping therapy, patient had recurrence of symptoms along with new vegetation on the pulmonary valve. Blood cultures were submitted in BD BACTEC\u2122 aerobic and anaerobic bottles and incubated in the BD BACTEC 9240 system, as BD BACTEC MYCO/F Lytic system was not available. The bottles flagged positive after 3 days of incubation and two sets of blood cultures grew Acremonium species with similar antifungal susceptibilities (). The mould was identified on the colony and microscopic morphology. It was a hyaline mould appearing in 3 days on solid media, with cream coloured wrinkled surface and an off-white to tan reverse. By day 6, the colonies became slightly floccose. On microscopic examination, the hyphae were thin, hyaline, and septate, with short nonseptate conidiophores giving rise to elliptical conidia clinging to the philaides in wet masses of 10\u201320. Molecular confirmation could not be made; however, the isolate was phenotypically differentiated from Fusarium and Phialemonium species due to colony appearance, absence of macroconidia, and septations at the base of conidiophores.\nVoriconazole was restarted and surgical excision of the pulmonary valve was performed two months later with growth of the similar fungus. The patient was continued on oral voriconazole for a period of one year with clinical improvement, improvement in inflammatory biomarkers, no residual vegetation on repeat echocardiogram, and serially negative blood cultures.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

{"clinical_note": "A 47-year-old patient with an enormous uterine leiomyoma reaching beyond the navel and up to the costal arch was admitted. During the 14 years since its detection, because of the patient's extreme fear of an abdominal incision, the myoma was merely monitored and all suggested laparotomies thus far had been refused. At the moment of admission, the patient only agreed to a minimally invasive surgery. She was informed in detail about all risks, side effects, and alternatives as well as the potential risk for an emergency open abdominal surgery. Before surgery, we performed imaging diagnostics by means of computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen ().\nWhen performing a hysterectomy of a very large uterus (>2500 g), the anatomical changes in the abdomen caused by the size of the uterus need to be taken into account. The large uterus divides the abdominal area, and only 3 narrow spaces are left to manipulate surgical instruments: between the left uterine wall and left abdominal wall, between the right uterine wall and right abdominal wall, and between the fundus uteri and liver and diaphragm. Successful surgery is only feasible when both instruments (forceps and coagulator or scissors) are in the same space simultaneously. Hence, we performed LASH with the \u201cchangeover technique\u201d as described previously []. As such, we inserted 6 trocars including 3 on the left: one trocar in the lower, one in the middle, and one in the upper abdomen, allowing access to the left narrow space ().\nThe 3 trocars on the right side were placed in a mirror-like fashion. Surgery was initiated at the patient's left side, using the upper left trocar to introduce the camera () and the other two left-located trocars to introduce forceps and coagulator or scissors.\nThe patient was slightly tilted to the opposite side to facilitate visualization and preparation of structures. For uterus manipulation and movement, we used blunt forceps and palpation probes. After parameterization and resection of the uterine adnexa on the patient's left side, the plica vesicouterina was exposed and the bladder was pushed caudally.\nNext, the surgeon and his team switched sides positioning to the right side of the patient, thus accessing the narrow space on the right side in between the right uterine wall and right abdominal wall (). Again, the patient was slightly tilted to the opposite side, enabling better exposure and preparation of organ structures.\nThe procedure continued analogically as on the left side. As was seen on the CT scan, multinodal, intraligamentary, and parametric myomas were found on the right side. Consequently, further exposure and protection of the ureter was done by visualizing followed by preparing or abscising the right adnexa, parametria, and blood vessels ().\nThe corpus uteri were removed from the abdominal cavity by power morcellation. The entire procedure lasted 4 hours and 53 minutes, of which surgery on the uterus took 2 hours and morcellation 2 hours and 53 minutes. No postoperative complications occurred, and the patient was taken to outpatient care 2 days after surgery. Before discharge, a vaginal and renal ultrasound did not reveal any conspicuous intra-abdominal findings. Because of the young age of our patient, a very slow growth of the leiomyoma (over 14 years), and negative Doppler test results before surgery, we assumed no presence of malignancy. Histological analysis of the removed specimen confirmed this assumption. Furthermore, to prevent morcellation-induced spreading of occult malignancy, the patient was alternately tilted from a head-down to head-up position, after which we extensively rinsed the abdominal cavity with Ringer's lactate solution, a routine postsurgical measure at our facility. The total weight of the uterus was 4065 g (Institute for Pathology PPO Berlin; Mona Tawfik, M.D.; 06.05.2014).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 72-year-old Caucasian female with a history of stage II lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma was treated with combination chemotherapy, including doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) with resultant remission. After seven years in remission, she developed persistent leukocytosis and anemia. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) done for the evaluation of recurrence showed a new, enlarged left axilla, right paraesophageal, right precarinal, aortopulmonary, portohepatic, peripancreatic, and pericaval lymph nodes. The report of the biopsy of the enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes via mediastinoscopy was consistent with HL. A diagnosis of recurrent stage III Hodgkin lymphoma was made. She was treated with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and doxorubicin. Although imaging showed a response to therapy, chemotherapy was discontinued after four months of treatment due to significant functional decline and poor performance status. One year after the discontinuation of chemotherapy, she presented with a productive cough and persistent choking, preventing oral intake and marked weight loss. A physical examination revealed pallor, signs of dehydration, and bibasilar crackles. Due to a high suspicion of aspiration pneumonia, she was admitted and started on intravenous antibiotics. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure ) and CT soft tissue of the neck (Figure ) with intravenous (IV) contrast showed a 7.4 x 5.6 cm cavitary lesion involving the right upper lobe with irregular wall thickening and a fistulous communication with the esophagus. Bronchoscopy with an evaluation of the bilateral bronchial tree and all subsegments showed no evidence of a fistula (Figure ). Bronchoalveolar lavage and cytology were negative. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a 4-cm long stricture in the proximal esophagus and features suggestive of a fistulous tract (Figure ). The histopathology of multiple biopsies obtained from the fistulous tract showed highly atypical cells with immunostaining positive for CD30 and PAX5 (Figure ), consistent with the involvement of esophageal tissue with Hodgkin lymphoma.

{"clinical_note": "A 77-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the hospital for an evaluation of congestive heart failure. She gave a history of progressive peripheral edema over eight months, extending up to the knees bilaterally. She felt weak, exhausted, and had lost her appetite. She denied any orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She conceded to a long-standing history of hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism but denied any history of diabetes. Initial investigations, which included a urine analysis, revealed the presence of protein and no evidence of blood. Her admitting creatinine was 148 (micromol/l); serum albumin 15 g/L, and ACR 1025 mg/mmoL (normal <2.8 mg/mmoL). She had a normal white cell count and platelets and her hemoglobin was 115 g/L.\nThe cause of proteinuria was investigated further and the findings were - serum IgG: 18.4 g/L (5.5-17.24), IgA: 0.51 g/L (0.7-3.94), IgM: 0.53 g/L (0.44-2.47). Serum-free kappa light chains were elevated: 92.3 mg/L (3.3-19.4), and free lambda was 11.7 mg/L (5.7-26.3), kappa/lambda ratio 7.89 (0.26-1.65). b2-microglobulin was 6.8 mg/L (0.0-3.4) and on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), there was a presence of an M-spike of 17.2 g/L. Serum immunofixation revealed IgG kappa, and 24-hour urine protein was 9.09 g/day (normal <150 mg/d) with 1.97 g/d of monoclonal IgG kappa. She subsequently underwent a bone marrow biopsy, which revealed 5%-10% small clonal plasma cell population and bone marrow for flow cytometry showed the presence of clonal cell population. The presence of a monoclonal protein and renal impairment raised the possibility of AL amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, immunotactoid glomerulopathy, monoclonal immune deposition disease (light chain disease and heavy chain disease), proliferative glomerulonephritis (GN) with monoclonal deposits, and paraprotein-associated C3 GN.\nShe subsequently underwent a confirmatory kidney biopsy. On light microscopy, there were 21 glomeruli, four of which were sclerosed. Congo red positive staining was identified. Electron microscopy revealed haphazardly arranged thin fibrils in the mesangium and glomerular basement membrane (Figure ). Upon further interrogation of the biopsy with liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS), a peptide profile consistent with AL (kappa) type amyloid deposit was identified. These changes were histologically consistent with a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. Clinically, she was diagnosed with AL amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome.\nDuring the biopsy, it was noted that there was a solid mass in the left kidney. We investigated it further with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, which identified a 2.1 x 1.9 cm cystic lesion (23 Hounsfield units), but in the absence of contrast, the radiologist couldn\u2019t make a further determination. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 2.3 X 2.2 cm lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney suspicious of a tumor (Figure ) and the presence of a single retroperitoneal lymph node, which was biopsied and identified to be benign with no evidence of amyloid. The biopsy of the renal mass was consistent with grade 1 renal cell carcinoma. Her inpatient stay was further complicated by progressive ascites, which required repeated paracentesis. The presence of two concurrent, yet unrelated, diseases involving the kidney led to a therapeutic dilemma. After a discussion with the oncologist, it was decided that RCC was a slow-growing carcinoma and that surgical treatment could be offered upon stabilization of her underlying amyloidosis. She was initiated on 28-day cycles of 1.2 mg/m2 of bortezomib, 500 mg of cyclophosphamide, and 20 mg of dexamethasone. Unfortunately, despite the initiation of therapy, her proteinuria worsened, leading to repetitive drainage of her ascites and, later, she became neutropenic and septic. The family later withdrew active care, and she was transitioned to comfort measures and passed away peacefully three days later.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

An F18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) scan did not indicate abnormal FDG uptake. Bronchoscopy showed the round, tan, solid endobronchial nodule reducing the lumen of the right subsegmental bronchus (B5a) (Fig. d). A bronchoscopic biopsy was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with an epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMC). Examination of otolaryngologist and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed no salivary gland pathologies. A right pulmonary middle lobectomy was performed, along with hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissections.\nThe tumor was measuring 15 mm in diameter and had a white surface; it was well-circumscribed and was present along the bronchial wall (Fig. a). On histological examinations, the tumor was located in the submucosal layer of the bronchus, oppressing the adjacent bronchioles, and partly necrotic (Fig. b, c). The tumor consisted of two different components: the duct-forming epithelial cells and outer multilayered polygonal cells with clear cytoplasm (Fig. \u2013). Duct-forming epithelial cells were positive for cytokeratin 7, while the outer cells were negative (Fig. a). The outer cells were positive for S100 protein, smooth muscle actin (SMA), p63, and cytokeratin 5/6 (Fig. \u2013), suggesting myoepithelial phenotype. Neither vascular, lymphatic, nor neural invasion was observed, and the mitotic rate is rare. The Ki-67 labeling index was less than 5% (Fig. e). No mutation was found in the KRAS or EGFR gene. We finally diagnosed the patient with P-EMC. The patient is doing well without any sign of recurrence 3 years after surgery.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows individual\u2019s risk factors for development of condition', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 29-year-old male patient was admitted to the second affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in August 2014 with complaints of toothache and fever for over 1 week. A diagnosis of acute monocytic leukemia was made and the patient received chemotherapy and antimicrobial treatment with meropenem and vancomycin. Exhibiting signs of a lung infection on September 6, 2014, he was given a combination of meropenem and isepamicin for 5 days before being discharged from the hospital. The patient was readmitted for a second round of chemotherapy on September 29 and developed a fever, but was discharged upon treatment with meropenem, isepamicin, and vancomycin for 2 weeks. Blood and sputum cultures remained negative during this period (Table ).\nThe patient received the third round of chemotherapy in November 2014. A week later, he developed a high fever (38.6 \u00b0C) and diarrhea and was again given a combination of meropenem and isepamicin. One Escherichia coli isolate, EC-1, and a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, KP-Y1, both susceptible to carbapenems, were isolated from a diarrheal fecal sample (Table ). The treatment regimen was then changed to meropenem, isepamicin, and vancomycin, and maintained for 4 days. Caspofungin was subsequently added and a carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) strain, KP2, was isolated for the first time from a fecal sample (Fig. , Table ). The symptoms of fever and diarrhea persisted, and KP2-like strains remained detectable in fecal samples until early December of 2014. The patient was then given the fourth and fifth rounds of chemotherapy in December 2014 and February 2015, respectively. Symptoms were unremarkable except for intermittent fever and knee swelling. Prophylaxis with a combination of meropenem and isepamicin, followed by meropenem and vancomycin, continued for 3 weeks after each chemotherapy round. During this period, all culture findings remained normal.\nThe patient underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in April 2015 and received prophylactic treatment with piperacillin-sulbactam. With fever and diarrhea developing soon afterwards, the treatment was reinforced by teicoplanin and posaconazole. A CRKP strain, KP3, was recoverable from a fecal sample. Diarrhea symptoms soon worsened, resulting in bloody stool and tenesmus. Meropenem treatment continued for 3 days before switching back to piperacillin-sulbactam and tigecycline. KP3 type strains remained detectable in stool, and a CRKP strain, designated as KP4, was isolated for the first time from blood in May 2015. The patient developed a high fever that reached 40 \u00b0C and was given high doses of tigecycline, isepamicin, and fosfomycin. Two more isolates, KP5 and KP6, were isolated from blood samples on the 18th and 24th of May 2015, respectively. A right liver lobe abscess was observed on May 29 when another fecal CRKP strain, designated KP7, was isolated (Fig. , Table ). Antibiotics including meropenem, tigecycline, amikacin, and voriconazole were provided but were ineffective in relieving symptoms. The patient then developed fever, diarrhea and pan-resistant sepsis. The hospital ran out of antibiotic choices and the patient was subsequently treated with tigecycline and caspofungin, which were supplemented with colistin purchased from overseas. Tigecycline was given to the patient with 100 mg delivered IV every 12 h from May 8, 2015, through June 3, 2015.\nThe combined use of colistin and multiple antibiotics intravenously and orally eventually eased the diarrheal symptom, but could not immediately clear CRKP from the bloodstream. Perianal pain, fever, and signs of liver abscess persisted in the following weeks. Colistin treatment continued until September 1, 2015, and then treatment was switched to polymyxin B. CRKP remained detectable in fecal samples and occasionally in blood until early September, when blood samples became sterile, indicating that colistin was eventually effective in eradicating CRKP strains (Fig. ). On the other hand, mcr-1-positive, colistin-resistant strains of E. coli, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter freundii were consecutively isolated from fecal samples from July 13, 2015, onwards (strains EC2-7), indicating that colistin selected its own resistance during the treatment process (Fig. , Table ).\nSeven months after the transplant, an ulcer was observed at the sacrococcygeal site. Meropenem and linezolid treatment was initiated, followed by colistin, fosfomycin (IV), and then polymyxin B (IV). Colistin treatment was started with polymyxin B with 1 million units IV every 8 h and then changed to colistin with the same dose from June 3, 2015 to November 30, 2015. During treatment, CRKP was detectable in sputum, and both CRKP and mcr-1-positive E. coli were recoverable from fecal samples in retrospective analysis. However, blood samples remained sterile. In early December of 2015, pneumonia and GI tract symptoms appeared, prompting intravenous and oral administration of polymyxin B and E. CRKP and mcr-1-positive E. coli strains continued to be detectable in fecal samples and CRKP strains could be recovered occasionally in sputum but not blood. The symptoms began to resolve a few days later and the patient was discharged on December 15, 2015, with carriage of CRKP and mcr-1-positive, colistin-resistant E. coli in stool. CRKP isolated from sputum and a fecal sample during this period were selected for further study (strains KP9 and KP10, respectively). Two mcr-1 positive E. coli isolates, which were recovered from fecal samples collected in November 2015 and designated EC-Y9 and EC-Y10, respectively, were also subjected to microbiological and genetic characterization (Fig , Table ).\nThe patient recovered gradually and remained healthy since being discharged from the hospital. To determine if mcr-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae and CRKP persisted in his GI tract, we performed fecal isolation for these organisms in October 2016. CRKP strains, but not mcr-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae, were recoverable from fecal samples. We designated these CRKP strains as KP12\u2013KP17, respectively. Another seven follow-up procedures were performed, and similar results were obtained (Fig. , Table ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "The 61-year-old Hungarian woman was referred to the out-patient clinic of the Department of Dermatology and Allergology (Szeged; Hungary). Generalized erythroderma with mild infiltration and whitish fine scales were observed on her body (Figure A). The first onset of her skin symptoms occurred in childhood and she was under regular dermatological care for 28 years. Previous phototherapy and oral acitretin (25 mg/day) therapy were not effective, while methotrexate therapy was aborted due to serious side effects. Based on clinical and histological findings (Figure B) atypical PRP phenotype was diagnosed. Since the patient developed symptoms in early childhood turning into a chronic course with no sustained clearance, our patient was classified as a PRP type V patient. The patient was not aware of any family members affected by PRP; however, both her daughter and a grandchild had psoriasis and were also under regular dermatological care.\nThe association between CARD14 gene variants and PRP has recently been reported (, ). Direct sequencing of the CARD14 coding regions of the PRP patient revealed three heterozygous missense variants: c.1641G/C p.Arg547Ser (rs2066964) in exon 14, c.2044C/T and p.Arg682Trp (rs117918077) in exon 17, and c.2458C/T p.Arg820Trp (rs11652075) in exon 20. The patient carried a splice site variant in homozygous form c.676-6G/A (rs28674001), located six nucleotides away from the 5\u2032 end of exon 7. According to the results of analysis with pathogenicity prediction tools, the p.Arg682Trp missense variant is expected to be pathogenic, whereas the other three variants are expected to be benign.\nPrevious studies suggested that CARD14 variants contribute to the development of PRP by increasing the activity of the NF\u03baB signaling pathway (, ). To investigate whether the detected CARD14 variants in the investigated PRP patient increase NF\u03baB activity, immunofluorescent (IF) staining was performed on paraffin-embedded samples of lesional and non-involved skin from the PRP patient and from healthy individuals (Figure ). IF staining of the NF\u03baB p65 subunit demonstrated that p65-positive nuclei (in 31.68% of epidermal cells) were present in the suprabasal epidermis of the lesional PRP skin, but were not present in the non-involved skin of the PRP patient or in the healthy skin samples. Moreover, analysis of fluorescence intensity revealed a stronger staining in PRP samples compared to healthy samples (Figure S2A in Supplementary Material). As an additional control group, patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis vulgaris (PASI 22.4 and PASI 4.1) were also enrolled into the study, but p65-positive nuclei were not found either in lesional or non-lesional samples from psoriatic patients (Figures S4 and S5 in Supplementary Material). Among all examined sections, p65 appeared in the nuclei in the epidermis exclusively of the lesional skin from the PRP patient.\nTo further confirm increased NF\u03baB activity in keratinocytes from the PRP patient, an NF\u03baB-luciferase reporter assay was performed. The NF\u03baB activity was significantly higher in the cultured keratinocytes of the PRP patient compared to healthy keratinocytes (Figure G).\nIn parallel, IF staining of the NF\u03baB p65 subunit was also performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from the PRP patient and healthy individuals (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). Staining was more intense in the PBMCs of the PRP patient compared to cells of healthy individuals (Figure S2B in Supplementary Material). These results demonstrated increased NF\u03baB activity in various cell types derived from the PRP patient.\nTo determine whether the increased NF\u03baB activation had any functional consequence in the PRP patient, expression and secretion of NF\u03baB-induced cytokines were determined.\nKeratinocytes of the PRP patient showed a tendency for higher basal mRNA expression and significantly higher secretion of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 compared to healthy NHEKs (Figure ). Upon LPS treatment in healthy keratinocytes mRNA expression induction was only detected for IL-1\u03b1 (Figure A).\nWe found a significantly higher basal mRNA expression of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in PBMCs of the PRP patient compared to healthy control (Figure ). In healthy PBMCs, LPS treatment significantly induced the mRNA expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 compared to the untreated control samples, while in the PRP PBMCs significant induction (p < 0.001) was observed upon LPS treatment for all examined cytokines. The induction of IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in PRP cells compared to healthy control. The unstimulated PRP PBMCs secreted IL-8, while the secretion of the other cytokines was detected only after LPS treatment. IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 were secreted at significantly higher levels in PRP cells compared to the PBMCs of healthy controls (Figure ).\nNo significant difference was found between the basal CARD14 mRNA expression of healthy and PRP keratinocytes, but in healthy keratinocytes LPS treatment decreased CARD14 expression significantly, while CARD14 levels in PRP keratinocytes were not affected (Figure E).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 70-year-old female patient was admitted with complaints of lower abdominal pain of 5 months duration. Pain was initially intermittent but steadily worsened to require management with narcotics. The patient reported constipation but denied rectal bleeding. At the time of presentation, she had urinary retention that led to the placement of an indwelling Foley catheter which revealed hematuria in the bag. She reported anorexia, nausea, abdominal bloating, and worsening of bilateral leg edema, but did not have any vomiting, hematemesis, chest pain, melena, jaundice, fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. Her CT scan showed a large heterogeneous but predominantly fatty pelvic mass compressing the bowel and bladder (Figure ). Two needle core biopsies were done which revealed only benign adipose tissue. Patient was sent for upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies and MRI. She further complained of persistent lower abdominal and pelvic pain, and difficulty urinating. An MRI showed a 13 cm \u00d7 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm pelvic mass that appeared well encapsulated and nested between the rectosigmoid and sacrum. There was no suspicious lymphadenopathy (Figure ). The patient was admitted for the resection of the mass with possible colostomy. She had no history of heart disease, rheumatic fever, neurological disorder, diabetes, ulcers, asthma, tuberculosis, or kidney, liver, or thyroid disease, and had no suspicious lesions on the skin. The patient underwent bilateral ureteral stent placement followed by resection of a large 18 cm sacrococcygeal tumor with en-bloc low anterior rectosigmoid resection and Hartmann\u2019s stump.\nOn gross examination, the tumor was an unencapsulated, tan-yellow solid mass, measuring 13 cm \u00d7 13 cm \u00d7 7 cm. The cut surface was tan-yellow, with minute foci of hemorrhage. The tumor was approximately 0.3 cm away from the adjacent colon and did not involve the same.\nHistopathologically, the tumor consisted predominantly of mature adipose tissue with no atypia. Few thin and moderately thick collagen bands were noted. Foci of hemorrhage and minute areas of extramedullary hematopoiesis were identified.\nFresh tumor tissue was analyzed for chromosomal abnormalities. Routine karyotyping was done. An abnormal female karyotype was observed after examination of 20 metaphase cells. There was a clonal abnormality: all metaphases had trisomy of chromosome 5. No other abnormality was found. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of fresh tissue was done, FISH analysis summary is shown in Table . LSI DDIT3 and LSI FOXO1 dual color break-apart DNA probes (Vysis Inc.) were used to detect the rearrangements associated with the DDIT3 (CHOP) gene in the 12q13 region and FOXO1 (FKHR) gene in the 13q14 region, respectively. Two hundred interphase cells were examined for each probe. Within the limitations of the procedure, the hybridization produced a normal pattern for both probes, consistent with no translocations, deletions, or rearrangements of the DDIT3 (CHOP)/12q13 or FOXO1 (FKHR)/13q14 genes.\nFluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was performed using the Vysis MDM2 DNA probe (Abbott Molecular Inc.), which contains two probes. The LSI MDM2 DNA probe labeled spectrum Orange, specific for the MDM2 gene locus on 12q15; while the CEP 12 DNA control probe labeled spectrum Green which is specific for DNA sequence at the centromeric region of chromosome 12p11.1-q11.2. At least 50 non-overlapping cells were scored. The results of hybridization produced an MDM2:CEP12 ratio of 1.0 (Table ). This was consistent with no amplification of the MDM2 gene, ruling out the possibility of a well-differentiated (WD) liposarcoma. Further immunostaining with HMB-45 and MART-1 was also negative. Based on these findings a final diagnosis of adrenal myelolipoma was rendered.\nUpon recent follow-up (status post-resection 3.5 years), the patient was asymptomatic with no tumor recurrence.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 79-year-old woman with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and osteoporosis was referred to us with fever and leg edema. Her daily medications included glimepiride (1 mg), metformin (250 mg), olmesartan (10 mg), alfacalcidol (0.5 \u00b5g), and pitavastatin (2 mg). She had no medical history of severe hypertension. Her physical findings were unremarkable except for bilateral pitting edema of both lower extremities, a body temperature of 37.8 \u00b0C, and blood pressure of 177/105 mmHg. Although she did not receive ophthalmological examination, symptomatic visual impairment was not observed. Blood pressure was improved without additional medication after admission. Whole body computed tomography revealed multiple small lymphadenopathies in the mediastinum, axilla, and para-aorta, bilateral pleural effusion, and ascites (). Laboratory findings revealed severe thrombocytopenia (0.9 \u00d7 104/\u00b5L), along with elevated serum creatinine (1.85 mg/dL) and C-reactive protein (CRP 3.90 mg/dL). Serum IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor values were not elevated at 3.76 (normal range, 0.45 \u2013 9.96) and 15.6 (normal range 0.0 \u2013 38.3) pg/mL, respectively. ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs 13) activity was decreased to 34.4%, which was not low enough to be shown in typical TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). The ADAMTS13 inhibitor was not detected. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria (2.65 g/g creatinine) and microscopic hematuria (1 \u2013 4 red blood cells per high-power field) (). Bone-marrow aspiration was a dry tap, which indicated bone marrow fibrosis. Lymph nodes were not biopsied due to the absence of palpable lymph nodes and severe thrombocytopenia.\nHemodialysis was initiated on hospital day 7 to treat the acute kidney damage. Initial pulse therapy with methylprednisolone (mPSL; 500 mg/day for 3 days) followed by prednisolone (PSL; 40 mg/day) did not improve the thrombocytopenia, anasarca, and kidney damage. Plasma exchange was started on day 11 and continued for a total of three sessions, but a clinical response was not achieved. We diagnosed TAFRO syndrome based on the refractory anasarca, thrombocytopenia, and elevated CRP.\nIntravenous rituximab (500 mg/week for four weeks) started on hospital day 30 dramatically improved the thrombocytopenia, anasarca, and kidney damage. Hemodialysis was discontinued on hospital day 57.\nOn day 79, after thrombocytopenia had resolved, five glomeruli were obtained via kidney biopsy. Pathological findings determined by light microscopy comprised the diffuse and global duplication of basement membranes and mesangiolysis. Significant changes in arterioles, tubules, and interstitium were not found. Electron microscopy revealed subendothelial swelling of glomerular capillaries (). Immunofluorescence was negative for IgG, IgA, IgM \u03ba/\u03bb, C3, C1q, and C4.\nThree months after rituximab therapy, the thrombocytopenia, anasarca, and kidney damage did not recur while on low-dose corticosteroid therapy (PSL 5 mg/day). She was discharged from our hospital on day 159. After remission, ADAMTS13 activity was increased to 73.6%, whereas the ADAMTS13 inhibitor remained undetected.

{"clinical_note": "A 37-year-old male patient suffered from a sudden swelling in the submandibular region of the right side of the neck. The swelling started initially small and had gradually increased in size to reach 3\u20134 cm in 1 week, accompanied by pain and local fever. The patient\u2019s history was unremarkable. On extraoral examination, a single, localized, well-defined, ovoid swelling was present in the right submandibular region. On palpation, the swelling was tender, mobile, soft in consistency, compressible but not reducible. Intraoral examination showed no abnormalities. The patient was treated with an antibiotic regimen for 10 days without any significant improvement. All serological parameters were within normal limits, and testing of HBs-Ag, HCV-Ab and HIV-Ag/Ab was negative. Ultrasonography and MRI imaging of the head and neck revealed a well-defined cystic lesion with sharp regular borders measuring 39.8 mm \u00d7 19.7 mm within the right submandibular gland (Fig. ). The cyst was then enucleated under general anesthesia. Diagnosis decision was determined on histopathological observations as an inflammatory cyst in the submandibular gland. The patient was reviewed after 6 months with no evidence of recurrence as confirmed by ultrasound imaging.\nTo examine the possible involvement of IL-34 in the inflammatory response observed in this case, 5-\u03bcm thickness sections were prepared from FFBE tissue samples obtained from five different regions of the surgically resected inflammatory cyst in addition to one sample from the adjacent swollen lymph nodes (Fig. ). The expression of IL-34 was examined in these sections as compared to normal human salivary gland tissues (OriGene, Catalog No: CS811918, Case ID: CU0000012638, Sample ID: PA0000964A). Immunohistochemistry staining was performed using a specific antibody against IL-34 (EMD Millipore, Catalog No: MABT493, 1:200 dilution, 4 \u00b0C overnight) followed by secondary antibody reaction (ImmPRESS UNIVERSAL REAGENT, Anti-Mouse/Rabbit IgG PEROXIDASE Vector, Catalog No: MP-7500, 30 min at room temperature). Peroxidase/DAB was added, and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.\nBy microscopic observation, normal salivary gland tissues showed typical histology, composing of serous acini mixed with adipocytes and ducts lined by cuboidal epithelial cells (Fig. ). IL-34 expression was undetectable in serous acini or endothelium, but can be observed at very weak levels in the epithelium of the ductal system (Fig. ). As expected, IL-34 showed enhanced expression levels in tissues of the submandibular gland surrounding the inflammatory cyst (Fig. ). In particular, IL-34 showed remarkable enhancement in the cuboidal epithelial cells of the ductal system and interestingly in endothelial cells lining blood vessels within theaffected gland (Fig. ). IL-34 showed very weak staining in some areas within the adjacent swollen lymph nodes (Fig. ). The specificity of the anti-IL-34 antibody was confirmed by the specific staining of keratinocytes in normal skin (BioChain, Catalog No: T2234218, Lot. C105169) (Fig. ). Isotype control antibodies showed no staining in all samples used for IHC in this report (data not shown). To further confirm the expression of IL-34 in these samples, total RNAs were collected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples (NucleoSpin total RNA FFPE XS, Macherey-Nagel, Catalog No: 740969.10) and then reverse-transcribed into cDNA (ReverTraAce qPCR RT Master Mix, Toyobo, Catalog No: F0937K). RT-PCR analysis on these samples showed elevated levels of IL-34 mRNA in addition to several inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) in the inflammatory cyst of the submandibular gland compared to normal salivary gland tissues (Additional file : Figure S1).\nConsistent with this inflammatory condition, high expression of IL-34 in the affected gland showed a tendency to be accompanied with high infiltration of lymphocytes, as confirmed in both cases of the epithelium of the ductal system as well as endothelium of blood vessels (Fig. ). Collectively, these results indicate a potential involvement of IL-34 in the inflammatory response observed in this case of the inflamed submandibular gland.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Her past medical history was negative except for celecoxib allergy. She was married; however, her bedridden husband was under care at a nursing facility due to cerebrovascular disease, and her two adult daughters lived separately. She had been engaged in cleaning work and farming until 1 month prior to her visit to our hospital. A detailed dermatological examination revealed a confluent salmon-pink papular eruption to her upper back area (Fig. ). Further physical examination revealed mild splenomegaly and a tender right wrist. A laboratory profile revealed elevated serum ferritin levels (9692 mg/mL) but no leukocytosis. Her serum IL-18 level was markedly elevated (140,373 pg/mL); her rheumatoid factor was positive (22 IU/mL). Autoantibodies such as ANA, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, matrix metalloproteinase-3, serologic test for hepatitis B and C, urine analysis, and 2/2 sets of blood culture were negative. Chest-abdomen computed tomography showed splenomegaly.

{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 49-year-old woman who was diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) serotype 2 infection at the age of 29 years during pregnancy with her first child. She received interferon therapy, which afforded sustained virologic response. At the age of 41 years, she was diagnosed with macroglobulinemia based on a high serum IgM (2732 mg/dL) with M-protein of IgM-kappa by immunoelectrophoresis and the normal number of plasma cells in the bone marrow. She was asymptomatic and was followed-up without medication. At the age of 44 years, she developed acute kidney injury and purpura on the bilateral lower extremities with type II cryoglobulinemia, which was composed of monoclonal IgM and polyclonal IgG. Skin biopsy of the purpuric lesion revealed inflammatory infiltrates and small vessels with hyaline thrombi (Fig. ).\nRenal biopsy was avoided because of severe hypertension and thrombocytopenia, but cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis was strongly suspected. She received plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy with rituximab (RIT), cyclophosphamide (CPA), and glucocorticoid, but eventually needed hemodialysis treatment within the same year. The purpura of the extremities and neuropathy did not improve and she kept receiving double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) biweekly for cryoglobulin depletion. She requested living renal transplantation and was referred to us.\nOn our initial examination, livedo reticularis, hypothermoesthesia, and hypoalgesia on the bilateral lower extremities were observed (Fig. ). Laboratory studies indicated white blood cell count 5300/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 10.6 g/L, platelet count 21.0 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL, serum creatinine (Cr) 5.42 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 0.47 mg/dL. IgG, IgA, and IgM were 1128.9 mg/dL, 211.8 mg/dL, and 371.1 mg/dL, respectively. Complement C3 was 79.0 mg/dL (normal range: 60\u2013120 mg/dL), CH50 was 18.9 U/mL (normal range: 30\u201340 mg/dL), and rheumatoid factor (RF) was 2213.5 IU/mL. Although the recipient was negative for HCV-RNA on TaqMan quantitative assay, cryocrit was 14% and type II cryoglobulinemia was still demonstrated. As measured in our laboratory, the IgG and IgM concentrations within the cryoprecipitate (cryo-IgG and cryo-IgM) were 360.3 mg/dL and 261.3 mg/dL, respectively. An appropriate technique was necessary to get the correct value of cryoglobulin concentration, which can easily fluctuate and cause a reading error []. Blood samples were collected in pre-warmed syringes and tubes, clotted for 20 min, and centrifuged at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min; 1 mL of supernatant was collected and stored at 4 \u00b0C for 3 days. Then, the precipitate was dissolved in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline, and globulin concentration was measured. We routinely took an average of 2 or more measurements.\nBecause cryoprotein concentration was reported to correlate with the severity of symptoms and useful in monitoring response to treatment [], living renal transplantation was planned when the concentration was suppressed enough by pretransplant treatment. The pretransplant clinical course is shown in Fig. . Prednisolone (PSL), CPA, and RIT were started 50 days before the transplantation, and DFPP and splenectomy were combined. Immediately before the operation, cryo-IgG and cryo-IgM were sufficiently suppressed and cryocrit was 0%.\nThe donor was her 70-year-old mother, whose left kidney was transplanted to the recipient\u2019s right iliac fossa. During the operation, hypothermia was prevented by placing the recipient in a warm operating room and by giving warm fluid replacement and heating blankets.\nBasiliximab, PSL, CPA, and cyclosporin were used for posttransplant immunosuppression, and CPA was changed to mycophenolate mofetil 1 month after the operation (Fig. ). The cryoglobulin concentration and the CD20-positive cell counts were monitored, and DFPP and RIT infusion were performed as appropriate. She remained stable with good graft function and improved purpura and neuropathy for 2 years and 6 months, without signs of recurrence.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "RM is a 47-year-old woman who initially presented when she was 40 years old with 3 months of right knee pain in December 2010. At that time, a radiograph of the knee showed two lesions: a 3-cm circumscribed lytic lesion of the posterolateral distal femur thought possibly to be a nonossifying fibroma, as well as a 2-cm circumscribed lytic lesion with sclerotic margins involving the proximal tibial epiphysis. An MRI 1 month later showed lesions suspicious for TGCT; an orthopedic oncologist recommended a diagnostic arthroscopy with possible conversion to open anterior and posterior synovectomy. The patient declined and underwent a trial of oral prednisone with some symptomatic relief until October 2012 when she re-presented with worsening pain, edema, and a limp. At that time, she underwent biopsy, which was read as a likely inflammatory process. One week later the patient underwent an incisional biopsy.\nHistology of the neoplasm showed a hypercellular lesion consistent with D-TGCT. Immunohistochemistry revealed negative pankeratins, negative desmin, negative CD1a, positive CD68 in a patchy distribution, and a Ki-67 of 10%. A repeat MRI at the time of diagnosis showed a marked increase in the size of the synovial soft mass extending into the suprapatellar compartment, as well as anterior and posterior infrapatellar compartments. The suprapatellar aspect measured 20 cm \u00d7 9.9 cm \u00d7 13 cm (CC \u00d7 AP \u00d7 TV). A PET-CT scan indicated no metastatic disease and an SUVmax of 21.7 in the lesions (Fig. ). Considering the extent of disease, nonsurgical management was indicated as surgical resection would likely result in significant morbidity. In February 2013, 1 week after the PET-CT, the patient consented to oral therapy with pexidartinib (PLX3397) at 600 mg qAM and 400 mg qHS for a cumulative 1000-mg daily dose. At this time, the patient had an ECOG of 1, was on disability and could no longer work as a nurse given her requirement for a walker, and was managing her pain with naproxen, morphine, and acetaminophen\u2013hydrocodone.\nAt the 2-week follow-up, the patient reported an improvement of pain and an increased range of motion. Three weeks after initiation, a repeat PET-CT showed disease response with an SUVmax of 6.3. By 1 month after initiation, the patient reported she was transitioning to crutches and using fewer opioids. By the 4-month MRI, there was a reduction in her tumor burden by 48% via RECIST 1.1 (14.3 \u00d7 7.0 \u00d7 12.6 cm to 8.1 \u00d7 1.7 \u00d7 6.0 cm, 5.6 \u00d7 2.9 \u00d7 8.3 cm to 1.8 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 3.5 cm, and 9.0 \u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 9.1 cm to 5.0 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 3.5 cm CC \u00d7 AP \u00d7 TV). At this time, her ECOG was changed to 0 as she was ambulating without assistance and returned to work; she had also reduced her pain medications to occasional naproxen and had weaned herself off opioids. During the course of treatment, the dose was adjusted to 400 mg qAM and qHS for 2 months and then to 400 mg qAM and 600 mg qHS, in an effort to manage nausea. Other side effects included fatigue, dysgeusia, and peri-orbital edema. After 55 months of therapy, the patient had stable disease following the initial response with no progression at any time during the treatment course. The most recent MRI imaging on 9/8/2017 showed only two aspects of the lesion, measuring 0.4 \u00d7 4.9 cm (AP \u00d7 TV with inability to visualize CC view) and 1.2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 2.9 cm (CC \u00d7 AP \u00d7 TV).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

The ppo VC and ppo FEV1 were 2.68 L and 2.22 L, respectively. The preoperative computed tomography scan revealed that the tumour had invaded the anterior mediastinal fat tissue and phrenic nerve (Fig. , ).\nThe patient was placed in a lateral position on the operating table under general anaesthesia with selective lung ventilation. Two thoracoport trocars (15 mm) were placed in the sixth intercostal space (ICS) at the anterior axillary line and in the seventh ICS at the posterior axillary line. An anterolateral mini-thoracotomy (35 mm) was performed in the fourth ICS for left upper lobectomy (Fig. ). We resected the phrenic nerve and pericardial fat with an optimal surgical margin and then performed left upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection. Thoracoscopic diaphragmatic plication was performed with 3\u20130 Prolene sutures running from the dorsolateral to ventromedial diaphragm in order to oversew the diaphragmatic tendon pars and imbricate the muscle part (Fig. ). Dacron pledgets were only used for the first suture and the suture was retracted to the cranial side during needle stitch (Fig. ). The thoracoscope was placed through the thoracoport trocar in the seventh ICS at the posterior axillary line and the plication was performed through the thoracoport trocar in the sixth ICS at the anterior axillary line with an endoscopic needle holder.\nThe pathological diagnosis was a T3N2M0 primary adenosquamous carcinoma invading the phrenic nerve with negative surgical margins. The patient\u2019s postoperative course was favourable without any complications. No clinical symptoms were observed during the follow-up. Pulmonary function testing performed 1 year after the surgery revealed VC and FEV1 values of 2.36 L and 2.08 L, respectively.

However, the routine postsurgical abdominal X-ray test showed a cord-like material in the lower right abdomen that was not captured in the preoperative X-ray test performed two months before the operation (). We therefore decided to investigate this finding by relaparoscopy.\nDuring relaparoscopy, we could not find any retained material, and we performed the X-ray test again using a laparoscopic forceps as a mark (). The cord-like material was still captured, with a minor posture change. The shape and position were found to overlap with the appendix (), leading us to conclude that the material captured in the X-ray tests was likely retained barium in the appendix.

{"clinical_note": "A 30-year-old female was referred to the urology clinic for severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in addition to suspicion of a urethral mass. Her symptoms started two years earlier after the indwelling urethral catheter was removed following her Caesarian section. She noticed that a vestibular mass protruded at the level of her urethra and she reported increasing need to strain to void. In addition, this vestibular mass was very painful, and it required manual reduction to allow for her to void. LUTS got progressively worse over the course of the two years. In addition to the dysuria, she had intermittent hematuria, frequency of every hour as well as nocturia 3 to 4 times per night. Her personal past medical history was only positive for a remote appendectomy and a caesarean section. The patient had been previously worked up by her obstetrician since the LUTS appeared after her caesarean delivery. She had repeated urine analyses and cultures that were negative. Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated the presence of two cystic lesions in the bladder of 2.5cm and 9mm in diameter. The kidneys did not show any hydronephrosis nor hydroureter. Her blood work, including renal function, was unremarkable.\nExamination in lithotomy position revealed a very sensitive erythematous mucosa protruding from the urethra. Patient had to manually reduce the vestibular mass in the sitting position so that she could undergo cystoscopic examination under local anesthesia. Otherwise, it was too painful for the patient. Once reduced, cystoscopy was performed and demonstrated the presence of two large ureteroceles. The left ureterocele, which was significantly larger than the right side, demonstrated erythematous and edematous mucosa indicating that the vestibular mass previously noted by the patient and on examination was likely the wall of the left ureterocele. To rule out duplex system, a triphasic CT-urogram was ordered and it confirmed the patient's bilateral single-system ureteroceles (Figures \u2013). No urolithiasis was identified in both collecting systems. She was offered transurethral \u201cunroofing\u201d of her ureteroceles with placement of bilateral indwelling ureteral stents to reduce risk of ureteral obstruction postoperatively (). While the patient was waiting for her elective surgery, she presented to the emergency department in acute urinary retention in addition to significant lower abdominal pain. An indwelling urethral catheter was placed to reduce the prolapsed ureterocele, decompress the bladder, and control her severe pain. Subsequently, she underwent the planned endoscopic procedure. We started with the larger and more symptomatic left ureterocele. As soon as we unroofed the ureterocele, we identified the normal ureteral orifice and placed ureteral catheter over a guidewire (). Ureteral catheters were used to avoid injuring the back wall of the ureterocele and avoid injuring the true ureteral orifice within the ureterocele. The same procedure was repeated for the smaller right ureterocele. Once the anterior wall of the ureterocele was resected, we placed indwelling ureteral stents bilaterally. Final pathology demonstrated benign urothelium with cystitis cystica and glandularis in addition to Von Brunn's nests. Indwelling ureteral stents were removed shortly after her operation. At 3-month follow-up, the patient was completely asymptomatic with normal voiding patterns, a normal flow study and renal function. Repeat CT-urogram demonstrated resolution of her bilateral ureteroceles without any signs of ureteral stricture, nor hydronephrosis (Figures \u2013).

Initial difficulty in ambulating and using the stairs progressed to being wheelchair bound. Neurologic exam revealed diffuse 3/5 left sided weakness, left leg drift, and left facial droop. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large confluent white matter T2-hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe with multifocal nodular enhancement of the left cerebral hemisphere (). Foci of enhancement were also identified in the cerebellum and leptomeninges. The radiologic differential diagnosis included vasculitis, lymphoma, and CNS sarcoidosis as the most probable causes of the multifocal disease process, with glial neoplasm, demyelination, and metastases considered less likely.\nAll sample analysis described below were performed on material obtained by brain biopsy as part of clinical care. All samples were obtained with appropriate consent.\nA biopsy of the mass was performed and revealed extensive parenchymal lakes and vascular and perivascular deposition of amorphous, amyloid like material (). Congo-red positive staining and apple-green birefringence (not shown) of the amorphous material upon polarization confirmed that the amorphous material was amyloid (). Also present in the resected tissue were a number of small intraparenchymal blood vessels with perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates (). The initial histologic differential diagnoses included cerebral amyloid angiopathy-inflammatory type (CAA-I) and lymphoma associated amyloidoma. To identify the underlying etiology of the amyloid accumulation, a number of additional analyses were performed.\nLiquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopic analysis identified the amyloid as AL \u03bb-type and not \u03b2 amyloid or an amyloid associated with a hereditary amyloidosis. Further analysis of the perivascular lymphoid populations was undertaken. Histologically, the monotonous populations of perivascular lymphoid cells demonstrated a lymphoplasmacytic appearance (). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the lymphoid cells were CD20 positive (). Tumor cells were negative for CD3, CD5, BCL1, and CD23. The tumor Ki67 proliferation index was low (3%). The more plasmacytoid appearing cells were CD138 positive and were shown to be lambda light chain restricted by kappa and lambda chromogenic in situ analysis (Figures and ). An immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement analysis of the brain tissue from this case was positive for a clonal process with a 253-base pair peak in the FR2 region. A MYD88 L265P mutation analysis by PCR-based pyrosequencing on the brain tissue from this case was negative. A diagnosis of a low grade, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) was rendered. The identification of this CNS low grade lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma confirmed the cause of the amyloidoma to be a lambda light chain producing lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.\nTo determine if an extracranial/systemic lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma was the source of the CNS neoplasm, a bone marrow biopsy was performed. The bone marrow biopsy showed normal trilineage hematopoiesis and no evidence of lymphoma, myeloma, or amyloidosis. Cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization studies on the bone marrow were negative for genetic aberrations. Urine protein and serum immunoglobulin levels were within normal limits. A biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue was negative for amyloid, demonstrating lack of evidence of systemic amyloid deposition. Interestingly, an IgH gene rearrangement analysis on the bone marrow was positive for a clonal gene rearrangement with two peaks: a 282-base pair peak in FR2 region and a 120-base pair peak in FR3 region in a polyclonal background, which importantly were markedly different from the IgH gene rearrangement identified in the CNS lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Since the two-small bone marrow clonal peaks are present in a polyclonal background, their significance is uncertain and may be age related.\nOur patient received one cycle of chemotherapy with Rituximab for Primary CNS lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.

She received symptomatic treatment and, once stabilized, was discharged home. However, over the next three days, she developed oral sores and jaw tightness, which prompted her to seek medical attention again. Her physical examination revealed normal vital signs, mild dehydration, trismus, and white ulcers on the visible portion of the tongue that were suspicious for oral candidiasis. Laboratory data revealed mild leukocytosis (WBC 11.33 \u00d7 10\u00b3) and moderate hyponatremia (123 mmol/L) thought to be secondary to volume depletion and low solute intake. A CT scan of the head and neck was unremarkable. The temporomandibular joints were intact.

She was discharged after two days with a plan to follow up as an outpatient. However, she returned two days later with worsening jaw tightness and inability to swallow, for which she was readmitted.\nHer past medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and a history of deep venous thrombosis. Prior to admission, medications included glipizide, atorvastatin, telmisartan, and rivaroxaban. She was a lifetime nonsmoker and denied alcohol use. She denied recent trauma or skin lacerations, and reported having completed her primary immunization series against tetanus as a child. Her most recent tetanus booster was in 1965.\nOn physical exam, blood pressure was 147/82, pulse was 75, respiratory rate was 16, and temperature was 97.9\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C). She was euvolemic and in no apparent distress. The presence of trismus was evident\u2014the patient was unable to open her mouth beyond 2 mm. Laboratory data were remarkable for hyponatremia (122 mmol/L), and the patient was placed on normal saline.\nThe following day, the patient developed three brief episodes of tonic-clonic seizures in the setting of hyponatremia (127 mmol/L) and was treated with intravenous (IV) lorazepam, IV levetiracetam, and 3% saline infusion. An urgent computed tomography (CT) did not reveal any acute intracranial process. The seizures resolved, and the sodium level normalized, but the patient persisted with trismus and dysphagia. As part of the workup, she underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and temporomandibular joints, as well as a laryngoscopy and triple-phase bone scan, all of which were noncontributory. She was then given an atypical antipsychotic and antidepressant for a presumptive diagnosis of depression with somatization symptoms. A lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed 22 nucleated cells (90% lymphocytes), a protein level of 56 mg/dL, and a glucose level of 84 mg/dL. There was no bacterial growth. On the 14th day of illness, the patient developed right lid ptosis and ophthalmoparesis with a right gaze preference, which led to a working diagnosis of cephalic tetanus. She was given intramuscular (IM) tetanus immune globulin, IV metronidazole, and a booster dose of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid vaccine. Baclofen and lorazepam were used for spasm control. Pre-existing anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies were quantified below 0.05 IU/mL.\nUnfortunately, despite treatment, she developed episodes of agonal breathing, psychomotor agitation, and autonomic dysregulation characterized by bradycardia-tachycardia with labile blood pressure, which indicated possible progression to generalized tetanus. She had a cardiopulmonary arrest followed by myoclonus status epilepticus complicated with aspiration pneumonia and sepsis, which ultimately led to her death after 24 days of hospitalization.\nPostmortem exam of the brain showed moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic changes. The cerebrum and basal ganglia exhibited vascular congestion, cytoplasmic eosinophilia, and nuclear pyknosis of neuronal cells. Extensive neuronal loss was observed in the hippocampus and cerebellum.

{"clinical_note": "A 61-year-old male patient presented to the emergency room (ER) on account of a 3-month history of hemoptysis as well as a 2-week history of right upper extremity weakness and numbness.\nHemoptysis was associated with pleuritic right-sided chest pain as well as orthopnea and had been previously treated with two courses of empiric antibiotics and steroids at an outside hospital without improvement prompting his presentation to our emergency room.\nWeakness and numbness of the right upper extremity were initially associated with a painful right palmar rash which was resolved with self-administered topical corticosteroids at home.\nPast medical history was significant for untreated latent tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed about forty years prior to this presentation as well as coronary artery disease requiring stent placement twice in the past.\nOn presentation, the patient was not in acute distress but was tachycardic at 100 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of 16 cycles per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100 percent on room air. Blood pressure was 144/87 millimeters of mercury, and temperature was 99 degrees Fahrenheit.\nOn physical examination, he was afebrile and had normal breath sounds and heart sounds without murmurs. Neurological examination was notable for reduced sensation to light but not crude touch over the right hand with reduced strength of 4/5 in that in same extremity. Laboratory studies were significant for a white blood cell count of 18,400 per microliter with 76.3 percent neutrophils, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 90 millimeters per hour, and a C-reactive protein level of 167 milligrams per liter.\nImaging done on admission revealed multifocal lung opacities () concerning for community-acquired multifocal pneumonia (possibly secondary to a resistant organism as patient had completed courses of cefdinir and levofloxacin at the outside hospital without resolution of his symptoms). Other considerations were for possible septic emboli of undetermined source as well as reactivated pulmonary tuberculosis given his long-standing history of latent TB with multiple positive skin purified protein derivative tests in the past.\nCT scan of the head without contrast was concerning for a possible infarct of unclear age, and a follow-up MRI revealed possible abscess collection (Figures and ).\nHe was initially placed on airborne isolation with empiric first-line antituberculosis agents (which were discontinued after 6 negative acid-fast bacilli sputum samples were obtained) as well as empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) for possible multifocal pneumonia, based on recommendations of the infectious disease consultants. Two blood cultures, obtained on admission, returned positive and grew Streptococcus intermedius sensitive to ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function and normal valves without regurgitations, stenosis or, vegetations.\nA subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed an 8.3 \u00d7 4.6 mm oscillating dumbbell-shaped vegetation arising from the Chiari network, close to the os of the right atrial appendage (), without evidence of valvular vegetations, insufficiency, or a patent foramen ovale.\nA diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made based on the modified Duke criteria with two separate blood cultures positive for Streptococcus intermedius, echocardiographic findings of an oscillating intracardiac mass, consistent with a vegetation, and septic pulmonary and intracranial lesions []. Medical management was chosen at the time of the diagnosis of this Chiari network endocarditis with septic emboli to the lungs and brain, with plans for repeat imaging with a transesophageal echo after six weeks of appropriate antibiotic therapy.\nAntibiotic coverage was thus narrowed and tailored to the culprit organism with ceftriaxone, and gentamycin was added for endocarditis synergy per infectious disease team recommendations. Clinical and laboratory evidences of improvement including resolution of the hemoptysis and right upper extremity weakness as well as reduction in the white blood cell count from 18,400 per microliter on admission to 6400 per microliter and in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate from 90 millimeters per hour to 28 millimeters per hour as well as the C reactive protein from 167 milligrams per liter to 0.9 milligrams per liter were documented.\nInterval reduction in the size of the lung lesions but not the brain lesions was noted after four weeks of parenteral antibiotic treatment, and neurosurgical evaluation for possible evacuation of the abscess was thus recommended. The patient was transferred to an outside hospital where those services were readily available. He had an image-guided stereotactic drainage of the abscess via a left parietal burr hole, with initial gram stain of the fluid showing gram-positive cocci, but the culture had no growth after 5 days probably because the patient had been on appropriate antibiotics for four weeks prior to the drainage procedure.\nThe patient completed six weeks of antibiotic therapy at the outside hospital and was discharged home in a stable clinical state but did not follow up as recommended.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "Our patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian male referred initially to the pulmonary clinic for an abnormal high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest () showing ground glass opacities (GGOs), thickening of the interlobular septa primarily in the bases with minimal honeycombing, mediastinal adenopathies, and small bilateral pleural effusions. He had complaints of progressive shortness of breath and an unproductive cough. Medical history was relevant for 31-pack-year smoking history, asbestos exposure, uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus type II, and obesity. His oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed bibasilar crackles with poor air entry but no clubbing or cyanosis. Pulmonary function test demonstrated an obstructive lung disease with mildly decreased forced vital capacity (FVC) at 76% and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at 70%, borderline FEV1/FVC ratio at 72%, and excellent effort. Lung volumes also revealed a restrictive lung disease with moderately decreased total lung capacity (TLC) at 64%. Finally, the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLco) was severely reduced at 44%.\nThe initial outpatient workup included a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), urinalysis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), creatine kinase (CK), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide immunoglobulin G (Anti-CCP), histoplasmosis antibodies, human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27), aspergillus galactomannan antigen, interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis, anti-SCL-70 antibody, beta D-glucan, and antinuclear antibodies (ANA). All were negative except a borderline nonspecific elevation in ACE, LDH, and CK levels and positive ANCA antibodies.\nTo address the interstitial lung disease pattern, a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lung biopsy was performed. Right lower and right upper lobe wedge excisions revealed classic desquamative interstitial pneumonia, along with foci of respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial pneumonia, mild interstitial fibrosis, and emphysematous changes (Figures and ).\nThe patient's history of lifelong smoking along with asbestos exposure [] likely contributed to these histological changes and DIP diagnosis.\nTo treat DIP, he was started on a tapered dose of glucocorticoids (starting at 40 mg of prednisone) along with nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation. Over a 7-month treatment course, the prednisone dose was lowered to 10mg with improvement in his dyspnea and cough. With assistance from the nicotine replacement, the patient successfully quit smoking for 6 months. Repeat CT images showed improvement in GGOs and resolution of prior small pleural effusions.\nAfter 7 months of DIP treatment and with minimal respiratory symptoms, he restarted smoking one pack of cigarettes a day. Six weeks after restarting smoking, respiratory issues quickly developed, and he required hospitalization for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Upon admission the patient was tachypneic with labored breathing, worsening bibasilar crackles, decreased air entry, and an unproductive cough. Given his presentation and dropping oxygen saturation to 84% on room air, he was given 100% FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) by nonrebreather mask.\nAfter discussing treatment options for respiratory failure, the patient refused intubation and mechanical ventilation with complete understanding that his condition could be life-threatening. His breathing was therefore supported with alternating 100% FiO2 by nonrebreather mask and noninvasive ventilator support to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.\nA chest X-ray () and a chest CT angiogram () were ordered. No pulmonary emboli were found. However, imaging did show significant worsening bilateral GGOs, bibasilar consolidations, mediastinal adenopathies, and a new moderate right pleural effusion. The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin. Laboratory workup was unremarkable for infection however. White blood cell count was slightly elevated at 12,600 without a left shift. Procalcitonin level was borderline at 0.14 ng/mL, C-reactive protein was elevated initially but then normalized, and the patient was afebrile at 98.4 Fahrenheit. NT-proBNP was normal which excluded congestive heart failure as a cause for the pleural effusion and GGOs. Repeated arterial blood gas measurements displayed no abnormalities in pH or carbon dioxide levels despite his labored breathing.\nAdditional negative tests included respiratory polymerase chain reaction viral panel, fungal serology, blood cultures, sputum acid-fast bacilli testing, urine streptococcus, and legionella. Sputum fungal and bacterial cultures grew Candida dubliniensis and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Although, these organisms are not generally considered pathogens in humans unless severely immunocompromised and have been found in normal oral flora [, ].\nTo further investigate a cause for the acute decompensation, the patient was offered a bronchoscopy and thoracentesis for mediastinal sampling and pleural effusion, respectively. After an extensive discussion, he refused all invasive diagnostic procedures.\nFour days passed after being given broad spectrum antibiotics and no improvement was observed. Repeat imaging showed a persistence of bilateral interstitial opacities and pleural effusion. His oxygen saturation level still required 100% FiO2 supplementation to maintain above 90%. Because initial workup for the acute respiratory failure was inconclusive, less common etiologies were considered including DIP exacerbation.\nOn the fourth hospitalization day, treatment for possible DIP exacerbation was initiated and antibiotics were stopped. He was given 40 mg methylprednisolone every 8 hours. Within hours, his shortness of breath and oxygen saturation drastically improved. All respiratory symptoms dissipated, and he was stable to be treated as an outpatient after 48 hours of starting treatment. His discharge plan included oxygen support by nasal cannula and oral prednisone. He agreed to a smoking cessation plan with nicotine patches.\nTen days after discharge, an office-visit chest X-ray () showed complete resolution of the pleural effusion and bilateral interstitial and airspace diseases markedly improved. His oxygen saturation climbed to 96% on room air indicating supplemental oxygen was no longer needed.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Physical exam demonstrated a mildly overweight man with normal blood pressure and minimal physical signs of acromegaly who appeared well virilized and exhibited normal testicular size. Serum IGF-I level by immunochemiluminometric assay (ICMA) was increased at 457 ng/mL (reference range 67-205 ng/mL), as well as serum prolactin 79 ng/ml (reference range 4.0\u201315.2 ng/ml) growth hormone (GH) level 1.9 ng/mL (reference range 0-10 ng/mL) which did not suppress 2 hours after a 75 gram oral glucose load measured at 1.8 ng/mL; while serum testosterone level was markedly decreased at 74 ng/dL (reference range 348-1197ng/dL), gonadotropin levels were normal (). MRI demonstrated a 9 x 9 mm mass lesion in the left inferior-posterior aspect of the sella turcica abutting the left carotid artery. The patient was treated initially with transsphenoidal surgery achieving a gross total resection. Histopathology revealed a pituitary adenoma staining strongly on immunohistochemistry for prolactin and weakly for GH.\nSix months after surgery, serum IGF-I level was persistently elevated at 285ng/mL; a random GH level was 0.4 ng/mL. Prolactin levels were no longer elevated and the remainder of the pituitary function tests was normal except for serum total testosterone which remained low at 255 ng/dl and low free testosterone measured by mass spectrometry at 6.0 pg/ml (reference range 6.8-21.5.pg/ml). MRI showed a partial empty sella with no evidence of tumor. The patient reported improvement of joint aches, snoring and swelling of hands yet complained of persistent fatigue and sexual dysfunction. After discussion of treatment options including somatostatin analogs, dopamine agonists, growth hormone receptor antagonist, and various forms of testosterone replacement, the patient preferred to attempt a trial of clomiphene citrate. The patient was started on oral clomiphene citrate (CC), 25 mg/day.\nSix months after clomiphene initiation, the patient reported resolution of fatigue and improved libido which correlated with an improvement on total testosterone levels 355 ng/dL and free testosterone level 8.6 pg/ml. 11 months after clomiphene therapy, laboratory evaluation reported normalization of both serum IGF-I (134 ng/ml) and a peak serum total testosterone (535ng/dl) and free testosterone (12.6 pg/ml), while GH 0.5 ng/ml and prolactin levels (5.5 ng/ml) remained controlled (). Free testosterone levels increased into the normal range with CC treatment, paralleling the increase of total testosterone levels (). After a brief trial of four months of discontinuing clomiphene treatment, total testosterone, free testosterone, and IGF-I levels returned to near pretreatment values and the patient had recurrence of hypogonadal symptoms.

He was sent to our clinic because of acute and severe hair loss which occurred for 10 days. According to his self-reported history, he was healthy in the past and did not take any medications. He also denied the possibility of accidental poisoning. Physical examination revealed diffuse alopecia of scalp (). His liver function was damaged (ALT 154.8u/l and AST 49.2 u/l), but the levels of urine mercury, hair arsenic, and blood lead were all normal. The scalp hair was completely lost () 1 week later.

{"clinical_note": "We report on a 55-year-old man who was diagnosed with CPPS by urology specialists from the university hospital and referred to us for pain treatment with local anesthetics (neural therapy).\nAt his first consultation with us, the patient reported pain and other ailments that began 35 years prior, after a party in a damp basement, without vanishing ever since. In the same night, pollakisuria and dysuria occurred, and the patient noted a permanently painful foreign body sensation in the areas of the prostate and anus, as well as perineally. Furthermore, he complained of a burning sensation in the urethra, a slightly reduced urinary stream, and nocturia of varying frequency. In addition to the ongoing chronic pain, the patient suffered from week- to month-long episodes of increased pain with no discernible trigger. Overall, the pain and other symptoms progressed over time.\nOver the years, various specialist urological examinations were carried out and several attempts at treatment with various empirical antibiotic therapies and analgesics were made. Also, nerve stimulation therapy was applied, and a probatory surgical removal of both seminal vesicles and an extension surgery on the anus were performed. None of these measures resulted in any improvement in pain or other symptoms. The patient was then referred to us by the urologists for a probatory pain treatment with LA.\nAt the first consultation with us the patient was in a particularly severe pain phase. He complained of permanent pain and discomfort perineally and in the areas of the prostate, anus, and urethra, associated with pollakisuria, dysuria, and nocturia (more than ten times per night). Due to this the quality of life was impaired to a large degree. The patient was desperate and did not believe that he could be helped anymore.\nFor nine years he was taking an analgesically effective antiepileptic drug, Gabapentin, as well as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac, the opioid Oxycodone, and the pain-modifying tricyclic antidepressant, Amitriptyline.\nThe National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) resulted in 39 points (pain: 18; urinary symptoms: 10; quality of life impact: 11). In rectal palpation, the patient felt pain in the lesser pelvis while the prostate was inconspicuous, as was the case in the recently performed sonography, in which 50 ml of residual urine had been detected. The PSA value was found to be 0.4 ng/ml.\nOur treatment consisted of suprapubic injection of 5 ml each of 1% procaine on the right and the left with infiltration of the vesicoprostatic plexus (in line with neural therapy). In this injection, the puncture site is directly behind the pectineal line (pecten ossis pubis), 5 cm laterally to the center of the symphysis. The puncture direction is 45\u00b0 both medially and caudally. The needle point needs always to remain extraperitoneal in the paravesical connective tissue, in which the vegetative nerve fibers are located. The penetration depth in the described patient was 7 cm, with the needle gauge being 23.5 (0.6 mm).\nJust a few minutes after the first injection, the pain decreased significantly and persistently to a level the patient had not experienced in years (in his own terms: 90% improvement of all symptoms). In the following days, the patient experienced a further and lasting significant reduction in pain and other symptoms. At the next consultation after two weeks NIH-CPSI resulted in 11 points (pain: 3; urinary symptoms: 4; quality of life impact: 4). To maintain and further increase the effect, we performed the suprapubic injection of procaine a total of six more times, initially once a month, and bimonthly later. With each injection, the pains continued to decrease, up to freedom from pain and discomfort. Relapses occurred less frequently, were significantly lower in intensity and the duration was significantly shorter with an average of three days. Even the symptom-free intervals were getting longer. The patient reduced Diclofenac and Oxycodone on his own initiative and completely discontinued both drugs after the fifth consultation. After seven treatments, he was also able to stop Gabapentin and Amitriptyline and remained free of discomfort (NIH-CPSI: 0 points), which also had a positive effect on his mental and social integrity.\nNo adverse effects were observed.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

{"clinical_note": "A 63-year-old female was admitted at our institution due to generalized body weakness and anorexia. She is a known hypertensive with chronic kidney disease. Upon further work-up, she was assessed to have severe hyponatremia (116 mmol/L), hypokalemia (2.8 mmol/L) and hypomagnesemia (1.2 mg/dL). Ionized calcium was 1.82 mmol/L (reference range: 1.00\u20131.30 mmol/L), serum PTH was 3071.90 pg/mL (reference range: 14.0\u201372.0 pg/mL), and serum vitamin D was 35.52 ng/mL (reference range: \u2265 30 ng/mL). Because of the clinical suspicion for primary hyperparathyroidism, a parathyroid scan was requested for further evaluation.\nParathyroid scintigraphy was performed using a dual-tracer protocol and with SPECT/CT as per institutional standard procedure. Planar imaging of the neck and thorax was done 15 minutes after intravenous injection of 173.9 MBq of 99mTc-pertechnetate. Planar and SPECT/CT images of the neck and thorax were acquired 15 minutes after injection of 769.6 MBq of 99mTc-sestamibi. Delayed 2- and 4-hour planar images were also obtained.\nStatic and subtraction images are illustrated in The 99mTc-pertechnetate image showed decreased tracer uptake in the inferior half of the right thyroid lobe but fairly homogeneous tracer uptake in the left lobe. The initial 99mTc-sestamibi planar image revealed a large focus of increased tracer activity in the inferior pole of the right lobe. The said focus showed retained activity on subtraction images and was found to arise from a solid mass with calcification on SPECT/CT (). Incidentally, a fainter focus of tracer uptake was noted in a soft tissue mass on the lateral aspect of the 7th right rib ().\nDelayed 2- and 4-hour planar images () showed tracer retention in the inferior pole of the right lobe. Symmetric tracer clearance was seen in the rest of the thyroid parenchyma. Physiologic tracer uptake was seen in the naso- and oropharynx, salivary glands, myocardium and liver dome.\nHistopathologic correlation was recommended for the sestamibi-avid mass with calcification in the inferior pole of the right thyroid lobe. This was attributed to a parathyroid carcinoma or adenoma, although a thyroid pathology was also possible. A similar recommendation was made for the incidental sestamibi-avid soft tissue mass in the lateral aspect of the 7th right rib, as it was highly suspicious for metastasis.\nThe patient was subsequently given intravenous furosemide for calcium correction. Intravenous saline solution was titrated for sodium correction. Intravenous potassium chloride, then later oral potassium citrate, was given for potassium correction. Magnesium sulfate infusion was given to correct for magnesium. After 10 days of admission, the patient was deemed to have acceptable electrolyte levels (ionized calcium 1.39 mmol/L; sodium 136.9 mmol/L; potassium 4.4 mmol/L; magnesium 2.2 mg/dL) and no subjective complaints. She was thus discharged and started on Cinacalcet, a calcimimetic drug, to address the patient\u2019s hyperparathyroid state.\nShe underwent total thyroidectomy in another institution two months post-discharge. The final histopathologic diagnosis was as follows:\nFavor a parathyroid carcinoma, right lobe. Lymphovascular space invasion seen. Negative for tumor: surgical resection margins. Recommend immunohistochemical staining.\nPapillary microcarcinoma (0.2 cm greatest diameter), limited to the left lobe. Negative for extrathyroidal extension.\nMultinodular colloid goiter with hyperplastic features, isthmus and pyramidal lobe.\nHistopathologic slide review was done in our institution 7 months later. The final assessment showed an enlarged hypercellular parathyroid consistent with parathyroid carcinoma. The pathologist remarked that while the lesion is not mitotically active nor is there the presence of more recognizable definitive criteria for malignancy such as vascular and perineural invasion in the submitted material, the lesion shows extension beyond the capsule and encroaching on sizable extraglandular vessels.\nImmunohistochemical staining was also performed on slide review and was said to substantiate the above findings. The specimen was positive for chromogranin and negative for synaptophysin, thyroglobulin and calcitonin. Ki-67 was found to be less than 5% (low index of proliferation).\nThe patient was lost to follow-up after surgery. Seven months later, she was re-admitted at our institution due to alleged behavioral changes. Serum sodium, potassium and calcium were within normal limits. Repeat PTH was noted to be 438.70 pg/mL. Once she was stabilized, she was referred to the Medical Oncology service for possible chemotherapy initiation. A bone scan was subsequently requested for metastatic work-up.\nWhole body bone scintigraphy in the anterior and posterior projections, with additional views of the head, thorax and pelvis, was performed 2.5 hours after intravenous injection of 1054.5 MBq of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (MDP).

Her physical examination showed spontaneous upbeat nystagmus (Video ), gait instability, and ataxia with a tendency to lean to the left side while walking.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, as shown in Figure , revealed symmetrical T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense signals on bilateral medial thalamic regions, more pronounced on the left along with a diffusion restriction in the same regions. Figure shows an axial view of the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence, which revealed cytotoxic edema in regions of the bilateral thalamus with corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) changes.\nShe also underwent a magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) that did not show venous sinus thrombosis. Blood was drawn for thiamine levels before the replacement, which showed a low thiamine level of 40 nmol/L (normal range: 70-180 nmol/L). She was treated with high dose IV thiamine 400 mg for three days followed by 100 mg per day. At the time of discharge, her memory and gait instability improved significantly. However, the patient had persistent upbeating nystagmus. She was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation with daily oral thiamine replacement. The patient was re-evaluated from three months of diagnosis in our outpatient clinic and was noted to have a persistent upbeating nystagmus (Video ). She no longer had any major deficits in memory and/or gait.\nWe also obtained a repeat MRI of the brain during this follow-up that showed a significant resolution of previously identified bilateral hyperintense signals in bilateral medial thalamic regions on T2/FLAIR sequence (Figure ). As shown in Video , at six months follow-up, her spontaneous vertical nystagmus had resolved, but she continued to have gaze-evoked horizontal and vertical nystagmus.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "The patient is a 36-year-old African American male who initially presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of feeling confused for the past day. He also complained of depression, anxiety, and paranoia. The patient declined psychiatric evaluation and medical admission at that time and was discharged home. The patient was urged to come back to the hospital by his wife and mother approximately 14 hours later due to disorientation, confusion, and agitation. At that time, he was admitted for an altered mental status workup with the working diagnosis of medication-induced delirium. Psychiatry was consulted to the medical floor and one-to-one observation was recommended. The patient underwent a full neurologic workup, including a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and a lumbar puncture, which were unremarkable. The patient elected to leave against medical advice after two days. He presented to the emergency department two days later with similar complaints. At that time, all labs, including urinalysis, complete metabolic panel, urine drug screen, complete blood count, and vital signs, were within normal limits, and he was medically cleared and evaluated by psychiatry in the emergency department.\nDuring this evaluation, the patient was calm and cooperative. He reported being diagnosed with a \u201ctesticular infection\u201d and was prescribed a course of ciprofloxacin, 500 mg for 10 days. He reported that he was not thinking clearly after starting the antibiotic and stated that he had \u201csome side effects\u201d but was too paranoid to elaborate. The medication was discontinued during his previous admission. He was unable to provide any details regarding the reason for admission and stated that it was his wife\u2019s idea to come to the hospital. The patient appeared internally preoccupied, guarded, and paranoid throughout the evaluation process. He denied any auditory or visual hallucinations. The patient once again requested to sign out of the hospital against medical advice. The patient was paranoid about what the medical staff was doing with his blood and stated he did not feel safe in the hospital. Collateral information was obtained from the patient\u2019s wife who reported that the patient's behavior changed abruptly after starting the ciprofloxacin. She reported that the patient was very paranoid and accused her of attempting to poison him.\nThe patient had no previous psychiatric history. The patient reported marijuana use since age 17. He recently stopped using marijuana two weeks prior to treatment for the diagnosis of epididymitis; he had used approximately one gram every other day prior to stopping. Social history revealed the patient is married with three children and employed as a construction worker. The patient denied any previous medical or surgical history.\nThe differential diagnosis included medication-induced delirium, drug-induced psychosis, cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, and brief psychotic disorder. The patient was admitted to the psychiatric inpatient unit.

Specifically, after the meticulous dissection of the thorax region and the mediastinum, and after the excision of both lungs and the heart by means of the classical method of anatomical dissection, we detected an enlarged left-sided AV with maximum diameter 11.05 mm approximately at its midportion. The specific cadaver displayed hemiazygos and accessory hemiazygos veins in the expected course in the mediastinum, whereas the thoracic duct was noted ascending normally through the posterior mediastinum between the azygos vein and the thoracic aorta. In particular, at the level of tenth, ninth, and eighth thoracic vertebra the AV lay on the left side of the spine and the distance between the vessel and the midline of the vertebral column was 3.91 mm at the tenth, 5.75 mm at the ninth and 2.69 mm at the eighth thoracic vertebra. From the twelfth to tenth thoracic vertebra the AV lay on the midline of the spine, whilst from the seventh thoracic vertebra to its end in the superior vena cava, the AV was found as expected at the right side of the vertebral column. Our finding was documented by several photographs taken using a Nikon D3400 digital camera, and the measurements were made using a digital vernier caliper with an accuracy of 0.01 mm.

Final pathology showed pT3 N0 M0, stage III disease. He remained disease free until April 2016, at which point he developed new exertional dyspnea and a small lung nodule was noted on imaging. During cardiac clearance for a biopsy, a Mobitz 2 heart block with bradycardia was noted. Transthoracic echocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated a mass in the right ventricular outflow tract, which was additionally found to be fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid on positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) (Figure , upper panel).\nThe patient developed progressive dyspnea with minimal exertion and then experienced a syncopal episode prompting hospitalization. Biopsy of the right ventricular mass demonstrated poorly differentiated carcinoma, consistent with urothelial origin (Figure ).\nThe mass was not felt to be respectable and chemotherapy was not felt to offer rapid disease control in the setting of progressive symptoms. He was offered palliative radiotherapy. His bradycardia progressed to a complete heart block, likely due to the growth of the mass, necessitating placement of a dual chamber pacemaker. The right ventricle mass was treated with 45 Gy in 18 fractions (3D conformal photons for 5 fractions, followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the remaining 13 fractions (to reduce dose to the left ventricle). Figure demonstrates the dose distribution.\nProton radiation was considered to spare the uninvolved myocardium. He had substantial tumor thromboembolic disease to his lungs during radiotherapy, requiring medical intensive care unit (MICU) admission for symptom management. He ultimately completed the full course of radiotherapy which improved his functional status.\nFollowing radiotherapy, he began immune checkpoint therapy with the PD-L1 antagonist atezolizumab (1200 mg every three weeks), which was well tolerated. A PET/CT scan seven months after completing radiation demonstrated a complete metabolic response in the right ventricle mass and no other sites of progression (Figure , lower panel). The previously noted pulmonary nodules were stable. He resumed normal activity and returned to work. Eight months after radiotherapy and six months into his immune therapy, he developed progressive shortness of breath. He had heart failure and the ejection fraction reduced to 20%-30%. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a focal area of subendocardial delayed enhancement, potentially representing myocarditis. Cardiac catheterization revealed extensive coronary artery disease and complete occlusion of the right coronary artery; however, the left to right collaterals were intact. Atezolizumab was held with an initiation of high dose steroids to treat potential immune-mediated myocarditis with minimal effect. Electrophysiology testing demonstrated severe cardiac dyssynchrony. Cardiac resynchronization therapy was recommended and a biventricular pacer was placed with rapid symptom relief. He returned to work with overall minimal symptoms. Atezolizumab was resumed, and a total of 18 cycles (54 weeks) of therapy were completed without issue.\nIn the months that followed the placement of his biventricular pacer, he was evaluated several times for shortness of breath and atypical chest pain, however with no clear etiology. PET/CT imaging in August 2017 demonstrated increased FDG-avidity in his right ventricle concerning for progression. An MRI was ordered and in early September 2017, he was admitted for workup of an exacerbation of chest pain. A contrast-enhanced CT of the chest showed significant disease progression in the area of prior treatment, extension toward the left ventricle and along the heart wall leading to increased right heart pressure (Figure ), and probable encasement of his left anterior descending (LAD) artery by disease progression (Figure ). He had acute progression of chest pain associated with an increased oxygen requirement, shortly after being admitted.

He was believed to have unspecified schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or schizotypal personality disorder. He was started on risperidone 0.5 mg BID and was increased to 2 mg BID. Trazodone was initiated for sleep and lithium 300 mg BID for mood stabilization was added throughout the course. His condition improved and he was discharged.\nApproximately 16 months later, he was brought in by emergency petition because he was trying to enter a stranger\u2019s car. He mistook the stranger\u2019s car for his own. Upon admission, the patient was unable to provide an accurate history due to confusion and memory impairment.

During this hospital stay, confusion and psychomotor retardation were noted. In response, his risperidone dose was decreased with no change in psychotic symptoms; however, he began developing extrapyramidal side effects. He displayed involuntary movements of the mouth, flailing movements, restlessness, and a patting of his head. Risperidone was replaced by zyprexa due to the decreased likelihood of extrapyramidal symptoms.

Her history was significant for chronic degenerative joint disease of shoulder and hip joints. She denied prior autoimmune disorders including rheumatologic or inflammatory myopathies. Physical exam was unremarkable and preliminary workup was negative. Myocardial infarction was ruled out and she was discharged home after intra-articular steroid injection. Over the next two weeks, she developed fatigue, malaise and progressive proximal muscle weakness. She reported a 5-pound weight loss over one-week and had mild dyspnea both at rest and exertion but no functional limitations. She denied cough, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea. She noticed upper eyelid edema and a periorbital violaceous rash, prompting her to visit a walk-in clinic. She lived in rural WI but reported no tick bites or prior LD. She had no neurological complaints and there was no evidence of EM. She was discharged with oral prednisone 20 mg daily. After few days, she returned to the ED with persistent complaints despite steroid treatment. Vitals were stable upon arrival, but she appeared lethargic. There were no signs of distress and oxygen saturation was normal on room air. The physical exam showed a positive heliotrope rash and a positive malar rash involving both nasolabial folds. She had a macular erythematous rash of extensor surface of forearms. Moreover, a widely distributed erythema of the upper neck, extending to the upper back and upper shoulders indicating a \u201cShawl sign\u201d was noted. A generalized cutaneous erythema with edema involving the abdominal wall was also present. The musculoskeletal exam revealed symmetric pelvic and shoulder girdle weakness; examination of shoulder joints was unremarkable. Nervous system exam was negative for focal neurological deficits. Labs showed leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein (Table ).\nAlanine aminotransferase was elevated; creatine kinase was normal. Antibodies including anti-cyclic citrulline peptide antibody, antimitochondrial antibody and anticardiolipin IgA and IgM were positive; anti-JO-1 antibody was negative. Chest radiograph showed no lung pathology. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed interstitial lung disease but no malignancy. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with few premature atrial complexes. The patient\u2019s clinical presentation mimicked DM. Moreover, there was a suspicion of LD due to its increased prevalence in WI. Therefore, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was ordered, and the patient was started on IV ceftriaxone as empiric treatment. After receiving empiric antibiotic, the patient appeared toxic, became hypotensive and developed high-grade fever. However, the worsening of cutaneous lesions was not observed. Given clinical deterioration, blood cultures were drawn, and she received fluid resuscitation. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. While in ICU, two target-shaped lesions were noted on her left scapula, highly suggestive of LD-related EM; they were not previously reported or observed. The suspicion of LD became paramount leading to the addition of IV doxycycline given the patient\u2019s deteriorating condition. After few doses of antibiotics, the patient started showing signs of clinical improvement; fever and hypotension resolved. She required no further antibiotic adjustments given her prompt response to antiborrelial treatment. She had positive ELISA for LD, later confirmed with western blot (WB). Blood cultures showed no growth. She received a total of five days treatment with IV ceftriaxone and IV doxycycline. Her DM-like presentation showed an effective response to antimicrobial treatment, and therefore, required no steroids or immunosuppressants. Her skin lesions were resolved, and muscle strength was significantly improved. Given her recovery with antiborrelial treatment, DM workup including EMG, skin biopsy (SB) or muscle biopsy (MB), was not performed. DM-like features were attributed to the LD.

{"clinical_note": "A 32-year-old female patient initially presented at the age of 16 with high fever and severe abdominal pain associated with anorexia, but not diarrhea and vomiting. Over the period of the next 4 years, she had multiple hospital admission with similar presentation, which was always accompanied with raised C-reactive protein (CRP). On few occasions her urine dipstick showed traces of protein, and consequently she was treated for presumed urinary sepsis. However, multiple blood and urinary cultures were negative, other investigations including abdominal ultrasound showed no obvious intraabdominal pathology, and the diagnosis remained inconclusive. At the age of 21, she developed sudden onset polyarthritis, fever, and wide spread erythematous skin rash. The routine investigations at the time showed highly elevated acute phase response with CRP > 200 mg/L and hyperferritinemia. Additional investigations including antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) were all negative. Diagnosis of AOSD was at that point established, based on the typical clinical features associated with hyperferritinemia and exclusion other autoimmune rheumatological diagnoses. Her condition improved following initial treatment with oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 40 mg daily), but she remained dependant on prednisolone for the disease control despite attempts to introduce disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, and methotrexate, which were all largely ineffective. Over the next several years, she continued to suffer from inflammatory polyarthritis affecting predominantly the large joints (hips and knees). Prior to establishing her genetic diagnosis, the patient was eventually treated with tocilizumab to which she made an excellent response. She discontinued long-term corticosteroid treatment and remains well controlled on monotherapy with tocilizumab (IV 8 mg/kg monthly) for the last 2 years.\nSubsequent enquiries into her family history revealed that she has two children, a boy aged 6 and a half and a girl of age 4 years. Both children had history of unexplained inflammatory symptoms. The girl was symptomatic from the age of 8 months, at which point she begun having recurrent episodes of feeling generally unwell, with malaise and high fever up to 40\u00b0C. The frequency of these episodes varied between 2 and 4 weeks, and each episode was relatively short-lived, lasting anywhere between 2 and 3 days. On few occasions, the episodes of fever were associated with erythematous macular rash and mouth ulcers. Subsequently, she also developed episodic abdominal pain as well as difficulty walking due to the pain in her knees. All these symptoms would disappear when the fevers resolved and she would fully recover in between these episodes. Since commencing regular colchicine, she has not had any further inflammatory episodes or symptoms. Her brother was well until age 5 when, like his sister he started with monthly episodes of high fever lasting between several hours to several days. On few occasions, these episodes were associated with vomiting, mouth ulcers, and interestingly, salmon-pink skin rash. He was also commenced on colchicine, which in his case has not been as effective, and he is currently awaiting therapeutic trial of tocilizumab. Finally, the father of the index case also appears to have relevant clinical history. He was diagnosed with early onset RA, but the details of symptoms and investigations leading to his diagnosis are lacking since he is looked after by another hospital and he has minimal contact with his daughter with who he has not shared any further details regarding his health.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}

{"clinical_note": "A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital on October 2016 complaining of sicca syndrome, slight pain, and bilateral enlargement of parotid glands for 18 months; afterwards, a progressive bilateral periorbital swelling began. Patient did not report fever, cough, or any respiratory symptom. In 2015, Sjogren syndrome was diagnosed, according to clinical and histopathological American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria.[ Nevertheless, serum anti-nuclear, anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La antibodies and rheumatoid factor were persistently negative. Intermittent courses of low-doses steroids (prednisone 5\u201312.5 mg/d) and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/d were ineffective. Therapy had been stopped 6 months before our observation due to inefficacy. In her past medical history a moderate asthma for few years, requiring treatment with long acting beta2 agents and inhaled steroids, was noteworthy. Physical examination revealed evident swelling of salivary and lacrimal glands and bilateral yellow eyelids xanthelasmas (Fig. A and B). In the suspicion of an underlying indolent lymphoproliferative disease a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam was performed, showing patchy diffuse salivary and lacrimal glands enlargement together with the presence of multiple intra-glandular lymph nodes, without focal lesions (Fig. C). Moreover, a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the chest revealed a nodular lesion (diameter 3 cm) at the inferior right pulmonary lobe, with irregular margins and air bronchogram in the context (Fig. C). Bronchoalveolar lavage did not show pathogenic microorganisms, nor atypical cells; mixed mononuclear population (macrophages and lymphocytes) emerged at microscopic examination (quantitative analysis not done). An endoscopic biopsy failed to obtain diagnostic material, due to the scarce opacity of the lesion at the fluoroscopic guide. A whole-body positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET-CT) showed a modest increase in fludeoxyglucose up-take of lymph nodes (right axillary [SUVmax = 2.0], right upper paratracheal [SUVmax = 3.1], Barety loggia [SUVmax = 2.8], and subcarinal [SUVmax = 4.5]), parotid glands, and oral-rhino pharyngeal mucosa (Fig. A). Laboratory findings confirm the absence of serologic markers of connective tissue diseases, as well as signs of systemic inflammation. Serum IgG4 level was high, almost 4 folds UNL (794 mg/dL). Peripheral blood flow cytometry showed elevated CD19+ CD38bright CD27+ CD20- plasmablasts concentration (2713 cells/mL). Complete laboratory features are summarized in Table . Histological examination of an intra-parotid lymph node confirmed clinical hypothesis of IgG4-related disease (Fig. E\u2013J), according to the comprehensive diagnostic criteria 2012.[ After microbiological screening and informed consent, 1 cycle of 2 g rituximab (RTX) (1000 mg each 15 days apart together with methylprednisolone 100 mg single shot premedication) was administered. No chronic therapy was prescribed and no adverse effects were observed. Patient referred a rapid and complete improvement of exocrine glands swelling, and resolution of asthma, allowing bronchodilator therapy discontinuation, whereas xanthelasmas were still visible and unchanged. Remission persisted at the 12-months follow-up visit and was confirmed by MRI. Furthermore, neither the pulmonary lesion was visible at HRCT (Fig. D), or significant intra-thoracic 18FDG-uptake was detectable at PET control (Fig. B). IgG4-RD responder index[ (without IgG4 serum level) stepped down from 14 to 6, serum IgG4 levels roughly halved and plasmablasts concentration became undetectable (Table , Fig. ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 69-year-old male farmer presented to our hospital for evaluation of mild left lower abdominal pain. The onset of symptoms occurred ten months prior to his admission to our hospital. The patient was previously admitted to another provincial hospital and misdiagnosed with abdominal aortic dissection. His symptoms were not improved following the administration of oral antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors.\nPhysical examination was unremarkable except for upper right abdomen and periumbilical mild tenderness. Complete blood counts revealed mild anemia (Hb 10.2 g/dL) with normal leukocyte and platelet counts. Biochemistry showed elevated levels of \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (103.0 U/L, range: 7\u201345 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (144 U/L, range: 50\u2013135 U/L), renal dysfunction [serum creatinine (113.99 \u03bcmol/L, range: 45\u201384 \u03bcmol/L)], and elevated levels of serum amylase (138 U/L, range: 15\u2013125 U/L). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 84 mm/h (range: 0\u201320 mm/h). Total serum IgG levels were extremely high (18.9 g/L, range: 6.0\u201316.0 g/L), while IgG4 was approximately 6 times the normal limit (9.0 g/L, range: 0.08\u20131.4 g/L). Antinuclear antibody titer was 1:320, and his anti-SS-A antibody and antimitochondrial type 2 (M2) antibody were positive. Urinalysis showed a high level of beta-microglobulin, while proteinuria, occult blood, white blood cells and casts were within normal ranges. Other blood tests, including fecal occult blood, C-reactive protein, carbohydrate antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, and alpha-fetoprotein, were all within normal ranges. No abnormalities were found in the complement system. The T-SPOT.TB test was negative.\nRadiographs of the chest were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed left hydronephrosis and a periaortic mass (Fig. ). The mass surrounding the aorta appeared to be soft tissue rather than lymph nodes or tumor, suggesting left ureteral stenosis due to RPF, leading to hydronephrosis of the left kidney. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed no significant dilation of the common bile duct or the extra- and intra-hepatic bile ducts.\nThe patient underwent biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass using an autobiopsy gun under CT-guidance for further diagnosis of RPF. Penetrating tissue specimens stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed significant infiltration of lymphocytoplasma cells, fibrosis and fibrin accumulation (Fig. A). However, immunohistochemical staining did not show IgG4-positive plasmacytes in the retroperitoneal mass (Fig. B). Despite this, IgG4-related RPF was suspected, and with patient agreement we performed a less invasive lip biopsy in an attempt to obtain pathologic evidence. Although his labial salivary gland appeared normal, and the patient exhibited mild clinical features such as xerostomia and xerophthalmia, histological examination revealed a decreased number of gland bubbles and heavy infiltration of lymphocytes (100/HFP) (Fig. C). IgG4 staining was again negative (Fig. D). Together with positive expression of anti-SS-A antibody and positive Saxon and Schirmer tests, all findings fulfilled the American\u2013European Consensus Group classification criteria for pSS.[ In addition, the patient had intrahepatic cholestasis as well as the high serum level of antimitochondrial M2, and MRCP revealed neither strictures of the lower common bile duct nor a segmental stricture. Therefore, the presence of IgG4-SC was not determined. The patient was suspected to have underlying PBC.\nAfter ruling out of other possibilities, the patient was finally diagnosed with IgG4-related RPF and overlapping PBC complicated with pSS. With the patient's consent, 250 mg ursodeoxycholic acid was administered twice daily and 40 mg/d (1 mg/kg) of prednisone was administered for 30 days, which was then reduced to 30 mg/d for 15 days followed by 25 mg/d. At 45 days follow-up, the patient exhibited no signs of abdominal pain. A follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed that the retroperitoneal soft tissue lesion was markedly reduced (Fig. ). The ESR decreased to 29 mm/h, and IgG4 reduced to 3.18 g/L. Antinuclear antibody titer was significantly decreased to 1:100, and other laboratory data, including serum creatinine and biliary enzymes, were almost normal. The patient then received a long-term maintenance dose of 10 mg/d prednisone after steroid tapering. At six-month follow-up, the patient had no disease recurrence.", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 34-year-old man was referred with abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and loss of appetite for 6 months. At his first visit to the Department of Gastroenterology, he was evaluated by diagnostic electronic gastroscopy, which detected a mass in his throat. He had no history of dyspnea, dysphagia, odynophagia, foreign body feeling, or hoarseness. He subsequently visited the Department of Otolaryngology for throat discomfort after his last endoscopic examination. Physical examination showed that the patient was healthy-looking in appearance, with other characteristics, including his tonsils, thyroid gland, and lymph nodes, being unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a mass bulging out of his pharyngolaryngeal cavity (Fig. ) and flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a round laryngeal cyst (Fig. ).\nThe patient underwent endoscopic excision of the mass. Transoral fiberoptic intubation was performed under general anesthesia. A 2 \u00d7 2 cm mass was observed on the laryngeal surface and the right edge of the epiglottis, which appeared to be a cyst. Following suction to remove the cyst at its base, however, another mass was found to emanate from the underside of the cyst. This mass had the appearance of a papilloma, measuring about 1 \u00d7 1 cm (Figs. and ). Hence the patient was diagnosed as having concomitant tonsillar cyst and papilloma of the larynx, and the lesion was completely excised microsurgically using a bipolar radiofrequency plasma ablation (RFA) device. The entire lesion was sent to the pathologist and the pathologic findings showed that the squamous epithelium was in a papillary arrangement, and that under the squamous epithelium there was loose connective tissue with diffuse lymphoid infiltration, which confirmed the diagnosis (Fig. ).

{"clinical_note": "A 40-year-old female, with 3-month history of nasal obstruction and tinnitus was admitted in August 2012. Nasopharyngeal endoscopy and biopsy already had been performed in another hospital, showing nonkeratinizing undifferentiated NPC. This histopathologic diagnosis was confirmed in our center. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the nasopharynx and neck revealed the tumor was confined to the nasopharynx and the bilateral locoregional cervical lymph nodes enlarged with its greatest dimension of 2 cm. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound of abdomen, and whole-body bone scan ruled out distant metastases. So clinical staging was determined to be T1N2M0, IIIA according to American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM Staging System for NPC (7th ed, 2010).\nThe patient was treated with definitive IMRT to 7050 cGy for primary tumor and 6600 cGy for infiltrated regional lymph nodes. Concurrent chemotherapy based on cisplatin and 5-flurorouracil was administrated for 2 cycles and then 2-cycle chemotherapy was given subsequently to consolidate the efficiency with the same regimen. At the end of therapy, she obtained clinical complete response by nasopharynx and neck MRI.\nIn the initial therapy, the patient had undergone abdominal ultrasonography for 4 times, and no hepatic lesions were noted during this period. Nevertheless, when she came to our hospital for 3-month conventional follow-up in April 2013, abdominal sonogram revealed a liver cystic lesion with thin wall and smooth margin of 18 \u00d7 16 mm in the right liver lobe, and the lesion was interpreted as a simple liver cyst (Fig. ). Therefore, intense follow-up was suggested. Five months later, the cystic lesion enlarged to be 59 \u00d7 46 mm, with thick wall, but no signal of blood flow. Further CT presented a low density and heterogeneous lesion taking irregular wall and incomplete septa with strong contrast enhancement, indicating liver abscess (Fig. ). However, the patient was asymptomatic, with no fever, no right up abdominal pain, and no palpable mass by physical examination. On the contrary, laboratory findings were negative, liver function was normal, the white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and cancer-related antigen including \u03b1-fetoprotein were within the normal limits. Afterward the patient was transferred to another hospital for abscess drainage, and fluid culture was negative, but fine-needle aspiration was not performed. After drainage, the mass shrank significantly to one-third of the original size. However, it returned to previous size by CT 2 months later. Thus, the liver lesion was suspected to be malignant. Work-up examination including chest CT, pelvic MRI, emission CT for bones, gastroscopy, colonoscopy, and brain MRI excluded other lesion that may account for another primary tumor or extra-hepatic distance metastases from NPC. In addition, nasopharynx MRI showed no evidence of local relapse. On November 21, 2013, surgical resection was administrated both for histologic diagnosis and treatment, and the surgical margin was negative. Histopathologic examination definitely confirmed that the metastasis originated from NPC, since the cells of the surgical segment were similar to primary NPC on the morphology and they were positive in Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) encoded RNAs (EBERs) (Fig. ). No adjuvant chemotherapy was done after resection of the liver metastasis.\nHowever, relapse-free survival time lasted only for 8 months. In July 2014, 2 small cystic lesions were found on abdominal CT scan again, which were extremely similar to simple cysts (Fig. ). Further contrast-enhanced ultrasonography provided no sign of \u201cfast in and fast out,\u201d that is, a characteristic appearance in malignant carcinoma. As a result of multidiscipline team discussion, \u201cwatch and wait\u201d strategy was recommended. However, the number of hepatic lesions increased to 4, and the size of previous 2 cysts enlarged to be 3 cm within 3 months. The multidiscipline team members reached a consensus that the cystic lesions were metastases from NPC and suggested a palliative systematic chemotherapy. Then the patient received chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin for 6 cycles. During the first 3 cycles, partial lesions diminished in size, but stayed stable within the later 3 cycles. Nevertheless, the intraliver metastases exhibited significant progress soon after the chemotherapy. Subsequently, she underwent chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus targeted therapy with nimotuzumab, then single navelbine both for 3 cycles, but neither protocols showed notable effects on hepatic lesions. In addition, during the phase of chemotherapy with navelbine, the patient complained of chest pain, an irregular and fixed lump was found on her chest wall, approximately 3 cm in diameter. After local surgical resection was performed, the lump histologically was demonstrated to be an extra-hepatic metastasis from NPC. Considering the patient's good performance status score and grade A liver function according to the Child-pugh grading system, transcatheter hepatic artery chemoembolization (TACE) was administrated for 5 times from December 2015 to April 2016. After the TACE treatment, all the lesions were obviously decreased in size, with the largest metastasis decreasing from 64 \u00d7 53 to 33 \u00d7 32 cm (Fig. ). Meanwhile, carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) decreased from 125 to 60.8 U/mL, and squamous cell carcinoma antigen decreased from 2.8 to 0.9 ng/mL. Then 4 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin were offered to consolidate the clinical effects. In the next 6 months, her liver metastases maintained stable, but lung metastases were noted. In October 2016, the CT showed the liver metastases progressed. At last, she died of liver failure in March 2017.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

Consequently, the patient underwent bilateral anterior thoracotomies and transcatheter embolization of the pelvic vessels for acute resuscitation.\nAfter 14 days, the patient underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair of the descending aortic aneurysm. During the procedure, the patient experienced oxygen desaturation and cardiac arrest, and advanced cardiac life support was performed immediately. After return of spontaneous circulation, ECMO was set up due to persistent bradycardia and poor tissue perfusion, possibly caused by pulmonary embolism.\nHypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy was not improved after 1 week; therefore, the diagnosis of brain death was made by 2 senior doctors, and the family decided to enter the critical hospice pathway and donate his organs.\nOrgan donation was made at 21 days after the patient's trauma (7 days after the ECMO was placed). The patient's initial SCr on admission was 0.9 mg/dL and rose to 4.7 mg/dL at organ harvesting. During kidney procurement, we discovered an extremely abnormal appearance of the kidneys, which were \u201cvery dark blue\u201d in color (Fig. ). Rather than discarding the kidneys, we performed an on-table biopsy. Microscopically, this section showed only minimal interstitial fibrosis of parenchyma.

He did not report a clear cause of the abdominal pain. An abdominal exam revealed no distended abdomen, normoactive bowel sounds, no rebound tenderness, no tenderness in the left upper quadrant, no palpable mass. He lost 10 kg within 6 months unintentionally. He visited a gastroenterologist at a health clinic and received anti-infection therapy, which relieved the abdominal pain. However, he recently suffered from intermittent abdominal pain. He was subsequently referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nThe patient presented with fever and left upper abdominal pain. In a blood sample, the white blood cell count was 17.37 \u00d7 109 cells/L (neutrophils = 93.9%, lymphocytes = 3.1%, monocytes = 3.0%, eosinophils = 0.00%, basophils = 0.00%) and the platelet count was 289 \u00d7 109 cells/L when he first came to the outpatient department. The results of laboratory tests, including urine test, liver function tests, alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19\u20139, were all normal. Highly sensitive C-reactive protein was 56.6 mg/L (Table ). He had a 1-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and took medicine irregularly. He had no hepatitis or tuberculosis, and a human immunodeficiency virus serological test was negative. Upper abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse hepatic disease, spleen abscess with inflammatory exudate, and spleen calcification (Fig. A). A chest radiograph and CT scan showed chronic inflammation of the inferior lobe of the left lung, a small amount of fluid in the left chest, and thickening of the wall of the gastric fundus.\nThe patient was subsequently subjected to laparoscopic exploration and splenectomy. A histological examination of biopsies demonstrated obvious spleen enlargement, fibrosis, and necrosis of spleen parenchyma, presenting as \u201cfrozen\u201d lesions. Additionally, the tail of the pancreas and greater curvature of the stomach adhered to the spleen. A peritoneal cavity drainage tube was inserted in the splenic recess for the drainage of pus. A spleen specimen of 12 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 6 cm exhibited a number of divergent pus cavities, the largest of which had a diameter of 2 cm (Fig. B). Two days after surgery, the patient developed an effusion in the splenic fossa, which was successfully drained.\nWe suspected tuberculosis according to a histological analysis of HE-stained spleen sections. Typical granulomatous inflammation was observed in splenic pathological sections (Fig. C). However, the specific acid-fast staining test for tuberculosis was negative (data not shown). Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a B pseudomallei antibody preserved in our laboratory, and B pseudomallei in the splenic tissue sections were observed (Fig. D). Bacterial culture of the spleen pus for 72 hours revealed small, dry colonies with a typical wrinkled surface on blood agar (Fig. E). Bacteria isolated from the pus culture were identified as B pseudomallei using the commercial BD Phoenix-100 Automated Microbiology System (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Based on analyses of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the isolated strain was susceptible to ceftazidime (MIC, 4 \u03bcg/mL), meropenem (MIC, 2 \u03bcg/mL), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (MIC, 0.5 \u03bcg/mL).\nThe patient was treated with antibiotics intravenously for 15 days. On the day of admission, he initially received empirical anti-infective intravenous cefmenoxime and piperacillin-tazobactam. Owing to the lack of a clinical response, the treatment was changed to intravenous ceftazidime for 2 days, followed by oral TMP-SMX according to the results of a drug sensitivity test, and the patient exhibited a gradual improvement in clinical condition.

A pelvic examination showed a closed external cervical os and a normal uterus with tenderness. Her hemoglobin and serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels were 110 g/L and 7894 IU/L, respectively. A transvaginal sonogram showed a 1.2 \u00d7 1.4 \u00d7 1.5-cm-sized gestational sac implanted near the previous cesarean scar in the anterior wall of the uterine corpus (Fig. ). The gestational sac was bulging toward the serosa, with a 5-mm-thin layer of overlying myometrium. A pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a group of abnormal cystic component signal on the anterior wall of the uterine isthmus incision, measuring approximately 1.6 \u00d7 2.0 \u00d7 1.5 cm (Fig. ). The lesions, low signal on T1-weighted image (T1WI), and mixed with high signal on T2WI, were prominent in the uterine cavity.

Physical examination in the first presentation also included the contracture of the left foot in plantar-flexed position (Fig. ), and the only motor presentation of the CRPS was a reproducible tremor of the ipsilateral quadriceps muscles when the left knee was fully extended. The patient did not have any other visible or reproducible involuntary motor movement in her history or physical examination. The patient underwent a diagnostic left lumbar sympathetic block (LSB), followed by 5 additional LSBs with the same technique and medications (Fig. ). All the procedures were performed under local anesthesia and the patient was given lorazepam 1.5 mg orally as a sedative prior to procedures. In addition, for the 6th block, the patient was given DPH 50 mg IV prophylactically. The patient was placed prone and ipsilateral 30\u00b0 oblique view was obtained with fluoroscopy. The needle entry point was marked on the skin at the level of L3. After sterile preparation and draping, 3 mL of Lidocaine 1% was used to anesthetize the entry point. 20-gauge 3.5-inch introducer and 25-gauge 6-inch spinal needles were used. The spinal needle was directed to the anterolateral aspect of the L3 vertebral body. There was no paresthesia during advancement of the needles. After negative aspiration for blood and cerebrospinal fluid, 4 mL of Iohexol (180 mgI/mL) contrast was injected under live fluoroscopy to rule out intravascular injection. Appropriate distribution of the contrast in the anterolateral aspect of the L3 vertebral body was verified. Thereafter, 10 mL Bupivacaine 0.5% was injected at 1 mL increments after negative aspiration. Temperature measurements of bilateral plantar skin as well as pulse amplitude of the ipsilateral big toe with pulse oximetry were monitored continuously. Adequate sympathetic blockade was achieved after each block with confirmation of at least 2\u00b0C increase from the baseline temperature. Symptomatically, the patient responded well to the series of 6 LSBs with improvement of pain and other CRPS-related signs in the left ankle and foot. However, within 5-minutes of the completion of dose for each first 5 LSBs, the patient developed intense muscle spasms of the entire ipsilateral lower extremity (Video 1). After the first occurrence, various medications were tried to abort these intense spasms including postprocedure IV midazolam, oral cyclobenzaprine and oral baclofen, but they were not effective. The patient eventually responded immediately to IV DPH 50 mg. In the next 4 blocks, the patient was treated similarly with DPH 50 mg IV postprocedure each time with abrupt resolution of muscle spasms. For the sixth LSB, prophylactic treatment of DPH 50 mg IV was given before the procedure and the patient did not show any motor response on the 6th block.", "topic_list": "['knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

{"clinical_note": "An 11-year-old Taiwanese girl was admitted to our hospital with fever, dyspnea, and impending respiratory failure in May 2013. Physical examination revealed an enlarged nodular lesion over the right shoulder and several smaller nodular lesions on the abdomen. A complete blood count showed leukocytosis at 19.4 \u00d7 109 cells/L with 78% segmented neutrophils, 2% band form, 11% lymphocytes, and 9% monocytes. C-reactive protein level was 132.26 mg/L (normal: <5 mg/L), and serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 392 U/L (normal: 135\u2013260 U/L). High-resolution computed tomography showed multiple lung opacities and mediastinal, cervical, and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathies. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed no lymphoma cells.\nLymph node biopsies confirmed ALK+ ALCL diagnosis. Lymphoma cells were positive for CD2, CD3, CD4, CD30, ALK1, Bcl-6, MUM1, and TIA-1, but were negative for CD20, CD5, cyclin D1, CD10, TdT, CD8, and PD1. Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed a normal karyotype. Lymph nodes also displayed a relatively small number of small-to-large hallmark cells with reniform nuclei. Because of the rate small cell ALCL variant morphology resembling classic ALCL, it was misdiagnosed initially as ALK+ ALCL. Our patient achieved complete remission 4 months after diagnosis. Treatment involved an initial course of intravenous dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, and intrathecal administration of methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone, followed by 3 alternating cycles of A and B regimens every 3 weeks (A: dexamethasone, high-dose methotrexate, cytarabine, etoposide, and ifosfamide; B: dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate). New skin lesions were later noted in the lower back, and ALCL relapse was confirmed by skin biopsy 28 months after the initial treatment. Based on these findings we reviewed the histology of subcutaneous nodules biopsy performing additional immunohistochemistry for the ALK protein which revealed positivity in some of the CD3+ small lymphocytes as well as in rare dispersed previously unrecognized atypical large cells which also turned out to be CD30+. This prompted a diagnosis of subcutaneous nodule involvement by a small cell component of an ALK+ ALCL of the composite variant. Small cell variant of ALCL was confirmed by the reviewing pathologist.\nFurther treatment consisted of chemotherapy with 2 courses of high-dose CHOP (cyclophosphamide 2000 mg/m2 [day 1], hydroxydaunorubicin 90 mg/m2 [day 1], oncovin 2 mg/d [day 1], prednisolone 60 mg/m2 [days 1\u20135], mesnum [150% cyclophosphamide dose]), alternating with one course of standard ESHAP ([etoposide 40 mg/m2 [days 1\u20134]; cisplatin 25 mg/m2 [days 1\u20134], cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 per day [day 5], and prednisolone 250 mg [days 1\u20134]). After completion, the patient underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from her human leukocyte antigen-identical sister in December 2015. The timeframe from initial diagnosis to transplantation was 32 months. Before transplantation, the patient had residual skin lesions suggesting a partial remission, and bone marrow biopsy revealed no residual lymphoma cells. The patient received a conditioning regimen consisting of total body irradiation (13.2 Gy in 8 fractions on days \u22128 to \u22125), and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg on days \u22123 to \u22122). Infused cells and CD34+ cells were 10.14 \u00d7 108/kg and 10.65 \u00d7 106/kg, respectively.\nGraft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted of intravenous cyclosporine (5 mg/kg per day) beginning on day \u22123 and short-term methotrexate at 15 mg/m2 on day +1 and 10 mg/m2 on day +3 and +6. Rapid engraftment was obtained. Neutrophil count of >0.5 \u00d7 109/L and platelet count of >20 \u00d7 109/L were achieved on days 12 and 15, respectively, and complete donor chimerism was observed in a bone marrow sample obtained on day 42. After HSCT, a follow-up positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography showed complete metabolic remission. As of April 2018, the patient had achieved 28 months of continuous complete remission with a Lansky score of 100.\nA chest wall skin-punch biopsy demonstrated diffuse subdermal tumor cells infiltrates. Infiltrated lymphocytes consisted of small-to medium-sized cells with irregular nuclear contours, condensed chromatin, and moderately clear cytoplasm (Fig. A). Lymphocytes infiltrated the vascular wall with prominent rimming of individual endothelial cells (Fig. B).

She reported to not yet be suffering from angioedemas. The patient suspected that the skin reactions were triggered by exposure to the sun. Furthermore, the intake of cetirizine tablets had led to a worsening of the urticaria in the past, and sometimes she had experienced episodes of vertigo and nausea after intake. Thus, the patient had self-tested the tolerability of several antihistamines during symptom-free periods. She reported always having developed urticarial lesions approximately 2 hours after intake. The triggering drugs were Rupafin\u00ae (rupatadine), Telfast\u00ae (fexofenadine), Atarax\u00ae (hydroxyzine), Lorano\u00ae (loratadine), Wick Medi Nait\u00ae (among others, doxylamine succinate), and Grippostad\u00ae (among others chlorpheniramine maleat).

{"clinical_note": "A 43-year old woman was referred to our outpatient clinic due to gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. abdominal pain and bloating, diarrhea, gastro-esophageal reflux) and extra-intestinal manifestations (weakness, headache, foggy mind and limb numbness, skin rash, fibromyalgia-like symptoms and anemia) triggered by gluten and wheat ingestion. Symptoms started three years before, when the patient was 40 years old. IgA tTGA and EMA tested negative as well as duodenal biopsy showed a normal mucosal architecture on a gluten containing diet, thus ruling out CD diagnosis. Wheat allergy was excluded by means of IgE to gluten and wheat as well as by skin prick tests. As part of a thorough diagnostic work-up, the patient was found to be positive for HLA-DR7 and -DQ2 haplotype. Other laboratory data revealed positivity for antibodies to native gliadin of IgG class (AGA IgG, twice the upper normal limit; conversely, deamidated gliadin peptide IgG antibodies were negative) and low levels of folic acid, ferritin and vitamin D. Thyroid function tests disclosed a condition of autoimmune thyroiditis without hypothyroidism. An open 6-week trial with gluten-free diet (GFD) led to a significant symptomatic improvement in a few days and the patient remained symptom-free on GFD. The diagnosis of NCGS was validated by means of a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial as previously described (). The patient was advised to follow a strict GFD which led to a significant improvement of her clinical picture along with disappearance of IgG AGA. Notably, following GFD a significant improvement of folic acid, ferritin and vitamin D levels was observed at 6-month follow-up.\nConcerning the family history, the patient had two children, a 12-year old daughter and a 9-year-old son. None of them complained of gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms and they showed a normal growth without signs of short stature and weight loss. Laboratory data of these two children were unremarkable with normal value of hemoglobin, red blood cells, white cells and platelets. Values of vitamin D3, ferritin and folic acid were in the normal range in both children.\nCD antibody screening turned to be positive in both children, despite they were asymptomatic and with normal laboratory data. The 12-year old girl showed positivity for tTGA of IgA class at a very high titer (>10 times the upper normal limit) associated with EMA of IgA class. The genetic haplotype of this girl was positive for HLA-DR3 and -DQ2, corroborating the diagnosis of CD. Duodenal biopsy confirmed an active CD by showing a subtotal villous flattening (Marsh III) (, ) (). The 9-year old boy was positive at a low titer for tTGA of IgA class (1.5 times the upper normal limit) associated with a weak IgA EMA positivity.\nGenetic testing highlighted the same genetic pattern of the sister. Duodenal biopsy revealed the presence of normal villi, with a villous/crypt ratio >3:1, but with an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) (55 IELs/100 epithelial cells), consistent with a diagnosis of potential CD (). Both siblings were also positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) detected by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp2 cells. In the boy, ANA tests showed a speckled pattern at a low titer (1:80) with negativity for anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (ENA). The girl showed ANA positivity with homogeneous pattern at a very high titer (1:640) associated with ENA positivity (SSA-Ro52 +++). Both children underwent a rheumatological evaluation which was unremarkable for connective tissue disease. Due to the condition of active CD with the typical villous flattening, the girl started a GFD, which led to a significant decrease of antibody titer after 6 months. In contrast, the boy was left on a gluten containing diet as suggested for asymptomatic potential CD ().

In the last episode she took ibuprofen 600 mg every 8h for 2 weeks and colchicine 0.5 mg twice a day for 6 months. Physical activity was restricted for 6 months. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal but cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed latter demonstrated residual fibrosis in the lateral wall of left ventricle.\nThe patient remained asymptomatic until June 2017 when she complained of palpitations and mild chest pain. Physical examination, Electrocardiogram (ECG) and transthoracic echocardiography were normal but troponin I was positive (1.04 ng/mL; normal range < 0.04 ng/mL) so myopericarditis was assumed and the patient was admitted\nto the hospital and ibuprofen and colchicines were initiated. The next day and until discharge, troponin I remained negative and the patient was free from symptoms. Serology for virus, interferon gamma release assay and clinical or laboratory tests for autoimmune diseases were all negative. The possibility of a false positive test on admission was thought due to the immediate fall in troponin level. However, owing to the relief of symptoms with medication, myopericarditis could not be excluded and the patient was discharged on ibuprofen and colchicine at the same dose as before.\nThree weeks later she returned to the hospital complaining of similar symptoms. Once again, initial measurement of troponin I was positive (1.31 ng/mL) and incessant myopericarditis was assumed. Physical exam remained unremarkable as well as the ECG and transthoracic echocardiography. During hospitalization, measurements of troponin I remained always negative. She had a cardiac MRI once again but no signals of active myocarditis were detected and residual fibrosis remained as previously described (Fig. ). Once more, a false positive result was a possibility since the first measurements were performed by the emergency laboratory (Beckman Coulter Access AccuTnI+3\u00ae) and the next ones by the routine laboratory (Abbott Architect STAT high sensitive TnI\u00ae). To rule out a false positive result in the first measurement, performed by emergency laboratory, two samples of blood were collected at the same time and sent to both laboratories. The result was positive in the emergency laboratory (1.03 ng/mL) and negative in the routine laboratory (0.00 ng/mL). Although alkaline phosphatase activity was within the normal range (58 U/L; normal range 40-150 U/L), alkaline phosphatase interference was proved in the Beckman Coulter central laboratory.

After multiple lines of therapy, including most recently progressing on palbociclib and fulvestrant, the patient was switched to monotherapy with olaparib. Her rash began approximately three days after starting olaparib capsules at a dose of 300 mg twice daily. She subsequently developed progression of the erythematous nodules which became painful and limited her ambulation, bilateral lower extremity edema, fevers to 101.7\u00b0F (degrees Fahrenheit), and rigors. She tried diphenhydramine without any improvement in her symptoms, and patient then presented to the emergency department for evaluation. Her other home medications included levothyroxine, omeprazole, and cholecalciferol.\nHer vital signs were within normal limits. Her physical examination revealed multiple erythematous nodules over the bilateral distal lower extremities which were markedly tender to palpation, along with trace edema in her bilateral lower extremities (). Her basic metabolic profile was unremarkable, and her complete blood count demonstrated white blood count of 1.80 with absolute neutrophil count of 1200, hemoglobin of 11.2, and platelet count of 114. Her urinalysis was unremarkable, chest X-ray was normal, and blood cultures were sent. The patient was then admitted to inpatient Hematology-Oncology service for further evaluation of neutropenic fever. However, her infectious evaluation was unrevealing, and she then remained afebrile off antibiotics. Since this patient's symptoms and clinical examination were consistent with erythema nodosum, her olaparib was held. She was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as well as acetaminophen as needed for ongoing pain. She was discharged with close outpatient follow-up. Her nodules improved dramatically within 24 hours of stopping olaparib and completely resolved within a week of withholding olaparib.\nAt her subsequent outpatient follow-up appointment, the patient was resumed on olaparib with a slow titration of dose to her prior regimen of 300 mg twice daily. The first day she took the 300 mg BID dose, the patient developed recurrence of her erythema nodosum, and she was started on a course of prednisone with a resolution of her symptoms (). The patient was then restarted on olaparib at a reduced dose of 250 mg twice daily, but afterwards developed erythema nodosum again (). Her symptoms resolved after completing another short course of prednisone therapy. At her next follow-up appointment, the patient was later resumed on olaparib capsules at a dose of 200 mg twice daily. She has tolerated this therapy at a reduced dose without any significant recurrence of erythema nodosum requiring cessation of olaparib or use of prednisone therapy. This patient had a complete metabolic response to treatment in the previously described metastatic bone lesions, and the previously described focal liver FDG avidity was no longer seen; in addition, her CA27.29 normalized. Once olaparib tablets were commercially available, she was subsequently changed to therapy with olaparib tablets 300 mg twice daily.

Therefore, she received a 3-day course of steroids, consisting of methylprednisolone 500 mg intraoperatively, followed by 250 mg and 125 mg on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 2, respectively. She also received maintenance immunosuppression of tacrolimus with a target trough level of 6 ng/mL and mycophenolic acid (Myfortic\u00ae) 360 mg twice daily. Postoperatively, blood samples from the donor and recipient were sent for short tandem repeat (STR) analysis in order to determine monozygosity. Given the use of maintenance immunosuppression, opportunistic infection prophylaxis was provided with oral sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 400-80 mg daily for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, fungal prophylaxis with oral clotrimazole 10 mg four times daily and cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis with valganciclovir 900 mg daily. She experienced immediate graft function and was discharged with no complications on postoperative day (POD) 5 with a serum creatinine (SCr) of approximately 1.0 mg/dL. The STR analysis occurred one week after transplant and demonstrated allelic identity at all 16 loci tested, consistent with monozygosity. Therefore, the transplant team decided to discontinue maintenance immunosuppression. Tacrolimus was stopped 12 days after transplant, and mycophenolate was stopped one week later. Infection prophylaxis was also discontinued once maintenance immunosuppression was stopped. She continues to have stable graft function at 5 years after transplant, with a baseline SCr of approximately 1.5 mg/dL (). She has experienced several episodes of mild acute kidney injury, which were attributed to her poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. She underwent a protocol allograft biopsy at 3 months after transplant, which showed no significant interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, minimal arterial sclerosis, and mild arteriolar hyalinosis, with no evidence of acute allograft rejection. At 17 months after transplant, she underwent a second biopsy due to an elevation in SCr. The second biopsy showed mild tubular injury, without evidence of allograft rejection. No interventions were indicated based on the results of the 2 allograft biopsies, beside attempts to optimize her glycemic control.

{"clinical_note": "A 71-year-old Caucasian female received a living related renal transplant from her identical twin sister. She developed ESRD due to chronic cystitis related to ureteral obstruction. Prior to transplantation, she made normal amounts of urine and had been on hemodialysis for 6 months. Her past surgical history included an ileal loop conduit urinary diversion and ileostomy drainage bag placement. Given the recipient's structural bladder anomaly, a ureteral anastomosis was made to the small bowel over a 6-French 30 cm double-J stent which extended from the renal pelvis out to the ileal conduit. Prior to transplant, monozygosity was confirmed via an STR analysis, which revealed that she was identical to her sister in all 16 polymorphic gene loci that were evaluated. Additionally, she was found to be a six-antigen match on HLA typing and had a negative anti-human globulin (AHG) crossmatch. Interestingly, a class II donor specific antibody (DSA) to DPB1\u221705:01/DPA1\u221702:02 with a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 1,359 was identified four months prior to transplant. The antibody screening was repeated 10 days prior to transplant and revealed an MFI of 1,458. Based on the confirmation of monozygosity, the transplant team proceeded with transplantation without maintenance immunosuppression. She received a 3-day steroid taper course consisting of methylprednisolone 500 mg intraoperatively, followed by 250 mg and 125 mg intravenously on POD 1 and 2, respectively. She did not receive antibody induction therapy or further maintenance immunosuppression beyond the corticosteroids. Due to rapid immunosuppression withdrawal, she did not receive prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. She experienced immediate graft function, although her SCr was initially slow to decline (). Her hospital course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged home on POD 4 with a SCr of 2.3 mg/dL. She experienced a urinary tract infection (UTI) approximately 1 month after transplant, which resolved after ureteral stent removal and treatment with a 7-day course of oral ciprofloxacin. At 1 year after transplant, she continues to have excellent graft function with a baseline serum creatinine of 1.0 ng/mL (). A protocol kidney biopsy was attempted approximately 3 months after transplant, which however could not be performed due to lack of a clear window. Repeat posttransplant surveillance DSA screening with high resolution typing at the time of the attempted biopsy revealed persistence of Class II DPB1\u221705:01/DPA1\u221702:02 antibody, with a stable MFI of 1,030.

She did not have any known medical illness and has never taken any medication during the entire course of the index pregnancy except iron folate which was prescribed during the ANC visit.\nShe had spontaneous onset of labor and the membrane was ruptured spontaneously intrapartum. She gave birth to a 2330-gram female neonate after 5 hours of labor at a local health center. Baby had good APGAR score. Health care providers at the health center noticed defect at the back of the baby and referred her to Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (HUCSH) with the diagnosis of spinal bifida.\nDuring the initial evaluation at HUCSH the baby was active, vital signs were in the normal limits, and all neonatal reflexes were intact. There was 4x4 cm pink mass protruding through the introitus, cervical os is noted at the tip of the mass, the external genitalia appears normal, no discharge or bleeding from the mass, and the mass was reducible digitally and increases in size when the baby cries (see ).

She denied any headaches, vertigo, fevers, head trauma, urinary symptoms, or use of illicit substances. There was no history of psychosis, schizophrenia, mania, or depression and a review of her medication list for any potential hallucinogenic agents did not indicate a pharmacologic etiology. Her past medical history was comprised of two prior strokes, the most recent being two years ago that involved the right frontal lobe. MRI of the brain at the time also showed evidence of an old right parietal lobe infarct. An echocardiogram during that hospitalization revealed a severely decreased left ventricular function and the patient was initiated on warfarin for anticoagulation. Since the two prior cerebral infarcts, the patient and her husband denied noting any behavioral changes, cognitive impairment, or any focal neurologic deficits. On presentation, she appeared disheveled and exhibited a flat affect with minimal verbalization. Physical examination revealed only a left hemianopia without hemiplegia. All cranial nerves were evaluated as well as gait, cerebellar function, and proprioception, which were all found to be normal. The patient was alert and oriented with intact mentation.\nShe was initially admitted to the psychiatric unit for further evaluation where the patient participated in daily activities and reported no symptoms. Given the acute onset of her symptoms, laboratory studies and brain images were obtained in order to rule out an organic etiology. A complete blood count was normal and a basic metabolic panel revealed normal electrolytes and renal function. Additional labs included liver function tests, lipid panel, cardiolipin antibody, and TSH, which were all normal and RPR was nonreactive. A urine sample was negative for urinary tract infection and 8-panel urine drug screen was negative. An MRI of the brain was obtained, which revealed old ischemic infarcts within the right parietal and frontal lobes along with a new acute right occipital lobe infarct with hemorrhagic transformation (). The patient was subsequently transferred to the medical unit for further workup and management.\nThe patient was placed on telemetry, which showed normal sinus rhythm. Given the involvement of multiple brain territories and circulations, a cardioembolic source of stroke was highly suspected. A cardiologist evaluated the patient and performed a transesophageal echocardiogram that revealed a low ejection fraction of less than 20%. In addition, a bubble study was performed that was positive for a patent foramen ovale.

{"clinical_note": "A 34-year-old female who has no previous clinical illness presented in 2000 with a large irregular mass, estimated clinically to be around 5 \u00d7 6 cm by physical examination, involving the right breast while she was lactating. There were no other signs or symptoms. FNA was done to rule out breast cancer, and the specimen showed few foamy macrophages and rare clusters of ductal cells, with focal secretory lactational changes. Based on that, it was determined that the specimen was negative for malignancy. The tumor continued to grow, and in June 2004, FNA of the right breast was repeated and showed large staghorn-shaped sheets of uniform ductal cells with no cytologic atypia along with myoepithelial cells. There were fragments of fibrotic stroma and bare nuclei scattered in a bloody background, and so, a diagnosis of fibroadenoma was made. Two months later, the patient underwent excision of the tumor in another healthcare facility. Examination of the slides showed an overgrowth of epithelial and stromal components in pericanalicular and intracanalicular patterns with irregular large cystic spaces showing protruding leaf-like structures (). The stromal cells showed plump elongated slightly dysmorphic nuclei with occasional prominent nucleoli. Other areas showed significant cellular growth of the stromal spindle cells which appeared to be arranged in long intersecting fascicles and growing in herringbone pattern (). Within the spindle cell growth, extracellular mucin was noted. One focus showed an exclusive spindle cell growth which was moderately atypical with plump elongated hyperchromatic nuclei. Numerous mitosis was found, up to 20 in 10 high power fields in this focus. Entrapped epithelial ductal elements were occasionally seen in other areas exhibiting ductal epithelial hyperplasia. These features were consistent with malignant phyllodes tumor with stromal fibrosarcomatous overgrowth. The patient subsequently underwent mastectomy as the margins were focally involved. During the procedure, a mass measuring around 3-4 cm was found in the most posterior aspect of the breast and there was some indication that it may have invaded the pectoralis major muscle. All the breast tissue, the tumor, and some of the muscle fibers were removed. On gross examination, there were multiple tumor masses in the inner lower and outer upper quadrants, the largest being 3 cm. On microscopy, there was proliferation of atypical spindle and elongated plump cells with pleomorphic nuclei and occasional prominent nucleoli. Extracellular mucin was also identified. The atypical stromal cells formed herringbone fascicular growth pattern reminiscent to fibrosarcoma and numerous mitosis averaging around 14 mitosis in 10 high power fields. No residual phyllodes tumor elements were identified. The tumor nodules had a well-demarcated margin with focal infiltration of surrounding breast and adipose tissue. No lymphovascular invasion, necrosis, or heterologous differentiation was seen. All surgical margins and muscle fibers were not involved by the tumor. The skin and nipple did not show any involvement either. All these histological features were identical to those identified in her previous lumpectomy except that there was more pronounced atypia and no residual epithelial component of phyllodes tumor identified. No lymph nodes were identified. A year later, the patient began to suffer from acute bouts of pancreatitis and was admitted several times for this. In March of 2006, abdominal CT was performed and showed a heterogenous low attenuation soft tissue mass involving the head and body of the pancreas and was extending upwards. The celiac vessels and its branches were going through this mass but did not show any significant narrowing. There was obvious atrophy of the pancreatic tail and dilatation of the pancreatic duct. The mass was in contact with the anterior aspect of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with no clear fat plane in between (). Biopsy of the pancreatic mass showed uniform proliferation of elongated spindly cells which had coarse chromatin and mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism. Some cells had plump hyperchromatic nuclei. Numerous mitotic figures were identified (). The background showed variable amounts of collagen and stroma with focal areas of myxoid appearance. Immunohistochemical staining showed strong positivity for vimentin; however, the cells were negative for actin, S100, and cytokeratin (). These findings were consistent with metastatic fibrosarcoma of the pancreas secondary to her primary breast lesion. Due to the location, extent, and nature of the condition, the case was deemed unresectable. Chemotherapy was initiated; and in the little chance that the tumor shrunk enough, the possibility of resecting the metastasis would be entertained. In January 2007, the patient presented to the ER with severe epigastric pain, where she collapsed, was hypotensive, and subsequently admitted. On examination, a tender mass in the epigastric area was felt. Urgent CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast showed a pseudoaneurysm in the splenic artery measuring around 3.5 cm. There was also expansion of the retroperitoneal mass and blood in the intraperitoneal cavity. There was heterogenous enhancement in the liver most probably indicating liver infarct. In addition, there were areas of the IVC which had markedly thinned wall and areas suspicious for active bleeding, especially from the proximal splenic artery (). The pancreatic fibrosarcoma had grown and eroded branches of the celiac artery with bleeding pseudoaneurysm along with infarct of the liver, spleen, and adjacent organs. The patient continued to be hypotensive with abdominal distention due to severe intra-abdominal bleeding and developed multiorgan failure and hemorrhagic shock leading to her death.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

The burns on her right ankle and foot and left knee seemed to be deeper (fourth degree). Initial surgical treatment occurred 2 h after the burns (Day 0) and included releasing incisions from knee to toes in both her lower limbs. The initial dressing was composed of silver sulfadiazine 1% and general resuscitation included fluid resuscitation and invasive monitoring. Then, three surgical procedures were required to excise the devitalized tissues, including muscles and tendons of both lower limbs. Thighs and upper third of her legs were covered with skin autografts. Tibia and fibula were exposed on the right limb. Toes were amputated through the metatarso-phalangeal joints. Ankle, mediotarsal and tarso-metatarsal capsules were burnt, some joints were open (Fig. ) and vasculo-nervous pedicle was at high risk of exposure. Consequently, the lower extremity required covering with vascularized tissues. Local pedicled flap was not an option for the ankle and foot; therefore, we opted for a latissimus dorsi musculo-cutaneous flap with vertical skin paddle (4 \u00d7 20 cm) centered on the main perforator of the anterior branch of the thoraco-dorsal pedicle, identified with an echo-doppler. The flap was performed on day 27 post-burn. On the pre-operative CT-angiogram of the lower limb, we noticed that the anterior tibial artery was thrombosed just at the second third of the leg. The posterior tibial pedicle was preserved to ensure the vascularization of the remaining tissues of the foot. The thoraco-dorsal pedicle was end-to-end anastomosed to the anterior tibial artery. The anastomoses were difficult to perform because inflammatory tissues, full of oedema, surrounded the vessels. The skin paddle of the latissimus dorsi flap was originally intended for flap monitoring (Fig. ). The free flap was a success, and 3 weeks later, the right limb was almost totally covered either with skin graft or with the flap. Nevertheless, the left patellar tendon was still exposed and needed to be covered with a flap (Fig. ). The options discussed were to perform a pedicled flap, to perform a second free flap or to recycle tissues from the previous flap. We performed a vascular mapping of the flap with the use of an echo-doppler. The main pedicle of the flap was divided into two branches. The skin paddle was vascularized by this anterior branch from which a main perforator was identified. The choice between a musculo-cutaneous flap and a perforator flap was discussed. As a cross-leg had to be performed, the risks of rupture due to excessive tension or of thrombosis due to desiccation of the perforator were considered as too high. Consequently, a musculo-cutaneous cross-leg flap was harvested from the previous flap. The flap was partially raised from the right limb including the anterior branch of the thoraco-dorsal pedicle and a cross leg was performed to cover the left patellar tendon. Both legs were immobilized together using an external fixation (Hoffmann apparatus, Fig. ). The donor site was covered with a skin graft. After a period of 3 weeks, the skin paddle was progressively cut from the previous flap after partial occlusion clamps were tested. One week later, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center for further treatment. The wounds were completely healed 9 weeks after the burns. At 6 months post-burns, the patient was able to walk and left the rehabilitation centre (Fig. ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "An 89-year-old man with dementia was hospitalized in our department with severe pneumonia. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed left lower lobe consolidation and a small high-density lesion suspected to be a foreign body in the left main bronchus. We performed bronchoscopy one week after initiation of antibiotic treatment, and his oxygen demand decreased from 7 to 4 L/min.\nBefore bronchoscopy, we moulded a 3D model of the bronchial foreign body using a low-cost 3D printer (UP! Plus2; OPT, Tokyo, Japan) with an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) resin filament. It took approximately 1 h from uptake of the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine chest CT images to the completion of the 3D model. We found that the model had the shape of a molar tooth. Because this 3D printer utilizes a fused filament fabrication (FFF) prototyping system, the surface of the model becomes moderately rough. Therefore, we dipped the model in the ABS solvent eSolve (Kaneko Chemical, Saitama, Japan), a halogen alkylate, to make the surface smoother, resembling a real tooth .\nUsing this 3D model, we simulated grasping of the foreign body with all available types of grasping forceps. Although we failed to grasp it with several types of biopsy forceps, an alligator forceps, and a five-pronged grasping forceps, we succeeded using a basket-type forceps, a retrieval net, and a shark-tooth forceps, especially when grasping the recess site of the 3D model (Fig. ).\nBecause space was present around the foreign body in the left main bronchus on chest CT, we initially planned to use a basket-type forceps or a retrieval net. However, several days after planning, a chest radiograph showed that the foreign body had moved to the right bronchus. When inserting the bronchoscope, a dental foreign body covered with mucinous sputum was stuck in the right upper bronchus. Because the recess site of the foreign body was turned to the peripheral side, we scraped it out to the truncus intermedius using a retrieval net. We could recognize the recess site and thus grasped and removed it with a shark-tooth forceps as performed in the simulation (Fig. ). It took just 9 min from bronchoscope insertion to foreign body removal, without adverse events.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

He had no prior medical history and was a smoker of 40 pack-years. On physical exam, he had mild fine bibasilar crackles on lung exam without wheezing. His laboratory values were all normal, with the exception of his arterial blood gas analysis, which showed a lower PaO2 of 74.4 mmHg on room air. His serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level was high (1655 U/mL). Pulmonary function testing revealed severe irreversible obstructive ventilatory dysfunction with normal diffusing capacity of the lung (Fig. ). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed irregular wall thickening of the trachea and bilateral bronchi (Fig. ). In addition, there was bilateral bronchiectasis, and mediastinal and both hilar lymphadenopathy were noted. Flexible bronchoscopy demonstrated a diffuse irregular surface of the tracheal and bilateral bronchial mucosa and multiple macroscopic submucosal nodules involving the trachea, the distal trachea above the major carina, and throughout the left and right main bronchi (Fig. ). Endobronchial biopsy of the mucosa on the major carina showed a population of small atypical lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei of irregular nuclear contours. These atypical lymphocytes were CD20 positive B-cells co-expressing CD5, blc-2, and Cyclin D1, leading to the diagnosis of MCL (Fig. ). Further positron emission tomography (PET)-CT imaging showed the persistence of FDG-avid lymphadenopathy within the chest (SUVmax 4.2) and FDG-avid wall thickening of the trachea and bilateral main bronchi (SUVmax 2.8), as well as FDG-avid nasopharyngeal soft tissue thickening (SUVmax 6.8). Biopsies of the nasopharyngeal mucosa further demonstrated B-cells with the same immunophenotype as the endobronchial biopsy, and 11;14 translocation was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using a CCND1/IGH probe. Bone marrow biopsy showed an increased lymphocyte percentage of 23%, with 1% of immature lymphocytes, and a positive immunoglobulin rearrangement (FR1-JH(+), FR2-JH(+), FR3-JH(+), Vk-Jk(+), Vk-Kde + intronKde(\u2212)). Bone marrow flow cytometry demonstrated a surface kappa clonal B-cell population with CD5, CD20, and FMC-7 expression.

Twenty-one hours before admission, he had been kicked in the region of his left lateral abdomen. On admission, the patient\u2019s face was pale, and his Glasgow coma scale was recorded at 13/15 (E: 3, V: 4, M: 6). A physical examination revealed severe tenderness on the left lateral abdomen with moderate abdominal distension. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 80/50 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 30/min, respectively.\nContrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed a severe intraparenchymal hematoma and multiple lacerations of the spleen with a large amount of hemoperitoneum (Fig. a, b). The splenic hilar vessels were not injured (Fig. c), and there were no signs of active bleeding. His injury was diagnosed as grade III on the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) splenic injury scale.

{"clinical_note": "An 80-year-old man (Patient 1) received a diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma of the right kidney after partial nephrectomy. One year later, computed tomography showed a right lumbar mass, and surgical specimens revealed clear cell carcinoma. The patient subsequently underwent afatinib treatment. However, therapy was discontinued as a result of intolerable adverse effects. Eighteen months later, PET-CT showed multiple metastases, including to the right pleural tubercle, thoracic vertebra, lumbar vertebra, left ilium, and humerus. In consultation with the radiation therapist, he received stereotactic radiotherapy to the right lung; however, a new left upper gingival soft tissue mass was found during the radiotherapy, and tumor metastasis was confirmed by biopsy. He was then treated with pembrolizumab combined with CIK cell transfer. CIK cells were prepared as described previously (). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated and cultured under sterile conditions in 1640 medium containing anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, interferon \u03b3, interleukin-2, and RetroNectin. After culturing the cells for 10\u201314 days, a target dose of about 6 \u00d7 109 CIK cells with over 95% viability was obtained and tested for biological contaminants. Cells were then prepared in sodium chloride solution containing 2% albumin before transfusion. He achieved a complete response following treatment with four cycles of pembrolizumab combined with eight cycles of CIK cell transfer (Table S1 in Supplementary Material) and continues to be in remission on day 537 of the first dose of pembrolizumab treatment (Figure A). The patient had gingivitis after first cycle of pembrolizumab and pneumonia after second cycle of pembrolizumab, for which he received systematic antibiotic treatment. He did not receive glucocorticoids or other immunomodulating agents during his treatment with pembrolizumab and CIK cells.\nA 63-year-old man (Patient 2) received a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma after biopsy of a right lower lobe lung mass. CT scans showed that this patient had developed multiple metastases, including mediastinal, right hilar, and anterior superior phrenic lymph nodes, and also to the sternum. His disease progressed following first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and second-line S-1, a second-generation oral fluoropyrimidine composed of tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil (). He was then treated with pembrolizumab combined with CIK cell transfer as third-line therapy. Follow-up imaging showed a near-complete response after treatment with eight cycles of pembrolizumab in combination with seven cycles of CIK cell transfer (Table S1 in Supplementary Material), and the patient continues to be in remission 185 days posttreatment (Figure B). No adverse events occurred during treatment in this patient.\nGiven that PD-1 pathway blockade induces a clinical response in subsets of cancer patients, defining biomarkers that predict therapeutic effects and adverse events is crucial. Recent studies have suggested an association between clinical responses and several promising biomarkers, including PD-1, PD-L1, CD3, tumor mutation burden (TMB), deficient DNA mismatch repair status (dMMR), and insertions and deletions (indels) (). To examine the relationship between PD-1, PD-L1, or CD3 expression in the tumors and antitumor responses elicited by anti-PD-1 antibodies combined with CIK cell transfer, we evaluated pretreatment tumor biopsies from both patients using immunohistochemistry and found that the tumor biopsy from Patient 1 exhibited moderate CD3+ T cell infiltration, but no PD-1 or PD-L1 expression (Figure A). The tumor cells from Patient 2 strongly expressed PD-L1, and there was extensive tumor infiltration by CD3+ T cells; however, no PD-1 staining was seen (Figure B). It has been reported that frameshift indels are more prevalent in renal cell carcinoma compared with other tumor types and are associated with enhanced T-cell activation (). Across all tumor types, clear cell renal carcinoma was found to have the highest proportion of coding indels, 0.12, a 2.4-fold increase when compared with the pan-cancer average, 0.05 (). We analyzed the whole-exome sequences of pretreatment tumors and patient-matched blood samples. We observed an indel proportion value of 0.08 and an indel count of 4 in patient 1, while these values were 0.04 and 5, respectively, in patient 2. We also found that tumors from both patients harbored non-synonymous single nucleotide variant (nsSNV) mutations. The TMB in patient 2 was higher than that in patient 1 (2.4 versus 0.8/Mb, respectively); however, no mutations in MMR-associated genes occurred in either patient (Figure ). Based on these data, we hypothesize that nsSNVs, along with higher indel mutations, in patient 1 with renal cell carcinoma and nsSNVs along with higher TMB in patient 2 with lung cancer correlate with tumor-infiltrating CD3+ lymphocyte density. Therefore, CD3+ T cell infiltration in baseline tumor biopsies may be a potential biomarker to predict which patients will benefit most from PD-1 blockade in combination with CIK cell therapy, although this will need to be confirmed in larger numbers of patients.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

{"clinical_note": "Patient was a 40-year-old male who sustained bilateral grade 3b tibia fractures (mechanism of injury: bark stripping machine at a sawmill) (Fig. ). He had no other injuries and no co-morbidities.\nFollowing initial surgical management, a temporary fixator was applied along with appropriate debridement (Hoffmann Express Stryker\u00ae comprising of four half pins and a standard two-bar configuration) (Fig. ). The soft tissue defect was equivalent to a Gustilo\u2013Anderson IIIB, and we were unable to have a flap applied [].\nSimilar to the benchmark method of \u2018fix and flap\u2019 which usually includes two scheduled surgeries, the bayonet method too required two scheduled surgeries, however with the advantage of circumventing the need to be dependent on plastic surgeon\u2019s availability: the first surgery for frame application, deformation and closure and the second for frame removal. In this case, there was also one unscheduled theatre visit in order to extend the frame across the ankle for the equinus correction.\nAt the 48 h, first definitive surgery a tibial bayonet procedure was performed, a technique that has been established at the Ilizarov Institute in Kurgan (AM. Cherkashin and ML. Samchukov, personal communication). Sub-muscular elevation and creation of a soft tissue envelope (no periosteal elevation or stripping) were performed (Fig. ). At this sitting, a standard two-ring/four-half-pin hexapod frame was applied (OrthoFix TL-Hex\u00ae).\nThe wound was a 270-degree circumferential skin wound, from postero-lateral to postero-medial aspect of the middle third of the leg. The underlying muscle bellies were intact and did not require repair. Sensation and motor function were present distally (the latter was decreased). The struts were kept loose in order to allow bayonetting. The distal fragment was inserted into the soft tissue pocket. There was no interposing tissue, and the bone fragments were overlapped until the skin edges could be opposed in a tension-free manner (Fig. ). The struts were locked in place, and the wound was closed primarily.\nA latent period of 6 weeks followed with the foot elevated in order to allow the skin to heal and for the oedema to settle. Initial lengthening was achieved by increasing the length of all struts sequentially and equally. The distraction rate allowed a lengthening of 1\u20132 mm/day. Once length was restored, the TL-Hex\u00ae software was used based on orthogonal radiographs for software referencing to allow realignment of the two fragments.

This analysis demonstrated spontaneous chromosome breakage - 0.16 breaks per cell (reference 00.00\u20130.08) and DEB-induced chromosome breakage - 2,32 breaks per cell (reference 0.00\u20130.08), confirming the FA diagnosis. He was hospitalized due to the persistent anemia and progressive neutropenia. Oxymetholone (50 mg/day) was the initial treatment. A partial hematological response was achieved, even with oxymetholone dose reductions due to liver toxicity. However, the hematological parameters worsened and erythropoietin (EPO) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were associated, as well as danazol 200 mg/day was introduced. He also received multiple blood transfusions during the treatment but no satisfactory response was achieved. At this time, BM evaluation revealed dysplastic megakaryocytes, intense dyserythropoiesis and 11% of myeloblasts. Immunophenotypic analysis of BM cells also revealed 11% of myeloblasts expressing CD34/CD13/CD11b (54.25%), HLA-DR/CD33/CD7 (31,54%), dysplastic erythropoiesis (CD36/CD71/CD235a), dysgranulopoiesis (CD13/CD16/CD11b/Cd33/CD64/CD15,CD45) and monocytic lineage expressing CD14/CD64/CD36/HLA-DR,CD45.

Her first four treatment cycles were well tolerated. Treatment related side effects included hypertension, subclinical hypothyroidism, non-nephrotic range proteinuria and mild diarrhea.\nDuring a routine study clinic visit the patient was found to be in sinus tachycardia. Upon further questioning, the patient noted progressive dyspnea on exertion and fatigue over the previous month and was therefore admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for further evaluation. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 37\u00b0C, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, a manual blood pressure of 90/72 mmHg without orthostatic changes and oxygen saturation ranging from 93 to 97% on room air. Physical examination findings were notable for a normal jugular venous pressure, regular heart rate without a prominent P2, clear breath sounds, and warm extremities without edema. Intravenous fluid was administered for possible dehydration due to diarrhea, but symptoms did not improve. A portable chest x-ray revealed hazy bibasilar interstitial markings (Fig. ). Laboratory studies revealed a hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL (normal range 11.2-15.7 g/dl), a platelet count of 159 k/\u03bcL (normal range 173-369 k/\u03bcL), normal coagulation indices (PT 13.8 s; aPTT 35.5 s; thrombin time 15.8 s), a D-dimer of 0.98 \u03bcg/mL (normal range 0.00\u20130.50 \u03bcg/mL), a fibrinogen of 517 mg/dL (normal range 177\u2013466 mg/dL), a pro-brain natriuretic peptide of 4541 pg/mL (normal range 0\u2013124 pg/mL) and a troponin-T of 0.022 ng/mL (normal range 0.000\u20130.009 ng/mL). Echocardiography demonstrated a dilated right ventricle with decreased function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) of 8 mm; normal \u226517 mm) and an elevated right ventricular systolic pressure of 67 mmHg, new findings compared to her baseline echocardiogram completed just 4 months earlier. Cardiac MRI, performed to evaluate for possible treatment related myocarditis, demonstrated severely reduced right ventricular function (ejection fraction of 27%; normal 61\u00b110%) with volume and pressure overload consistent with pulmonary hypertension, but no evidence of myocarditis. A CT angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary emboli, however there was a prominence of interstitial markings (Fig. ), the main pulmonary artery was enlarged (Fig. ) and the right atrium and ventricle were both severely dilated (Fig. ). A ventilation (Fig. ) - perfusion (Fig. ) scan (VQ) demonstrated mismatched perfusion defects along the pleural margins that were interpreted as a high probability of pulmonary emboli. Doppler ultrasonography revealed no evidence of venous thrombosis in the lower extremities. Despite the equivocal findings, therapeutic anti-coagulation was started for possible pulmonary emboli.\nOver the ensuing 10 days the patient\u2019s clinical course progressively deteriorated heralded by a syncopal event and the development of significant resting hypoxemia. The patient was referred for right and left heart catheterization which confirmed pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension with an associated low cardiac output state (Table ). Vasodilator challenge with nitric oxide (40 ppm) plus 100% oxygen paradoxically increased pulmonary artery mean and occlusion pressure, but did not result in symptomatic pulmonary edema. Balloon occlusion pulmonary venous blood sampling did not reveal any circulating tumor cells. Aggressive therapy for right heart failure was initiated including intravenous diuresis, inotropic support and pulmonary vasodilator therapy. Riociguat was initiated due to the concern for possible chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Ultimately, intravenous epoprostenol was added due to persistent symptoms of severe right heart failure. Soon after starting epoprostenol the patient became severely hypoxic. As a result, pulmonary vasodilator therapy was discontinued and she was treated with diuretics and high flow oxygen. Given her advanced disease and poor functional status her protocol treatment was stopped and she was discharged home with hospice care. She died 1 day later and an autopsy was performed.\nGross examination of the lungs showed scattered white plaques, nodular and gritty on palpation, covering the pleural surface of the lower lobes. Microscopic sections of the lung showed metastatic carcinoma with lymphangitic spread (Fig. ) within the septa and subpleural spaces with associated congestion and fibrosis. These findings were associated with fibromuscular thickening of lymphatic vessels which may represent a type of desmoplastic response to lymphatic obstruction. Pulmonary arterioles (Fig. , ) were occluded by organized thrombi, some with evidence of recanalization, as well as smooth muscle proliferation and ingrowth of fibroblasts. Some arteries showed fresh thrombi with metastatic tumor foci. Pulmonary venules were also occluded with ingrowth of fibroblasts. Some of these vessels showed evidence of chronic occlusion and recanalization, (Fig. ) while others were completely occluded. No tumor cells were identified in any venules. No evidence of infection or pneumonia was identified.

{"clinical_note": "A 6-year-old neutered female Persian cat presented to the \u201cCztery \u0141apy i Ty\u201d veterinary clinic, Poland due to strong psychomotor agitation turning into aggression. The owner described the animal as \u201cabsent-minded\u201d, disoriented, not reacting when called and behaving \u201cstrangely\u201d. The cat walked around aimlessly, tried jumping into inaccessible areas, ran around the room, then hid and attacked people. This behavior was accompanied by loud meowing and hissing. The owner observed that prior to the aggression episodes, the cat had mydriatic pupils, which she believed showed \u201cstrong fear\u201d. The cat demonstrated increased thirst, polyuria, attacks of gluttony mixed with periods of inappetence. During the attacks, the animal was not able to eat or drink by itself. According to the owner, the behavior of the animal made the members of the household afraid of it as it clapperclawed and bit its carers during the attacks. The periods of agitation and aggression were mixed with periods of normal behavior.\nWhen the cat began to have sialorrhoea, sneezed and was not able to swallow, the owner sought veterinary assistance. The cat was examined clinically and then hospitalized for 3 weeks. A complete blood count and basic blood biochemical parameters were evaluated and found to be within normal range.\nThe cat was also clinically observed for symptoms of rabies over a 15-day hospitalisation period, but rabies was finally excluded. During the hospitalisation period, the cat behaved normally and had no attacks of unwanted behavior. The cat was then returned to its home.\nAfter taking the cat home, the owner had to leave the pet with her partner for 3 weeks. When she returned, the symptoms of agitation/aggression and attacks had reoccurred but were more frequent and stronger. The day rhythm of the cat also changed\u2014as it was mostly agitated at night.\nVeterinary advice was sought again. Initially the cat was calm during the clinical examination, which included sampling of blood. The general condition of the cat was good. Respiration, pulse and rectal temperature were normal. The mucous membrane was pink and moist and the lymph nodes of normal size. The abdominal cavity was soft and painless on palpation and the patient showed no neurological abnormalities except for symmetrical mydriasis and scleral congestion. But during the consultation, the cat\u2019s behavior changed diametrically. Alternate periods of agitation and apathy, each lasting several minutes, occurred. During the period of agitation, the cat jumped onto furniture, intensively explored the premises, walked into objects and stepped into a water bowl. In the quiet period, the cat sat in one place staring at one point and reacted poorly to external stimuli (mainly vocal; calling by the owner).\nIn the follow-up interview it turned out, that the aggressive behaviour commenced after longer absences of the owner of at least a couple of days, when the owner\u2019s partner looked after the cat. The examining veterinarian asked the owner to contact her partner in order to identify possible causes of the medical condition of the cat. It turned out that the partner was marijuana-dependent and he admitted to have smoked marijuana while the cat\u2019s owner was absent and to have exhaled marijuana smoke directly in the cat\u2019s face \u201cas a joke\u201d.\nThe cat was given an isotonic solution of NaCl 2.5 and 2.5% glucose (Fresenius Kabi Polska Sp. z o.o., Warsaw, Poland) parenterally at a dose of 40 mL/kg/day for 2 days and was hospitalised in order to monitor the condition. During the 48-h hospitalisation, there were two periods of agitation and aggression. Sedatives were not applied as the attacks lasted less than a few minutes.\nThe blood sample underwent toxicological analysis. A screening enzyme-linked immunoassay analysis (ELISA) was used to screen for opiates, cannabinols, benzodiazepines, amphetamines and their derivatives as well as cocaine. A positive result was observed for cannabinols. Hence, further verification and quantitative tests were conducted with the use of gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) (Gas chromatograph: Aglient Technologies 6890N, Santa Clara, CA, USA; Mass spectrometer Aglient Technologies 5975B Santa Clara, CA, USA). The blood tests revealed the presence of delta-9-THC at 5.5 ng/mL, 11-hydroxy-delta-9-THC at a concentration of 1.2 ng/mL, and 11-carboxy-delta-9-THC at a concentration of 13.8 ng/mL.\nTaking into account the clinical signs as well as the result of the toxicological tests, marijuana intoxication was diagnosed as the cause of the cat\u2019s disease.

{"clinical_note": "A 55-year-old male patient, who was admitted to the local medical facility due to the sudden onset of severe headache and loss of consciousness, had a cerebellar hematoma on CT scan. He underwent an emergency placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD) on October 7, 2017. The patient was transferred to our hospital 3 days later because of high fever with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 4. Follow-up CT indicated cerebellar hemorrhage in the bilateral and 3rd ventricles (Figure ). CSF from EVD revealed a white blood cell count of 1,280 \u00d7 106/L, total protein 4.18 g/L, and glucose 2.26 mmol/L, the simultaneous blood glucose level was 7.5 mmol/L (Table ). The sputum culture tested positive for extreme-drug (EXD)-resistant A. baumannii, which was sensitive to amikacin only. Thus, pulmonary and intracranial infections were highly suspected, and vancomycin (1 g/day twice daily via IV) and amikacin (0.4 g/day twice daily via IV) were initiated empirically (October 12, 2017). During the follow-up period, the patient's fever gradually subsided. The laboratory CSF analysis improved, and the CSF cultures tested negative. However, the bacterial load further increased and the fever recurred.\nOn October 31, 2017, magnetic resonance imaging revealed hydrocephalus and interstitial edema beside bilateral ventricles. In addition, occipital horn enhancement bilaterally suggested intracranial infection (Figure ). An endoscopic ventriculostomy was done, a large amount of pus was removed from the ventricles (Figure ), and two EVDs were placed for antibiotic therapy (bilateral occipital horn; Figure ). The CSF cultures revealed an XDR strain of A. baumannii (November 6, 2017) and a minimum inhibitory tigecycline concentration of 16 \u03bcg/mL. On November 8, 2017, the patient was administered tigecycline (100 mg twice daily via IV), cefoperazone sulbactam (2 g every time, thrice daily via IV), and CVI tigecycline (10 mg/500 mL saline twice daily, in from the right occipital horn and out from the left horn). A leakage was observed around the drainage tube 4 days later. This was probably because we had to exchange the in-out tube, due to the frequent obstruction of the drainage tube or to the rather short (< 3 cm) subcutaneous tunnel of the drainage tube. Although the dressing was changed twice daily and the wound was sutured several times, the leakage persisted. Therefore, on November 14, 2017, we removed the two occipital horn drainage tubes and replaced it with two frontal horn drainage tubes with a bigger size (12#) and a longer subcutaneous tunneling (10 cm) (Figure ). Perioperative antibiotics were administered and the leakage stopped. Twelve days from the start of the CVI tigecycline, the signs of ventriculitis disappeared, and the Acinetobacter CSF load steadily decreased until CSF sterilization. Thus, we adjusted the IVT tigecycline dosage to 50 mg twice daily, whereas CVI tigecycline was adjusted to IVT tigecycline (2 mg twice daily). Tigecycline was diluted in saline up to 4 mL and was slowly injected into the lateral ventricles via EVD. After every injection, the CSF drain was temporarily closed for 2 h to prevent the untimely washout of the drug. The tigecycline treatment was well tolerated by the patient. The ventricular drainage tubes were removed, and the antibiotic therapy was discontinued after 1 week of persistent negative CSF cultures and laboratory CSF analysis (Table ). The follow-up MRI (November 27, 2017) was negative for ventriculitis (Figure ). Thus, on November 29, 2017, 14 days after the restart of the CVI tigecycline and 3 days after the IVT tigecycline, the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation unit.\nThe GCS score of the patient was 10 (E4VM5) after 2 months of follow-up, and the symptoms of intracranial infection were not observed. Repeated CSF cultures were all negative, and no radiological signs of neuro-inflammation were found.

In addition, his serum conjugated bilirubin was elevated; therefore, suspicion of an ongoing bile leak was high. On hospital day 10 after injury, the patient underwent ERCP (\n), which demonstrated a leak from one of the secondary bile ducts in the right lobe. Sphincterotomy was performed with insertion of a transampullary stent. Two days later, his ileus resolved. He was started on oral diet, antibiotics were stopped, and then he was discharged home 5 days following the ERCP and stenting.

The patient suffered a closed head injury, bilateral pulmonary contusions, and grade IV liver laceration. Because the patient was vitally stable, she was observed in the ICU. Seven days after the initial injury, the patient's abdomen became markedly distended and caused respiratory compromise requiring reintubation. Repeat computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen (\n) showed a significant amount of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. An abdominal drain was inserted under US guidance, and several liters of bloody fluid and bile were removed. Despite the drain, the patient went on to develop infected bile peritonitis (peritoneal culture grew pseudomonas aeruginosa) showing signs of severe sepsis requiring laparotomy and washout, as well as extensive abdominal drainage. Ten days after the laparotomy and 4 weeks after the initial injury, bile leak was persistent and the patient underwent ERCP (\n), which demonstrated bile leakage from a left second biliary radicle. A transampullary stent was placed. Shortly thereafter, she improved dramatically and was discharged home after a 7-week hospital stay. Bilirubin had returned to normal prior to discharge.

{"clinical_note": "A 76-year-old man originally underwent medial sectionectomy for HCC in 2009. When repeated intrahepatic recurrence occurred, he underwent RFA and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for recurrent HCC twice at segment III and once at segment IV. A 1.5-cm-diameter tumor at segment III was ablated by RFA needle twice for the first time. Four months after this treatment, a 1-cm diameter of new recurrence around the previous lesion at segment III was pointed out and ablated once by RFA needle. In 2013, the second hepatectomy for recurrent HCC at segment VIII was performed. In 2016, he had recurrent HCC at segment III around a previous RFA and TACE scar again; left lateral sectionectomy was therefore planned (Fig. ).\nThe patient had persistent infection of chronic hepatitis C and diabetes requiring insulin. Laboratory data before this operation is shown in Table . Focused on tumor markers, des-gamma carboxyprothrombin (DCP) was high while alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and lectin-reactive alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3%) were within normal limits. Liver function was good, Child-Pugh score 5A. We therefore considered these tumors to be within operative indication for left lateral sectionectomy as the third operation on the clinical diagnosis of recurrent HCC of Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM staging stage IB (T1bN0M0).\nWe planned to use ICG-NIRF system to observe the main intrahepatic metastasis at segment III and searched for other tumors in the remnant liver. Two days before the operation, 0.5 mg/kg ICG (Diagnogreen, Daiichi-Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) was intravenously injected. Photodynamic eye (PDE, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) was used as a detector of NIRF. Intraoperative gross appearance is shown in Fig. . The recurrent tumor was located at the liver surface of segment III by fluorescent signal that could be detected by NIRF system (Fig. ). There was no signal on the surface of future remnant liver (right lobe). We incidentally observed tiny signals in the right upper abdominal wall, however (Fig. ). Another fluorescent tumor was detected in the greater omentum (Fig. ). These tumors were thought to be seeding of the previous RFA, but localized and controlled. After left lateral sectionectomy, they were also resected. Fluorescent signals were observed from all tumors in each specimen, even after resection (Fig. ). Operation time was 141 min and intraoperative bleeding was 230 ml.\nHistopathological examination revealed that the main recurrent liver tumor was moderately differentiated HCC showing the progression pattern of pseudoglandular type, including the bile duct with microvascular invasion for portal vein (vp1) (Fig. ). The main tumor included both viable and necrotic areas because of the previous TACE and RFA. Both abdominal wall and greater omentum lesions were pathologically demonstrated to be metastases of HCC (Fig. ).\nThe patient was discharged from our hospital on the eighth postoperative day without any complications. There has been no further recurrence 14 months after the operation.\nIn this study, we incidentally detected implanted and disseminated needle tract and peritoneal seeding from previous RFA by intraoperative NIRF imaging system. Detection of intrahepatic HCC was reported by Gotoh et al. [] and Ishizawa et al. []. There are several reports about HCC detection using ICG-NIRF system [, ]. Moreover, this system could also be used to detect extrahepatic HCC lesions, such as in the appendix [], lymph node, lungs, peritoneum, and adrenal glands []. The detailed mechanism of how extrahepatic tumor cells uptake ICG and emit fluorescence remains unclear. Satou et al. hypothesized that the extrahepatic HCC cells themselves also possess the capability to take up ICG from the blood stream. The absence of other adjacent cells or vessels, including the biliary system, may have caused the ICG retention in the metastatic lesions []. Further pathological examination is needed to understand this phenomenon.\nThis patient underwent repeated RFA for recurrent HCC. Percutaneous procedures have a risk of needle tract implantation, and peritoneal seeding and frequency of these complications are reported as between 0.9 and 12.5% [, \u2013]. Llovet et al. indicated risk factors for complications include subcapsular lesions, use of cool-tip-type electrode needles, poorly differentiated HCC, and high levels of alpha-fetoprotein.\nEfficacy of resection for needle tract implantation was suggested by Noda et al. []. One-year survival rate was 85% for patients who underwent resection of extrahepatic lesions, according to Satou et al. []. Operative indications are generally restricted to selective patients, however []. Time intervals between RFA and diagnosis of needle tract implantation were between 3 weeks and 48 months []; the mean doubling time was 112 (range 22\u2013415) days []. ICG-NIRF system might be useful for the removal of these lesions during the operation for RFA treatment.\nICG-NIRF system has some limitations, however. The system is restricted to detection of fluorescence for tumors 5\u201310 mm from the liver surface [, ]. There were also false-positive results for liver cysts and dysplastic tumors in severe liver cirrhosis []. In the detection of extrahepatic lesions, however, there are no such limitations. This system might be helpful in the detection of needle tract implantations or peritoneal seeding.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}

Her past medical, social, environmental, and family history was not appreciable. She was 147 cm tall, and her weight was 40 kg. She had a Cobb angle of 60 degrees. She had no neurological symptoms. Her temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C, her blood pressure was 118/64 mmHg, and her pulse was 92 beats per minute. Laboratory findings at admission were as follows. Her white blood cell count was 6860/\u03bcl, red blood cell count 472 \u00d7 104/\u03bcl, hemoglobin 14.3 g/dl, hematocrit 42.1%, platelets 30.8 \u00d7 104/\u03bcl, aspartate transaminase 19 IU/L, alanine transaminase 15 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dl, \u03b3-glutamyl transferase 16 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 371 IU/L, total protein 8.2 g/dl, albumin 5.2 g/dl, blood urea nitrogen 11 mg/dl, creatinine 0.39 mg/dl, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, C-reactive protein 0.01 mg/dl, urinalysis pH 6.0, no uric protein, no urinary sugar, no ketone body, and no uric blood. No microbial examination was performed.\nWe planned general anesthesia using a target-controlled infusion of propofol and a continuous infusion of remifentanil to record MEPs and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs). In addition, we planned to use both bolus and continuous infusions of ketamine, followed by intravenous patient-controlled fentanyl as postoperative analgesia because we believed that ketamine did not affect MEP monitoring.\nAfter securing an intravenous line in the patient\u2019s forearm, general anesthesia was induced using a target-controlled infusion of propofol 4 \u03bcg/ml and remifentanil 0.3 \u03bcg/kg/minute. After administration of rocuronium 20 mg, the trachea was intubated using a reinforced endotracheal tube. Thereafter, 1 g of cefazolin sodium was administered intravenously every 3 hours during the surgery and every 12 hours until postoperative day 1.\nWe started preparation for recording the MEPs and SSEPs. MEPs were evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation (a train of five pulses with an interstimulus interval of 2 milliseconds; supramaximal stimulus, 400 V) with screw electrodes fixed at 2 cm anterior to C3 and C4 (cathode and anode, respectively, following the international 10\u201320 system). MEPs and SSEPs were recorded using an intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring system (Neuromaster MEE-1216; Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan). MEPs were recorded bilaterally from the abductor pollicis, quadriceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and flexor hallucis brevis muscles. SSEPs were evoked by stimulation (30 mA) of the sciatic nerve and recorded from 2 cm posterior to Cz (averaging the signals generated by 200 stimulations).\nAfter the patient was turned to a prone position, we confirmed that we could record MEPs from all targeted muscles without difficulty. We maintained general anesthesia using a target-controlled infusion of propofol 3.3 \u03bcg/ml and remifentanil 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/minute. The patient\u2019s bispectral index values were below 60, and her vital signs were stable. Several minutes before the skin incision was made, the attending anesthesiologist evaluating the MEPs discovered that they were markedly attenuated (Fig. ).

About 6 minutes after administration of ketamine, the MEP amplitudes were recovered.\nThe surgery was performed uneventfully, and the patient had no neurologic deficit when she emerged from general anesthesia. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (a combination of fentanyl 25 \u03bcg/ml and ketamine 2.5 mg/ml, background infusion 1 ml/hour, bolus 1 ml, and lockout time 10 minutes) was used for postoperative pain management.

There were no masses, hydronephrosis, or hydroureter. A urinalysis revealed the following: specific gravity = 1.010; pH = 7.0; leukocyte esterase = 500; trace microscopic hematuria; and negative nitrite. The urine culture was negative. The uric acid level in blood was 2.9 mg/dL (Normal range: 2.5\u20138.5 mg/dL). Uric acid levels in blood collected in the previous 2 years were all in the normal range, specifically, 5.0 mg/dL, 2.6 mg/dL, and 3.2 mg/dL. There was no evidence of renal failure. The patient underwent six separate urinalyses between the ages of 9 and 12, all of which demonstrated a pH of either 6 or 7.\nA CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated staghorn calculi in both kidneys, involving all calyces.\nThe patient underwent a right percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) 2 months after presentation. During the hospital stay, the patient was noted to be anemic and received 5 days of epogen and iron supplementation. He developed a thrombus in the right cephalic vein and was diagnosed with heterozygous Factor V Leiden with elevated homocysteine (16.2 umol/L [Normal range: 6.6\u201314.8 umol/L]). The methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and prothrombin genes were negative. Folic acid was initiated. The Factor V Leiden mutation was detected through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that utilized microarray-based oligonucleotide hybridization and signal amplification to detect the Factor V Leiden mutation.\nSeven weeks later, the patient began experiencing aspiration of liquids, gastroesophageal reflux, and markedly delayed gastric emptying, necessitating a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with gastrostomy tube and open pyloroplasty.

There had been progressive growth and multiple drainage attempts due to a suspected abscess at various referral sites without relief. He was given non-oncological surgical resection in another institution, and his pathology report was compatible with high-grade sarcoma with positive margins. Additionally, he referred to bilateral vision loss that had been evolving for one month. The initial clinical exam revealed a patient with normal vital signs who was disoriented with regard to space and time though awake and had poor communication with the examiner. He presented a hyperpigmented tumor measuring 10 x 8 cm in the back region, along with a scarred postsurgical lesion without inflammatory signs. The biopsy was reviewed by the INC Pathology Department, which indicated a high-grade sarcoma compatible with myxofibrosarcoma.\nHe was examined by the Ophthalmology Department, which considered bilateral retinal detachment probable. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed a diffuse density alteration of the subcutaneous cellular tissue, without evidence of lesions, probably due to edema. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast showed an undefined heterogeneous mass dependent on the soft tissues in the posterior thorax wall, with infiltration signs in the muscular plane and the density alteration of the subcutaneous cellular tissue and skin (See Figure ). He was examined by clinical oncology, surgical oncology, and radiation oncology services, which indicated he was not a candidate for chemotherapy, surgical treatment, or radiotherapy because of the significant extension of the tumor into the upper and lower back, the inadequate response of these tumors to chemotherapy, and the patient\u2019s poor Zubrod performance score.\nDuring inpatient care, the patient showed substantial clinical worsening characterized by the progressive deterioration of his consciousness state and persistent oral cavity bleeding. Laboratory tests were requested, which showed the prolongation of blood clotting time due to extended partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with the test value for prothrombin time (PT) being 11.9 seconds and that for PTT being 50.1 seconds (normal value until 28 seconds). The mixing study showed PTT fixing with a 50:50 normal plasma sample that lasted for the first and second hour, suggesting intrinsic pathway coagulation factor deficiency. Even though the mixing study was not suggestive of the presence of inhibitors, the medical history of the patient, the presence of an active neoplasm, and the recent beginning of bleeding created a clinical suspicion of acquired hemophilia. For these reasons, a new mixing study, VIII factor assay, and Bethesda assay to measure factor VIII inhibitors were requested. In addition, treatment with prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day and factor VIII at 1700 international unit (IU) every 12 hours was initiated. The results of these assays showed a basal PTT of 67 seconds, which with the 50:50 sample with normal plasma, was reduced to 38,2 seconds and maintained at around normal values two hours afterwards, with a value of 36,3 seconds. Factor VIII was measured at 4% and remained at this same value (4%) 10 minutes after the injection of intravenous factor VIII. The specific factor VIII inhibitor assay reported 1.6 Bethesda units. A diagnosis of acquired hemophilia was made based on the presence of hidden low-titer inhibitors in the mixing study.\nBased on the findings above, the persistence of oral cavity bleeding, and daily transfusion support in the form of two red blood cell units, IV treatment with an activated prothrombin complex like the factor eight (VIII) inhibitor bypassing activity (FEIBA) at a dose of 3500 units/12 h (50 U/kg every 12 hours) was initiated. During the patient\u2019s evolution, hypofibrinogenemia development, the continuous elevation of D-dimer levels, and progressive thrombocytopenia suggested a diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Because of the unresolved bleeding, it was decided to initiate a transfusion of cryoprecipitate and tranexamic acid oral rinse while augmenting the FEIBA dose. The patient developed a low response to the established treatment, along with more profound neurological impairment (central nervous system bleeding was ruled out) and the persistence of red blood cell, platelet, and cryoprecipitate transfusion requirements. Additionally, the patient had severe hyponatremia in the form of an electrolyte imbalance. Electrolyte correction was initiated, and because of the persistence of bleeding, oral cyclophosphamide was added to the immunosuppressive treatment, with the objective of eradicating the inhibitors. Seven days afterward, because of the lack of clinical response to management and the impossibility of providing specific antineoplastic treatment, with the agreement of the patient\u00b4s family, transfusion support was suspended, and palliative care was initiated. The patient died one week after.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 41-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of hepatitis C, hemiplegic migraine, and diverticulitis. He was well until 2011 when he first developed a severe headache followed by right-hand weakness and numbness. He was taken to the hospital where a diagnosis of hemipalegic migraine was made. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed some white matter changes thought to be secondary to hemiplegic migraine at that time. He recovered complete neurological function with no residual deficits.\nOn this admission, the patient initially presented to the hospital with right-sided facial droop and weakness in the right lower extremity. The initial computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain was negative for acute bleed. An MRI of the brain was ordered because the patient continued to experience focal neurological deficits including right arm weakness, dysarthria, and decreased cognitive function on neurological examination and neuropsychiatric testing. At this point, it was thought that he had suffered an ischemic stroke, and the MRI showed multiple areas of restricted diffusion suggestive of embolic disease (Figure ). These findings called into question the diagnosis of hemiplegic migraine.\nThe patient received aspirin after ruling out active bleeding on non-contrast CT of the head. The search for an embolic source included a CT-angiograph of the neck which did not reveal carotid stenosis. He then had a transthoracic echocardiograph and a trans esophageal echocardiograph both of which were unremarkable. The differential diagnosis at that time included transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, brain tumors, central nervous system (CNS) infection, CNS vasculitis, inherited disorders including mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), CADASIL, and hereditary telangiectasia. A lumbar puncture was performed for possible meningitis. The cytology was negative and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was not suggestive of meningitis, neurosyphilis, or Lyme disease. Lyme serology, the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) blood tests were all negative. The CSF was also screened for possible multiple sclerosis, but no oligoclonal bands were detected. At this point, there was a concern for possible vasculitis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. Genetic testing for CADASIL was ordered, but the sample had to be sent out to a lab equipped to perform the genetic test and would take several weeks to return. He was placed on a five-day course of intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone which improved his neurological symptoms. Following completion of his steroid course, it was decided that an alternative to angiogram would be brain biopsy to look for CNS vasculitis. The patient and his family were eager to have an established diagnosis by the end of the hospital course, and the differential diagnosis included CNS vasculitis for which brain biopsy would provide valuable diagnostic information. Given the recent advances in imaging and neurosurgical techniques, the complication rate for routine biopsy has been reduced significantly. The patient elected to have the procedure performed. Rheumatology was consulted and an angiogram was recommended as well to rule out CNS vasculitis or vasospasm as a possible cause for the strokes. The patient had physical therapy and his motor and cognitive function gradually improved over the course of his hospital stay. The patient was accepted into a neurological rehabilitation facility and discharged on oral steroids. The results of the brain biopsy confirmed CADASIL after the patient was discharged to the rehabilitation facility. The results of the genetic tests for mutations in the NOTCH3 gene provided further confirmation with a sensitivity approaching 100%.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

{"clinical_note": "A 44-year-old previously healthy Asian female reported to the neurology clinic with complaints of episodic, persistent, uncomfortable needle-like sensations in her genitalia extending to the anal area and the tip of the coccyx. She had been suffering from these symptoms for approximately 11 years. She had difficulty describing the actual nature of this phenomenon, which, according to her, was more of an irritation and discomfort than actual pain. The discomfort was aggravated during rest and periods of inactivity, particularly at night. It responded briefly to mefenamic acid tablets for four to five hours. She also reported the pain was worse before her monthly menstrual cycle but that sexual activity did not affect her discomfort. Sometimes, the discomfort was intense and would wake her from sleep causing severe discomfort and resulting in difficulty sitting; walking would relieve her symptoms partially. She was better in the morning, but the symptoms appeared again at end of the day. She had multiple gynecology and dermatology consults with no relief or clear diagnosis. She was prescribed antifungal creams, including fluconazole and ketoconazole, topical steroids (betamethasone and hydrocortisone), and mefenamic acid for pain relief. All failed to bring relief. She also consulted a homeopathy practitioner, who labeled her as suffering from a chronic skin disease and prescribed oral and topical medication. She took it for a few months but stopped it due to lack of relief. Ultimately, due to the distress and anguish associated with the condition, lack of response to various treatments, and social embarrassment, she stopped visiting doctors for some time. However, during a recent visit, the consulting gynecologist suspected it was not a dermatological or gynecological problem and referred her for a neurology consult.\nThere was no history of back pain, sensory symptoms in the legs, urinary incontinence, or neurological disorder, such as Parkinsonism or restless leg disorder. She had a stable and happy marital life of 22 years and had three children. She has used no substance of abuse or recreational drugs. Her neurological and gynecological examinations, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, were normal (Figure ). Similarly, her biochemical profile (including complete blood count, urine analysis, serum urea, and creatinine) and an ultrasound examination of abdomen and pelvis were normal.\nConsidering her history of circadian rhythm variations in symptoms and aggravation on rest, RGS was considered the most likely cause of her symptoms. After a detailed discussion with the patient, she was prescribed 0.5 mg of ropinirole once at night. It was increased to twice daily after seven days, to which she responded well and reported a dramatic relief of symptoms after 14 days. The dose was increased to 1 mg in the morning and 0.5 mg at night, which led to further improvement. On her third follow-up after two months, she reported taking her medication regularly, which led to almost no episodes of discomfort, with exception of one or two times. The dose of ropinirole was maintained for one month. At the three-month follow-up, she reported only one episode of pain and itching, when she missed one dose of her medicine for a few days; otherwise, she had no complaints and reported no side effects of the medication.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}

The patient first noticed a \u201cknot\u201d on his foot between the second and third toes approximately one year ago. The patient was referred to the orthopaedics foot and ankle clinic for further evaluation. The patient reported his pain as neuropathic and paresthetic, and radiating to the second interdigital space. His symptoms were worsened by walking, standing, and climbing ladders and stairs. The patient had a known history of gout and was currently being treated with allopurinol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Despite treatment with urate-lowering medication, the patient exhibited tophaceous lesions of various sizes on his left elbow, right knee, right foot and bilateral hands, all asymptomatic.\nUpon evaluation, the patient was afebrile; the other vital signs were within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient had pain with palpation of the interspace between the second and third metatarsal heads, with no metatarsal-phalangeal instability or hyperkeratosis. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nX-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were ordered to supplement the physical examination. The anterior-posterior and lateral foot X-rays showed small periarticular erosions in the second metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, consistent with crystal-induced arthropathy, with no significant degenerative change, fracture, or dislocation (Figure ). The MRI study showed a well-circumscribed, heterogeneous, soft tissue mass overlying the dorsal aspect of the second MTP joint, containing multiple internal cystic areas. The lesion was measured approximately 4.1 x 2.7 x 2.6 cm, based upon coronal, sagittal and axial T1 images (Figure ). There was an extensive erosion of the second metatarsal head with associated cortical destruction. The patient\u2019s serum uric acid level was 6.2 mg/dL (normal range 4.0-8.5 mg/dL).\nThe patient was consented for an excisional biopsy of the lesion and decompression of the second intermetatarsal space. The procedure started with a dorsal incision over the second intermetatarsal space. The skin was sharply dissected and the subcutaneous tissue bluntly dissected. Keeping the neurovascular structures protected, the deep tissue was completely exposed. The pseudotumoral lesion was visualized as granular, opaque and whitish, located within the second intermetatarsal space, with no involvement of the adjacent soft tissue. The lesion was excised and removed completely, measured as 2.5 x 1.6 x 1.0 cm, and sent to pathology.\nNext, attention was made toward decompression of the intermetatarsal space. The intermetatarsal ligament was identified and resected while protecting the nerve underneath. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications, and was discharged the same day with postoperative pain management medication. Postoperative instructions were to partially bear weight with a wedged shoe for two weeks, then progressively increase weight bearing as tolerated, and return to normal activities and normal shoe wear after six weeks. The patient's postoperative follow-ups were in two weeks for wound check and suture removal in six weeks and three months.\nThe surgical pathology report confirmed the lesion was a gouty tophus.

This was described as a dull \u201cliver pain\u201d in the right upper quadrant area. On physical exam, there was evidence of a midline scar, the abdomen was soft with mild tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant and the liver span was approximately 10 cm in the mid-clavicular line by percussion. A complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel were normal; however, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) showed a mild elevation of 66 U/L and 51 U/L, respectively. Serum bilirubin levels and alkaline phosphatase levels were within normal limits. Due to the reported complaint of right upper quadrant pain and the associated abnormal liver function tests, an abdominal ultrasound (US) was ordered. This showed fatty liver disease and a left liver lobe isoechoic liver mass. A computed tomography (CT) triple phase abdomen scan was done demonstrating a 2.5 cm exophytic mass in the liver in segment 2 (Figure ). The next day of admission, the patient\u2019s pain improved with analgesia. As no clear diagnosis was made, he was later discharged with an intention to perform an elective abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This MRI revealed a single mass in segment 2 of the liver, with features of a hepatic adenoma (Figure ). The surgical team was consulted and evaluated the patient and an elective percutaneous liver biopsy was performed. Examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections revealed histological evidence of splenic tissue with distinct red and white pulp areas, with evidence of passive congestion (Figure ). The red pulp included thin-walled venous sinusoids that were congested with red blood cells that were positive for CD8 stains (Figure ), with surrounding macrophages and few lymphocytes. The white pulp included thickened meshwork of cords showing arterioles sheathed by predominantly small T lymphocytes (CD3+) and scattered B-cell aggregates (CD20+), consistent with splenic Malpighian corpuscles (Figure ). On further questioning, the patient reported he had an exploratory laparotomy with subsequent emergent splenectomy at the age of 16 years due to a motor vehicle accident which caused a splenic rupture.

The history of present illness revealed that the patient had noticed the swelling in the last few weeks and it also had an associated intraoral ulcer. The patient was a known diabetic who was under medication. He had a habit of smoking cigarettes for the past 15 years. He smoked almost 15 cigarettes per day. The clinical examination revealed a firm swelling in the left zygomatic region measuring approximately 3 cm to 5 cm. It was mildly painful on palpation. The left maxillary region had significant paresthesia, nasal obstruction, and episodes of pain. A palpable left submandibular lymph node was present, which was also tender and fixed. The cervical lymph node on the left side was also palpable (Figure ). The intraoral examination revealed an ulceroproliferative growth measuring 4 cm to 6 cm in dimension.\nThe lesion was extending in relation to teeth 23, 24, and 25. The ulcer was covered with necrotic slough. Purulent discharge and bleeding were present in the lesion. The other teeth in the quadrant were missing (Figure ). A panoramic radiograph revealed extruded teeth 23, 24, 25.\nThere was increased radiopacity in the left maxillary sinus (Figure ). Water\u2019s view showed the opacification of the entire left maxillary sinus.\nAn intraoral extension of this mass was also evident. The inferior, posterior, lateral, and medial walls of the left maxillary sinus appeared to be destroyed (Figure ). A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a lesion extending into the maxillary space and the nasal cavity. A heterodense soft tissue lesion showing heterogeneous contrast enhancement in the left maxillary sinus and hard palate with the destruction of the posterolateral wall, medial wall, and floor of the left maxillary antrum, extending into the adjacent retro maxillary space and medially extending into the left nasal cavity, obliterating all meati with the destruction of nasal turbinates. It was also inferiorly extending into the oral cavity. The CT was suggestive of carcinoma antrum. The CT was sufficient to understand the extensions of the lesions and the destruction of nasal turbinates. Further radiological investigations were, hence, not considered.\nConsidering the patient history and clinical features and the fact that patient was experiencing paresthesia, a biopsy was deemed mandatory (Figure ). On microscopic examination, the given hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained soft tissue section showed dysplastic epithelial islands arranged in sheets and nests, invading fibrovascular stroma.\nAs shown in Figure , the dysplastic epithelial cells exhibited an increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, individual cell keratinization, and increased mitotic figures.\nKeratin pearl formation was also evident, suggestive of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

The patient attributed his headache to possible mold exposure in his apartment or recent smoking cessation. He did not initially have signs or endorse symptoms concerning for the life-threatening etiology of his headache, to include mass, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), or infection []. The initial differential diagnosis was broad, but the etiology appeared to be benign. The patient subsequently had improvement with metoclopramide and diphenhydramine. Laboratory studies and head computed tomography (CT) without contrast were ordered at triage. The reason they were ordered is unclear, as there were no clear red flags on presentation. The patient had a WBC count of 773,000 (801,000 on repeat laboratory draw) with a basophilic predominance (51%). Concern shifted to leukemia as the likely etiology of headache, with potentially a blast crisis causing leukostasis. Ophthalmology and hematology/oncology were consulted. On repeat history after laboratory studies, the patient endorsed multiple episodes of intermittent complete loss of vision lasting several seconds over the preceding few weeks, as well as recent night sweats and unintentional weight loss. Peripheral smear showed 9% blasts and had findings consistent with chronic CML, including basophilic predominance. Ophthalmologic examination demonstrated gross papilledema and retinal hemorrhage bilaterally, with a serous elevation of the right retina and turbid white cells below (Figures -). The ophthalmologic findings were consistent with a head CT without contrast that was concerning for elevated ICP.\nLeukocytapheresis, or white blood cell removal, was considered due to the degree of hyperleukocytosis.

She was subsequently treated with a left below knee amputation and L3 corpectomy with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation from L1 to L5 with decompression laminectomy at L2-3, and L3-4 through a posterior and left thoracoabdominal approach in March 2016 ().\nShe was found to have an abnormal bone scan with a lesion at the L3 level 3 months after completing chemotherapy in November 2016. MRI scan and ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of right paraspinal psoas tissue confirmed recurrent osteoblastic osteosarcoma on December 2016 (). On physical examination, she was able to ambulate with use of a below knee prosthesis and demonstrated no neurological deficits. The patient was started on second line drugs, including two cycles of ifosfamide/etoposide. Previous implants were well in place. Imaging was performed with radiographs, CT scan, bone scan, PET scan, and MRI scan with contrast enhancement to confirm only a single metastatic site (). For therapeutic strategy determination, the patient was introduced to our local tumor board. Preoperative workup was completed, and surgery was planned for a complex en bloc resection of L2, L3, and L4 with removal of deep spinal implants with anterior and posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation (). The option of nonoperative palliative care was offered to the patient and her family, but they elected to proceed with en bloc resection to maximize her chances of survival, in spite of high surgical risk and an overall poor prognosis. They were informed preoperatively that a complete resection would require sacrificing her nerve roots at L2, L3 and L4. A palliative decompression was not offered for the revision procedure as a treatment option as the patient was not complaining of pain or neurological symptoms, and it would not have improved her life expectancy.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "An 80-year-old lady suffered a comminuted intratrochanteric fracture following a mechanical fall, with an AO classification of 3.1A2.3. After we excluded all contraindications, drew up a series of preoperation plans, consist of measure medullary cavity diameter, anterior femoral arch angle and the optimal entry point and so on. We treated with satisfied close reduction with traction on a traction operating table, and then captured the best point to insert the guide needle (). In sequence, reamed medullary cavity was performed step-by-step. Unfortunately, the reamer was stuck into femoral medullary cavity tightly at last, we could not move out by traction or rotation. What's the worst, the reamer head was ruptured completely finally, and remained in femoral shaft isolated (). The broken reamer located much more distal to the femoral intertrochanteric fracture site and jammed with cortex of bone firmly. So an extreme tough challenge for removal was in front of us.\nThe guide needle was removed easily, on account of less experience to refer, and no instrument to use. Therefore we performed an open technique and created a 2.0 cm \u00d70.4 cm long strip bony window by using an osteotome, which is just right for inserting a bone detacher, then put the detacher head adjoin the reamer, we moved out the broken reamer head by knocking back the inserted detacher and pulling out through the medullary cavity using a Kocher's clamp (). A set of PFNA was inserted to fixation and the bony window was full with bony bar taken down before, and the fracture got a good bone union after 2 months ().", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 47-year-old woman was referred with a 6-month history of a right anterior chest mass. A physical examination showed a palpable firm mass with tenderness in the right anterior chest. Her routine laboratory investigations were within the biological reference range. Enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) showed a dumbbell-shaped mass with calcification, and its anterior portion was located under the pectoralis minor muscle and the posterior portion projected to the thoracic cavity (Fig. a). Chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an invasive tumor, which was isointense on T1-weighted images and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images (Fig. ). Aspiration biopsy cytology performed by a previous physician had shown malignancy, and no evidence of distant metastasis was found. Therefore, we planned surgical resection of the tumor with chest reconstruction. The patient was placed in the supine position. We first examined inside the thoracic cavity with thoracoscopy through the seventh intercostal space and found no lung invasion of the tumor. Wide resection, including the middle part of the pectoralis major muscle, the pectoralis minor muscle, and the third and fourth ribs, was performed. A negative margin of the tumor was identified by frozen sections. We used a 2-mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) patch (Gore Dualmesh; W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) for chest wall reconstruction and covered it with spared skin and breast (Fig. ). The operation time was 3 h and 33 min, and intraoperative blood loss was 64 ml.\nThe resected specimen was a firm tumor that surrounded the third rib (7.5 cm) (Fig. ). Microscopically, the tumor cells showed an epithelioid appearance with cytoplasmic eosinophilia. The epithelioid cells had large vesicular nuclei and were arranged in sheet-like pattern. In some locations, scattered microcalcification was observed (Fig. a, b). Immunohistochemical staining showed expression of CD34 and cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) (Fig. c, d), but no expression of CD31, Sox10, Stat6, and integrase interactor 1 (INI1) in tumor cells. The diagnosis was proximal-type ES in the right chest wall. The French F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre Le Cancer grading system was grade 2.\nWe started physical therapy on postoperative day 6 for local pain and limitation of shoulder motion. These symptoms improved by physical therapy, and she was discharged on postoperative day 18. Although weakness of the arm and chronic pain had been persistent, she could be reinstated in former factory work. We did not perform postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

{"clinical_note": "A 21 year old female presented to gynecology out patient department with complaints of inability to concieve for the last 5 years. Her menstrual history was within normal limits except for the last 5 months whe she developed irregular menstrual bleeding and dysmennorhea. There was no history of any chronic illness like tuberculosis in the past. She had undergone appendicectomy 11 years back for acute appendicitis. On general physical examination she had pallor and mild pedal edema. On per abdomen examination there was a lump in abdomen measuring approximately 8 X 8 centimeters in the left iliac fossa. Her per vaginum examination revealed bilateral tender fornices and a bulky uterus while per speculum examination showed healthy vagina and cervix.\nPatient was further investigated and on Ultrasonography was found to have left sided ovarian cyst measuring 5 X 4 cm, diagnosed as a complex cyst with septations. Uterus was found to be anteverted, bulky and with multiple fibroids both on anterior and posterior walls. Kidney also showed hydronephrotic changes. On Hysterosalpingography, bilateral tubes were blocked. Laparotomy was perfomed which revealed a large tubo-ovarian mass on left side measuring 6 X 7 cm. Omentum and bowel were found to be adherent to this mass. Along with a large 5 X 2 cm fibroid found in anterior wall of uterus. Right sided falllopian tube was tortuous and edematous while right ovary was apparently normal. So a Left salpingo ophrectomy was performed and sent for histopathological examination. Pus drained from omentum was sent for culture and sensitivity. However it did not reveal any growth (including Mycobacterium tuberculosis) even after 4 weeks .Other investigation of the patient revealed CA 125 levels to be 246 U/ml and serum LH levels to be 7.58mIU/ml. Thyroid profile was normal.\nWe received a mutilated specimen in three pieces. The largest piece measured 5\u00d73\u00d72 cm. Outer surface was exudate covered and congested. Cut surface revealed red brown areas with a luminal structure likely to be tube. Second and third pieces were measuring 4\u00d73\u00d71 cm and 1\u00d71\u00d70.5 cm. Sections from the ovary showed sheets of foamy histiocytes along with the presence of inflammatory infiltrates in the form of lymphocytes, plasma cells and some neutrophils and eosinophils. There were fair number of foamy histiocytes with abundant lipid laden vacoules in the cytoplasm and hypochromatic nuclei. There was fibrosis along with some vascular proliferation in the ovarian parenchyma. Sections from fallopian tubes also showed the presence of xanthogranulomatous inflammation in the lamina propria and the serosa of the tube walls (as shown in ). Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) and Acid fast stains were negative. Subsequent immunohistochemical stains demostrated positive CD68, CD 3 snd CD 20 were suggestive of a mixed inlflammatory infilterates in both tube and ovary.

{"clinical_note": "A 10-year-old girl was referred to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Fudan University because of polydipsia and polyuria. She was born to non-consanguineous healthy parents of Chinese Han ethnicity and good socioeconomic status. She was the only child of the family, and there was no family history of FS. Newborn hearing screening failed. There was no history of birth defects. She was not receiving any medication and did not take alcohol or smoke tobacco. She was in Grade 4 of primary school and was not good at studying.\nAt 3 months of age, she presented with jaundice, hepatomegaly (3.5 cm below the costal margin), and splenomegaly (4 cm below the costal margin). She was admitted to our hospital. Laboratory findings revealed: elevation of direct bilirubin (DB), that is, total bilirubin (TB) 66.1 \u03bcmol/L (normal range, 0\u20136 \u03bcmol/L) and DB 61.4 \u03bcmol/L (normal range, 5.1\u201317.6 \u03bcmol/L); and almost normal transaminases, that is, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 24 IU/L (normal range, 0\u201340 IU/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 46 IU/L (normal range, 0\u201340 IU/L)). Laboratory tests for hepatotropic viruses were negative. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography excluded bile duct obstruction. After treatment with ursodiol, the jaundice resolved gradually. During the follow-up years, her liver functions were normal. Hypoglycemia was initially noticed during hospitalization, and fasting blood glucose ranged from 1.4 to 2.8 mmol/l. Prior to this, there was no record of a hypoglycemic episode. At the time of hypoglycemia (blood glucose 1.4 mmol/l), an inappropriate glycemic response to glucagon (increase of 4.3 mmol/l) was consistent with excess insulin action, confirming hyperinsulinism. Frequent feeding combined with intravenously administered glucose (6\u20137 mg/kg per minute) was required to maintain normoglycemia. She was discharged from the nursery with stable glucose levels (4.3\u20136.5 mmol/l) on the condition of frequent feeds. At 1 year of age, she experienced an episode of hypoglycemia, and the symptoms resolved after feeding. Subsequently, no symptoms of hypoglycemia appeared again.\nShort stature was noticed (height and weight were below the third percentile) by routine physical examination at the age of 5. Laboratory investigations revealed proteinuria and glycosuria, mild acidosis, and hypophosphatemic rickets. Prior to this, she had recurrent urinary tract infections, suggesting an earlier onset of abnormal urine. Based on the clinical impression of FS, she was treated with calcitriol, phosphorus, and potassium citrate. Over the ensuing years, sodium citrate and other medications were used to maintain acid-base balance, but there was no improvement in her short stature, and her serum creatinine remained elevated by age 10.\nAt 10 years of age, she was admitted to our clinic because of symptoms of FS and elevated serum creatinine: 75 \u03bcmol/L (normal range, 21\u201365 \u03bcmol/L). On this admission, her height was 126.5 cm (below the third percentile) and her weight was 28 kg (25th percentile). Laboratory investigations revealed: renal glycosuria in the absence of hyperglycemia; proteinuria with a urinary protein to creatinine ratio (pro/Cr) of 2.17 (normal range, 0\u20130.2); hypercalciuria with a urinary calcium to creatinine ratio (U-Ca/Cr) of 0.31 (normal range, < 0.21); and hypouricemia with 66 \u03bcmol/L (normal range, 90\u2013420 \u03bcmol/l).

{"clinical_note": "In Mar 2013, a 33-year-old female came to the nephrology department because of 4 years of recurrent acute pyelonephritis. She had no other notable past medical history including polyuria, polydipsia, muscular cramps, carpopedal spasms or generalized seizures, and did not take any regular medication. Her parents, who aged 56 and 53 respectively, were second cousins and denied any remarkable medical history. Her only sibling died from renal failure without definite cause at age 25. The pedigree of the family is shown in Fig. . Physical examination revealed that her height was 160 cm (The average height of Chinese adult females at corresponding age is 159 cm.) and her weight was 55 kg with a BMI of 21.48 kg/m2. Laboratory workup revealed impaired renal function (SCr 250 \u03bcmol/L, EPI-eGFR = 21.1 ml/min/1.73m2), hypocalcemia (1.42 mmol/l, normal range 2.11\u20132.52), and normal serum parathyroid hormone levels (65.59 pg/ml) in the context of normal 25OH-Vitamin D levels (26 ng/ml, reference range 20.0\u201332.0) (Table ). Her serum magnesium level was slightly low (0.60 mmol/l, reference range 0.65\u20131.20), and 24-h urinary calcium was 3.9 mmol/1.73m2 (normal range 2.5\u20135.5) in the setting of decreased renal function. Distal renal tubular acidosis was excluded since she had normal urine acidification function (pH < 5.3) in the setting of nearly normal serum bicarbonate level (HCO3\u2212 22 mmol/l). Renal ultrasound imaging demonstrated bilateral nephrocalcinosis and parenchymal renal calculi, with the right kidney length 9.5 cm and the left 9.4 cm. Ophthalmologic examination was normal. During the subsequent 3 years of follow-up, she had undergone six attacks of acute UPI. In the interictal phase of infections, she had accepted four times of biochemical assessment (Table ). Repeated examinations in the follow-up revealed marked renal loss of magnesium (fractional excretion 42.7 \u00b1 7.4%, normal range less than 5%) and hypercalciuria (urinary calcium/creatine 0.52 \u00b1 0.08 mol/mol, normal range 0.15\u20130.33). Treatment with calcitriol and calcium but not with magnesium was difficult to achieve a considerable effect on her serum calcium, whereas her serum magnesium concentration fluctuated within the normal range (0.70\u20130.91 mmol/l) under the circumstances of renal failure. Plain abdominal radiograph and abdominal CT scanning, which were performed in Mar 2014 and Feb 2016 respectively, demonstrated gradually aggravated nephrocalcinosis and atrophy of renal parenchyma (Fig. ). In the end, the patient unavoidably reached ESRD at the age of 36. The gradient of GFR decline was calculated to be 4.3 ml/min per 1.73 m2/yr. during the follow up, whereas the gradient of GFR decline was about 2.1 ml/min per 1.73 m2/yr. 3 years before the period of follow up, and the approved global slope of decline was 2.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2/yr.\nNephrocalcinosis associated with end-stage renal failure is usually seen in three genetic diseases: primary hyperoxaluria, Dent\u2019s disease, and FHHNC. Meanwhile, hypercalciuric hypomagnesemia is mainly seen in FHHNC, autosomal dominant hypocalcemia with hypercalciuria (CASR gain-of-function), or Bartter syndrome type III. Although the patient\u2019s family history, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia suggested FHHNC, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) to exclude the possibilities of comorbid diseases or potential mutations of other genes that could affect the renal reabsorption of calcium and magnesium. All the family members and healthy controls gave informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Studies at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. As a result, a homozygous cytosine-to-guanine substitution at position 346 of the open reading frame (c.346C > G) in exon 2 of CLDN16 gene was identified by WES. This single nucleotide alteration led to a single amino acid substitution from leucine to valine at amino acid position 116 of claudin 16 (p.Leu116Val; Of note, there is still controversy about the physiological use of the initiation codon. The numbering of the mutation regarded to the second ATG would be p.Leu46Val.) (Fig. ). Sanger sequencing validation of all family members revealed that four of her unaffected members including her parents, grandmother and one of her cousins carried heterozygous p.Leu116Val mutation in CLDN16, whereas other family members and 200 unrelated controls from the same ethnic background (Chinese Han population) did not carry this mutation. This novel variant was highly conserved among 8 different species (Human, Rat, Frog, Chimpanzee, Eagle, Horse, Turtle & Cattle) (Additional file : Figure S2) and among all 27 Human Claudins family members, and never been reported in 1000G, ExAC, or EVS. All four in silico prediction tools (SIFT, PolyPhen2, Mutation taster, and PROVEAN) showed a possibility of disease-causing for FHHNC. In addition, analysis by HSF 3.0 () software showed that no significant alteration of splicing regulatory elements occur after mutation.\nA three-dimensional (3D) model of Claudin 16 was built using the homology modeling approach implemented in the modeler-9 package. The result showed that the conserved W-L-W motif of the Claudin family (Trp99, Leu116, and Trp117 in Claudin 16) was embedded in a crevice formed by the top of the four-helix bundle. Leu116 and Trp117 protrude from the tip of the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop and were likely associated with Trp99 to serve as a \u201chydrophobic anchor\u201d for the \u03b2-sheet domain. The L116 V mutation was predicted to abolish such interaction, resulting in a displacement of the \u03b2-sheet domain from the four-helix bundle domain of Claudin 16 (Fig. ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying processes/pathways', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions']"}

On the follow-up visits, he had no neurological deficit or electrodiagnostic changes on the fourth month after discharge.\nInformed consent was obtained from the parents of the patient.\nThe dynamics in the ALT, AST activity, and bilirubin level, as well as the timeline of the neurological changes, are displayed in . The remaining laboratory parameters were as follows: peripheral blood count, cholestatic enzymes, serum amylase, creatine kinase, choline esterase and electrolyte levels showed no abnormalities. Uro- and coproporphyrin tests were negative. Tests for Campylobacter jejuni, Epstein-Barr virus and Cytomegalovirus were negative. Nose and throat swabs were negative, as well as fecal cultures. The study of viral hepatitis markers /ELISA/ showed: HBsAg (-) negative, Anti HAV IgM (+) positive, HCV AB (-) negative. The child had received neither HAV vaccine nor prophylactic injection of immunoglobulin. He was contacted with other children with HAV during the large epidemics ongoing at that time in the Roma (Gypsy) headquarters in Plovdiv-city (Bulgaria).\nThe electrodiagnostic testing - nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography (EMG) was performed on day 10 post admission and 5 day following CSF-examination, in the absence of fever at the beginning and throughout the child's disease process. The testing was conducted and the neurological disorders were further clarified in the University Pediatric Neurological Center. Here is a brief description of the electrodiagnostic findings derived from the patient's medical record: \"Stimulation of the peroneus nerve bilaterally displayed a low amplitude of compound motor action potential (\u0421\u041c\u0410P), prolonged distal motor latency, temporal dispersion and reduced nerve conduction velocity. Findings at facial nerve stimulation bilaterally showed: CMAP-mildly prolonged distal latency time, temporal dispersion and reduced rate of conduction. Sensory nerve conduction velocities and sensory action potentials were normal. The follow-up at 4 months post-admission documented normal deep tendon reflexes and normal motor activity of the child. The follow-up electrodiagnostic testing of the facial and peroneal nerves registered normal CMAP. Conclusion: The electrodiagnostic findings suggest acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP)\u201d.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}
{"clinical_note": "In October 2016, a 9-yr-old girl with chief complaint of nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and decreased level of consciousness referred to the Neurology Department of Namazi Hospital, Shiraz, southern Iran.\nThe proband was the third offspring of healthy consanguineous parents (cousins). She had a healthy brother and sister. She was delivered through cesarean section due to oligohydramnios (birth weight = 2700 gr, body length = 48 cm). She had a short neck and trunk, pectus carinatum, and kyphosis. The first problem of the patient occurred at five months of age when growth retardation was detected in routine workup. Dental age was also delayed compared to chronological age. Indeed, bone survey showed delayed bone age, J-shaped sella, periarticular and diffused osteopenia, and flattening of thoracic vertebrae. She developed urinary tract infection when she was 11 months old. In voiding cystourethrogram, bilateral vesicoureteral reflux was diagnosed. Kidneys, ureters, and urinary bladder ultrasonography and renal scintigraphy were normal.\nAt the age of 4 yr, urine analysis showed proteinuria for the first time and after more workups, nephrotic syndrome was confirmed.\nShe had no new problems up to the age of 6 yr when she developed sudden onset right upper extremity paresthesia and weakness. Brain MRI was performed and showed ischemic and hemorrhagic infarct in the left parieto-occipital and left caudate lobe. Brain Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) also revealed significant wall irregularity of both internal carotid arteries, left Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA), basilar artery, and left Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA). MRI of the cervical spine was normal.\nTwo years later, she developed slurred speech and paresthesia, and weakness was progressed to her lower extremities. Brain MRI was performed again revealing new acute ischemic infarction in the right temporoparietal lobe. Encephalomalacia with surrounding gliosis was also noted involving the left parieto-occipital lobe because of the old infarction. Complete obstruction of the right MCA from the proximal part was seen in brain MRA. There was also evidence of significant wall irregularity and stenosis in basilar artery, PCA, Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA), internal carotid arteries, and vertebral arteries. These findings were in favour of moyamoya syndrome (). Brain Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV) was normal. ().\nAnalysis of SMARCAL1 gene was performed for detection of mutations (), which revealed a homozygous nonsynonymous homozygous mutation c. (2459G>A). This mutation was found by direct sequencing of both sense and antisense strands of the 16 coding and 2 noncoding exons of SMARCAL1 ().\nHer last admission was at the age of 9 yr due to nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and decreased level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale 7/15) at the Namazi Hospital, Shiraz, southern Iran, in October 2016. In the emergency room, she had four episodes of Generalized Tonic-Clonic (GTC) seizure, controlled by phenytoin and diazepam. The Electroencephalogram (EEG) was in favor of diffused brain suppression. Indeed, brain MRI noted encephalomalacia in the territory of right and left MCA with involvement of the whole right parietal lobe due to previous infractions. Besides, laminar necrosis was detected in the right parietal lobe. There was also evidence of a hematoma in the right parietal lobe. Ventricular dilatation was observed due to brain parenchymal atrophy and volume loss (). She also had hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and anuria, and high creatinine level due to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Hemodialysis was not done owing to her parents\u2019 dissatisfaction with insertion of central veins catheter, and she just received conservative therapy. Finally, she expired because of cardiopulmonary arrest following pulmonary hemorrhage. The laboratory findings of the patient have been presented in .\nInformed consent form was obtained from parents before participation in the study in accordance.

{"clinical_note": "Our patient is a 23-year-old Chinese woman with UCD who presented with seizures 2 years after the latest episode of metabolic decompensation. She was the second child of a non-consanguineous union. Her elder sister and parents were well and there was no history of early deaths in the family, especially male family members. She was delivered at full term via an emergency caesarean section for failure to progress and breech position. Her Apgar was 7 at 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes, probably due to prolonged maternal anesthesia.\nShe presented at 14 months of age with gross motor delay and intermittent vomiting after meals. She was alert and interactive. However, she was ataxic and her lower limbs were hypotonic with decreased power and brisk reflexes. The tone, power, and reflexes were normal in her upper limbs. She had intention tremors of the upper limbs. Computed tomography (CT) of her brain did not show any intracranial abnormalities. Her plasma ammonia level was markedly elevated at 327 umol/L (normal range 16 to 53 umol/L). She was treated with intravenously administered sodium benzoate with improvement in the hyperammonemia. She was diagnosed as having OTC deficiency in view of hyperammonemia, elevated glutamine at 1237 umol/L (normal range 400 to 700 umol/L), and elevated urinary orotic acid at 110 mmol/mol creatinine (normal range 0.5 to 3.3 mmol/mol creatinine). Her citrulline level was normal at 17 umol/L (normal range 5 to 60 umol/L). Sequencing of the OTC gene did not detect any pathological variant. The inability to identify a pathological variant by sequencing is not unusual. Pathological point mutation variants are found in approximately 80% of patients with enzymatically confirmed OTC deficiency. The remaining patients either have variants in the regulatory regions, variants within the introns, or have large deletions, all of which would not be detected by the sequencing that was done in this patient.\nOur patient had multiple hospital admissions from diagnosis to 19 years of age, due to episodes of metabolic decompensation with plasma ammonia levels ranging between 157 and 278 umol/L (Fig. ). These episodes occasionally occurred due to suboptimal compliance to protein-restricted diet, but most of the episodes occurred without any obvious trigger. She responded each time to intravenously administered sodium benzoate or sodium phenylbutyrate, L-arginine and 10% dextrose infusion with normalization of the ammonia levels. She would then resume her protein-restricted diet, with orally administered sodium benzoate and citrulline. Functionally, she was independent in the activities of daily living. However, she was intellectually impaired with an IQ score of 40 and received special education.\nShe presented with the first episode of seizure at 21 years of age. She did not have previous febrile seizures in childhood. There was no family history of epilepsy. She had altered mental state and incoherent speech on presentation. The plasma ammonia levels remained normal, ranging from 16 to 45 umol/L.\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded non-convulsive seizures with the onset of rhythmic fast activity (Fig. ), occasionally starting at the left frontotemporal region before becoming generalized (Fig. ). These were associated with clinical manifestations of oral automatisms, impaired consciousness, and right-sided head turn.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which was performed 2 days after the first seizure presentation, showed T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal hyperintensity in bilateral parahippocampal gyri with loss of gray-white matter differentiation and dilatation of bilateral temporal horns suggestive of hippocampal atrophy, due to mesial temporal sclerosis (Fig. ). There was also restricted diffusion noted in the parahippocampal regions on both sides (Fig. ). There was no prior MRI imaging performed. She was started on levetiracetam and pregabalin as these anti-epileptic drugs had minimal drug\u2013drug interaction. Pregabalin was added on as she continued to have breakthrough seizures with levetiracetam. The use of sodium valproate is contraindicated in UCDs as it predisposes to hyperammonemia. Her seizures remained well controlled with the use of the two anti-epileptic medications.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'recognizes associated conditions of a disease', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "Patient 1 is a 34-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD) who presented to the emergency department of an outside hospital with sudden onset and worsening epigastric pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed mild ascites within the pelvic cavity and thickening of the gastric antrum. Transabdominal ultrasound confirmed a small amount of ascites that did not require paracentesis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed a chronic-looking, deep ulcer with radiating folds at the antral region of the lesser curvature of the stomach measuring 1.5 cm in diameter. Biopsy of the specimen revealed poorly differentiated, signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) without Helicobacter pylori co-infection. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan indicated active disease in the stomach and no evidence of locoregional or distant metastasis.\nAt this point, the patient presented at our institution for a specialized, second opinion on the management of his malignancy. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings did not identify nodal involvement or intraperitoneal metastatic disease, respectively, clinically staging the tumor as cT2N0M0. Per NCCN guidelines, the patient underwent three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with ECX regimen (epirubicin 50 mg/m2, cisplatin 60 mg/m2, and capecitabine/xeloda 625 mg/m2), which were tolerated well by the patient. Re-staging CT scan of the abdomen showed moderate regression of the cancer. Four weeks after completion of the last dose of ETC, the patient underwent total gastrectomy and omentectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy and feeding jejunostomy tube (j-tube) placement.\nPathology of the tissue revealed invasive, poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma with singlet ring cell features that invaded into the muscularis propria and subserosal tissue, but with no evidence of invasion of the visceral peritoneum (T3) (Fig. a, b). Presence of malignant tissue was also confirmed with cytokeratin 7 immunostaining (Fig. c). The size of the tumor was 2.2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 0.6 cm with negative margins, but with 3 of 41 lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma as evidenced by cytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunostaining (N2) (Fig. ). With no identified distant metastases, the pathologic staging of the tumor was ypT3N2M0, stage IIIA.\nThe patient recovered post-operatively without complications. Upon resumption of oral and j-tube feedings, the patient was discharged from the hospital and returned to work approximately 1 month later. Six weeks post-surgery, the patient began adjuvant chemotherapy with TCX (epirubicin was substituted for taxotere) for three cycles. Patient is currently under surveillance, and the most recent CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis identified no active signs of disease. Up to the time of the preparation of this manuscript, the patient continues to follow without clinic and currently displays no evidence of disease.\nDuring the early course of medical workup at our institution, the patient received genetic counseling based on the high incidence of gastric and breast cancer in the family. Specifically, his mother was diagnosed with gastric cancer and died of the disease at the age of 49, while his sister died of the same disease at the age of 25. Further inquiry revealed that the maternal grandfather had also succumbed to what was likely gastric cancer based on the disease course provided by our patient, although a definitive diagnosis was never made. Furthermore, two maternal aunts were diagnosed with breast cancer in their 50s and 60s. The strong prevalence of these two cancers within the patient\u2019s maternal lineage raised suspicion for possible hereditary diffuse gastric carcinoma (HDGC) secondary to a genetic mutation in the CDH1 gene, particularly based on the recently updated guidelines []. Subsequent genetic analysis at our institution confirmed a monoallelic deletion of exons 1\u20132 of the CDH1 gene, further corroborating the clinical diagnosis.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
{"clinical_note": "Patient 2 is a 32-year-old male and a younger sibling of patient 1. Given the recently identified CDH1 mutation and HDGC diagnosis in his sibling, patient 2 had a 50% likelihood of being a CDH1 mutation carrier. Subsequent genetic screening at our institution confirmed that similarly to his older sibling, patient 2 had a monoallelic deletion of exons 1\u20132 of the CDH1 gene, predisposing him to the HDGC like several members of his family.\nInitial CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and EGD biopsy of gastric tissue indicated no sign of active malignancy. However, given the ~ 70% lifetime chance of developing HDGC, the patient was recommended prophylactic gastrectomy despite showing no signs or symptoms of disease. The patient agreed with the recommendation and underwent prophylactic total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy and feeding j-tube placement. Immunohistochemical analysis of gastric and intestinal tissue identified three microscopic foci of signet ring cells in the lamina propria without invasion of the submucosa (Fig. a, b), consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach. The rest of the intestinal tract showed no signs of malignancy, and 0 of 30 tested lymph showed positive for metastatic carcinoma. The tumor was pathologically staged as pT1aN0M0.\nThe patient recovered without complications and was discharged home on post-operative day 7. He returned to the emergency department 5 days later due to diffuse abdominal pain, dark-colored emesis, and no bowel movements for 2 days. Initial CT scan of abdomen and pelvis revealed dilated, gas-filled, small bowel loops. With the presumed diagnoses of ileus vs. partial small bowel obstruction, the patient was re-admitted to the surgical floor for further management. Subsequent tests were unremarkable except for elevated amylase of 286 U/L and lipase of 1153 U/L, suggesting pancreatitis as a more likely source for his abdominal pain.

Initial CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and EGD biopsy were unremarkable. Similarly to her older brother, she agreed to undergo prophylactic total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy and j-tube placement despite exhibiting no active signs or symptoms of disease. Immunohistochemical analysis of gastric and intestinal tissue revealed multiple microscopic signet ring cell foci varying in size, with the largest measuring 1 mm at its largest diameter (Fig. a, b). The tumor was confined to the lamina propria without evidence of invasion into the submucosa. All 23 tested lymph nodes tested negative for metastatic disease, and no other organ revealed signs of malignancy, staging the tumor as pT1aN0M0.\nThe patient recovered without major complications and was discharged on post-operative day 7 after abdominal pain and nutrition were adequately managed. Furthermore, the patient was offered prophylactic bilateral mastectomy given the increased incidence of LBC in women with CDH1 mutations. Initially, the patient refused the procedure citing the desire to breastfeed her future children and the low incidence of the disease prior to the age of 30. However, she subsequently consented to the procedure and underwent successful prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. During her outpatient recovery, patient 3 developed symptomatic gallstones.

She had no known prenatal risk factor except a history of a splenectomy, which was performed because of trauma-related hemorrhage according to her statement. Cesarean section (CS) was performed for obstructed labor without any complication, and severe PPH was diagnosed sixteen hours after the surgery. A postpartum hysterectomy was performed urgently because of uncontrolled bleeding. Persistent tachycardia and hypotension were recorded during the surgery and prehysterectomy hemoglobin value of 4 mg/dl was reported. Six units of erythrocyte suspension and four units of fresh frozen plasma were given during the surgery for replacement of the lost blood. Unfortunately, cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) developed in the last stages of the surgery, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed for 40 minutes until spontaneous heart beats began. The patient could not be extubated after the surgery and neurological examination revealed early signs of cerebral ischemia. Then, the patient was taken to Hacettepe University Hospital for intensive care and further evaluation.\nShe had fixed bilateral dilated pupils, her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was three, her body temperature was 33 centigrade degrees, her blood pressure was 143/70 mmHg (MAP=97), her heart rate was 120 beats per minute, and arterial pH was 6.81. Extensive periphery edema was observed, and moist rales were auscultated, which indicated the onset of pulmonary edema. Pneumothorax in the apical lobe of right lung, interlobular septal thickening, and ARDS findings were detected in thorax CT.

Complete blood count, blood biochemistry, arterial blood gas, coagulation profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) panel, cardiac enzymes, electrocardiography (ECG), and posteroanterior chest X-ray were evaluated. Multiple organ failure due to hypovolemic shock was diagnosed. Central vascular access was established. Fluid replacement and inotropic support with noradrenaline and dopamine were applied. The patient began to have treatment-resistant tonic-clonic seizures; antiepileptic and anesthetic drugs were given to stop the seizures. Targeted temperature management was started with surface temperature-management device. Hypothermia (34\u00b0C) was applied for the first 24 hours. Then normothermia (36\u00b0C) was applied for the next three days. The seizures were stopped after three days. Broad spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and colistin) were administrated. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and bilateral cerebellar herniation.\nDuring the search for the possible medical cause of the severe bleeding the patient's past medical record was evaluated, and it was found out that the patient had splenectomy at the age of sixteen. To our surprise, the consultation reports seven years ago revealed the diagnosis of NPD B. She received reconsultation from the pediatric metabolism and pediatric gastroenterology divisions which revealed that her parents had a consanguineous marriage, and she also had an older brother with NPD B.\nThere was no sign of gaining consciousness one week after cessation of the sedative drugs and no brain stem reflexes were obtained. Apnea test was positive and cerebral CT angiography was compatible with brain death. On the 14th day at the intensive care unit, brain death was confirmed.

He was diagnosed with EB during a genetic consultation that he had received before getting married at the age of 28 years. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with RDEB at the age of 38 years. Application of a strong external force to the skin results in blister formation as early as 15 min.

For endotracheal intubation, due to a difficulty in manually fixing a mask and lifting the lower jaw, the patient was asked to open his mouth and intubation was performed while the patient was conscious using intravenous injection of 1% propofol and intratracheal spraying of 1% xylocaine, under bronchoscopic guidance using a McGRATH\u2122 MAC video laryngoscope (Covidien). Isodine disinfectant was used for skin disinfection of the surgical site, as the patient was tolerant of chemical stimulations. A skin incision was made sharply with a scalpel, with particular care taken to avoid contact of a steel instrument with the skin. Partial hepatectomy of the lateral segment with combined diaphragmatic resection was performed. The diaphragmatic defect was closed with a 2-0 nonabsorbable suture while the lung was compressed, without chest tube placement. A 19 Fr closed low-pressure continuous-suction drain was placed on the liver resection surface. A block catheter was also placed on the bilateral rectus sheaths in case of postoperative wound pain. The wound was closed by two-layer suturing with a 0 monofilament absorbable suture for the peritoneal muscle layer and a 4-0 monofilament absorbable suture for dermal closure. The wound was covered with a Mepilex\u00ae Border Ag dressing (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care). The drain was fixed with a needle and a suture and then with a Mepitac\u00ae tape (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care). The operative and anesthetic times were 346 and 457 min, respectively.\nThe patient was discharged from the hospital on day 9. He had an uneventful postoperative course with no abnormality of the wound in postoperative outpatient examination.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management', 'most appropriate long-term treatment']"}
{"clinical_note": "A one-year-old male patient referred to the Gastroenterology Clinic due to an unusual chronic constipation, associated with abdominal distension, since six months of age.\nHe was born full term, weight 3.2 kg and length 49 cm, presented meconium elimination within the first 24 hours of life, and neonatal screening was considered normal for hemoglobinopathies, phenylketonuria, and CH (filter paper thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH < 10 mIU/mL). He was exclusively breastfed during the first six months, bowel habit was three times a day with normal stools, and no blood or mucus was ever noticed. While he started complementary feeding at this age (pureed fruit, vegetables, potatoes, and meats), bowel movements became once a week, being stools like separate hard lumps, with no blood, and requiring additional force to be eliminated. Even though he received laxative conventional therapy from six to twelve months of age, comprised by lactulose 2 mL/kg/day and glycerol suppositories 1g each five days, he showed no clinical improvement. Stools only occurred while taking suppositories.\nAlong with chronic constipation and abdominal distension, he also presented with failure to thrive, severe developmental delay, bradycardia, rarefied hair and eyebrows, hoarse cry, and macroglossia (Figures and ). Abdominal distension was mostly due to massively air-filled bowel (tympanism), with no palpable mass of stools. At one year of age, he was able to hold up his head (since eight months) but was unable to sit with support or say simple words. All growth standards are according to 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) []: weight 5.07 kg (<3rd percentile) and height 63.5 cm (<3rd percentile) (Figures and ).\nAnorectal manometry (ARM) tracings showed a great variation in internal anal sphincter resting pressure, with some transitory relaxation along with the insufflation of the rectal balloon, showing the presence of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex. Nonetheless, there were many transitory relaxations in the resting pressure simulating rectoanal inhibitory reflex without rectal stimulus, which ended up as an inconclusive test (). Intestinal transit showed a massively dilated stool-filled colon, although small bowel was not dilated. Contrast took nine hours to travel from the stomach to the cecum, which presented a marked distention that reached a diameter of 12.5 cm (), along with a dilatation of the whole colon (). Contrast only reached sigmoid colon and rectum after six days through a colonic cleansing (). Thus, intestinal transit evaluation was compatible with motility disturbance and a massively dilated stool filled colon that brought up the hypothesis of Hirschsprung disease.\nAlthough neonatal screening for CH was normal, considering his clinical appearance, the history of chronic severe constipation, abdominal distension, and bradycardia, as well as the poor growth and development, thyroid retesting was indicated and revealed a high TSH (>100 mcIU/mL; normal range: 0.27\u20134.2) and a low free thyroxine (free T4, <0.15 ng/dL; normal range: 0.93\u20131.70). Levothyroxine sodium (LT4) replacement therapy was started immediately. After one month of adequate LT4 therapy, bowel movements were recovered, and intestinal habit became once a day with normal aspect stools. After six months of adequate LT4 therapy, laxative therapy was discontinued, and he recovered clinical aspect, with no abdominal distension (Figures and ), showing a rapid catchup in both weight and growth velocity (Figures and ). ARM was repeated and considered completely normal (). At 1.6 years of age, he was able to sit without support, and at 1.9 years, he started walking with support and saying simple words.\nAt five years of age, he showed no physical delay, with normal language and communication, socially and emotionally adequate, with satisfactory LT4 replacement. Weight was 16.4 kg (15\u201350th percentile) and height was 110.7 cm (50th percentile) (Figures and ). So far, the etiology of primary CH was defined as a thyroid hypoplasia through ultrasonography.\nAt eight years of age, he was euthyroid, with appropriate weight and height, respectively, 21.6 kg (50th percentile) and 128.6 cm (50th percentile). Nonetheless, despite normal thyroid function, he presented with a relapse of constipation, being bowel movements once or twice a day with scybalous stools, associated with a discrete abdominal distension (TSH 1.66 mcIU/mL; free T4 1.22 ng/dL). Laxative diet and medications (macrogol 1.5 g/kg daily) were reintroduced with poor clinical response. Serological testing for celiac disease was performed, with normal results of total immunoglobulin A (IgA) and tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-IgA antibodies. Rectal mucosal and submucosal biopsies were performed and showed the presence of normal ganglion cells (at 2, 4, and 6 cm above the dentate line). He started sacral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), whose parameters were 20 Hz and 200 \u00b5s, during 30 minutes weekly, with electrodes placed in the corresponding S2 and S3 dermatomes. After four sessions, he presented with improvement of bowel habit.\nThe mother provided written consent and permission to publish this case.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}
{"clinical_note": "A four-year-old girl presented to the emergency service with painful left hip and fever. There was no previous relevant medical history. There were no other local or systemic symptoms, except for a cervical adenopathy. On physical examination, she walked with a limp, and movements of the left hip were painful (mainly external rotation), but not restricted. Blood exam revealed anemia (Hb 8.7 gr/dL), normal WBC, ESB of 123 mm, and reactive C protein of 149.7 mg/L. An initial X-ray to the pelvis revealed no changes. An ultrasound of the left hip was performed revealing small infusion and synovitis. Guided puncture was then performed being macroscopically compatible with reactive arthritis, and general and bacteriological tests were demanded. Because of the unusual characteristics of the pain, a CT scan to the abdomen and pelvis was performed revealing a left adrenal mass and retroperitoneal adenopathies in the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery ().\nDespite the painful complaints of the patient, no bone or articular involvement was found in the CT scan. No further alterations were reported in the thoracic CT scan or in peripheral blood smears. Bacteriological examination of the hip effusion was negative. MRI was also performed. The direct myelogram was compatible with infiltration from neuroblastoma. Bone marrow biopsy and cervical adenopathy specimens were collected to perform histological diagnosis. Skeletal scintigraphy demonstrated numerous points of osteoblastic activity compatible with metastatic activity, and the 12 iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy concluded the following: \u201cAbdominal mass with low expression of noradrenergic transporters. Diffuse bone metastasization with high expression of noradrenergic transporters. No other soft tissue involvement was detected.\u201d In the histological report of the cervical adenopathy, the diagnosis of neuroblastoma NOS was performed. Immunohistochemistry revealed extensive expression for synaptophysin and CD56 (NCAM) and absence of expression of myogenin. ().\nBone marrow biopsy revealed extensive metastatic involvement. The patient started chemotherapy two weeks after admission, with 8 cycles of rapid COJEC protocol. After six months of follow-up, the primary tumor was still without criteria for resection, despite a decrease in the metastatic involvement. Given the chemotherapy-related renal toxicity, it was decided to proceed with irinotecan in combination with temozolomide (TEMIRI).

{"clinical_note": "Patient A presented as a mostly healthy 15-year-old Caucasian female with some developmental disabilities and ADHD, characterized by poor attention span, poor attention to details, poor organization, forgetfulness, excessive talking, impulsivity, and distractibility since age seven. Her father reported two severe brain injuries around the age of five. Over the course of one year at age 15, she required four inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations and numerous outpatient and medication management appointments due to an acute onset of \u201cseizure-like\u201d spells, psychotic thinking, and seemingly schizophrenic symptoms, manifesting as auditory hallucinations (AH) and catatonic movements. The differential diagnosis included schizophrenia, severe Tourette syndrome, Major Depressive Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.\nOver time, Patient A had several strange physical symptoms including dysphonia, mouth twitches, echolalia, frequent pacing, frequent cussing, holding her breath, repeatedly asking the same questions, crying and laughing for no reason, staring, outstretching of her arms for 30 minutes, stumbling, worsening dysgraphia, unable to solve math problem, and worsening reading skills.\nInitially, the change in her behavior was thought to be a neurologic issue due to the \u201cseizure-like\u201d spells, characterized by uncontrollable mouth twitching, eye rolling, and staring into space. However, after an unrevealing neurology evaluation she was referred to psychiatry. Mood and anxiety disorders were also suspected due to fears of social situations, making mistakes, and trying new things in conjunction with irritability, muscle tension, insomnia, self-consciousness, stomachaches, and feelings of worthlessness resulting in self-blame.\nAfter a few months of declining mental health, patient A began outpatient psychotherapy sessions, where she discussed issues with being bullied and social anxiety at school. During these sessions, patient A's professional clinical counselor (LPCC) consistently noted she was zoning out, mouthing words silently, seemingly in response to internal stimuli, and exhibiting unilateral catatonic right arm movements.\nDue to the lack of outpatient success, patient A was admitted to a partial hospitalization program (PHP). There, she displayed symptoms of mouthing words and laughing as a response to internal stimuli, outbursts of cussing at friends not present, leaving food in mouth for hours before swallowing, and deterioration of handwriting. Due to the severity of symptoms, patient A was admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit, where she was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. Interestingly, she had experienced a Streptococcus infection one month prior to this first admission. While on the inpatient unit for eight days, risperidone 0.25 mg BID was started and sequentially increased to 0.5 mg QAM and 1.0 mg QPM, which caused enough improvement for patient A to return to the PHP. All neuroleptic trials for this patient lasted for about six to eight weeks.\nThe prevalence of her auditory hallucinations (AH's) increased in quantity and severity while in the PHP, so she was admitted a second time to inpatient psychiatry, where she began treatment for psychosis and schizophrenia. During this admission, she admitted that some of the voices in her head were her own and another voice was a male bully from school telling patient A to kill herself, raising questions as to whether these were actual AHs or flashbacks from past traumatic experiences.\nUnfortunately, patient A continued to have difficulty with chewing and swallowing food, which led to gagging, choking, and emesis, as well as echolalia, restlessness, inappropriate smiling, and irregular arm movements. Her medication regimen was further altered to include benztropine 0.5 mg BID, ziprasidone 20 mg BID, and trazodone 25-50 mg at night for sleep. On this medication regimen, patient A showed improvement for the first few days before the AHs and other symptoms began to once again hinder her daily function.\nAfter almost two weeks of crisis stabilization, patient A was discharged and sent back to the PHP, where thought blocking, flat affect, responding to internal stimuli, anxiety, and jerking movements persisted. She then began having self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Ziprasidone was increased to 40 mg QAM and 80 mg QPM with the goal of relieving the AHs while minimizing psychotic and seemingly schizophrenic symptoms. Propranolol 10 mg was introduced as needed for agitation. After little improvement, she was admitted to inpatient for a third time for a higher level of care.\nDuring this hospitalization, ziprasidone was cross-tapered with aripriprazole with little benefit. Aripriprazole was then cross-tapered with lurasidone up to a dose of 40 mg QAM. Benztropine was increased to 0.75 mg BID and lorazepam to 0.25 mg BID and 0.5 mg QHS was also started. The as needed trazodone and propranolol were discontinued. With this regimen, AHs were only reported every other day, and activities of daily living (ADL) were able to be completed with less anxiety and prompting from staff, allowing her to be discharged from her third inpatient hospitalization.", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy']"}
{"clinical_note": "A 13-year-old female patient was presented for consultation to the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, School of Dentistry, Lebanese University. Her chief complaint was the crowding of her anterior teeth. Her medical and dental histories were noncontributory, and the patient did not mention any previous or recent habit. On physical examination, no swelling or tenderness was documented.\nUpon clinical examination, the patient had all her permanent teeth and a retained mandibular left second primary molar. Radiographic records consisted of an orthopantomogram, a lateral cephalogram, a posteroanterior cephalogram, and a hand wrist radiograph. The orthopantomogram revealed a well-defined radiolucent lesion on the mandibular left side surrounding the unerupted mandibular left second premolar which appeared to be mesially tipped below the retained primary second molar. The root of the adjacent premolar was included in the lesion but did not reveal any root resorption (Figures and ).\nGoing back to the old orthopantomogram (OPG) of the patient collected by the Pediatrics Department, it was noted that no lesion was visible at that time (). The patient was referred to the Oral Pathology Department in order to obtain a meticulous diagnosis concerning the radiolucent lesion that was detected on the orthopantomogram during the initial diagnosis. The differential diagnosis for the lesion included a DC, an odontogenic keratocyst, and an ameloblastoma. Histologically, a thick epithelial lining with rete ridges was present. Moreover, chronic inflammatory cellular infiltration appeared in the capsule of the cyst. All these findings confirmed that the diagnosed cyst is a DC. The major objective of initiating the treatment as early as possible in this patient was to hinder the progression of the DC prohibiting its destructive consequences. Moreover, the aim of initiating a nonaggressive (marsupialization) treatment was to save the involved tooth, allowing its healthy eruption.\nSeveral treatment modalities of a DC have been reported in the literature ranging from marsupialization to enucleation. The common treatment for DC is enucleation followed by extraction of the involved tooth. When the cyst is large, the first approach is marsupialization to decrease the size of the osseous defect and then enucleation and tooth extraction are performed afterwards [\u2013].\nEnucleation is the chosen treatment plan whenever the cyst is small and saving the involved tooth is impossible. This treatment modality should be avoided in large cysts since it is usually accompanied by facial, esthetic, and functional defects [].\nOther approaches are considered when the cyst is small and when the patient is young. In cases of enlarged follicles of impacted canines, exposing the affected tooth surgically and the traction of the tooth by orthodontic means leads to the cessation of the cystic lesion and the preservation of the affected tooth [].\nTaking into consideration that the diagnosed cyst can potentially become an aggressive lesion with a bone destructive ability that might lead to loss of the involved teeth, root resorption, pain, and facial asymmetry, and considering the age of the patient, a primary approach by marsupialization was initiated ().\nAfter the surgery, the patient was instructed to wear the acrylic resin obturator that was previously fabricated to maintain the surgical opening during healing and assure success of the surgery (). The patient was asked to eat with the obturator in place and remove it only for cleaning. Follow-up appointments were scheduled every three months postsurgery to assure the eruption of the second premolar and the absence of any recurrence.\nThe postsurgical orthopantomogram (OPG) that was taken 6 months after the surgery revealed the absence of any radiolucent lesion and the successful eruption of the mandibular left second premolar (Figures and ).", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'most appropriate management of selected conditions', 'appropriate surgical management']"}

The testicular mass was fully mobile within the subcutaneous space and minimally tender and did not appear to be connected to the external ring. The patient had no other complaints, and the rest of his physical examination was unremarkable. A follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a partially visualized, heterogenous, and enhancing right inguinal mass, raising the concern for a peripheral nerve sheath tumor or sarcoma of the spermatic cord ().\nThe mass was surgically excised from the spermatic cord. During surgery, it was noted that the mass was located inside the external cord, but outside of the internal spermatic fascia. It had eroded through the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. Nonetheless, the mass could easily be separated from the spermatic cord and was submitted to pathology for evaluation. Macroscopically, the mass weighed 67.5 grams and measured 7 x 5.5 x 2.5 centimeters. Its outer surface was smooth, pink/white in color and covered by a thin membrane. The cut surface of the mass was white and firm and had a whorled texture containing occasional small cysts (). The tumor border is well delineated.

Other comorbidities included antiphospholipid syndrome under warfarin management, multiple myocardial infarctions, with 2 coronary artery bypass grafting procedures, placement of biventricular automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and placement of left ventricular assist device (HeartWare) 5 months earlier.\nOn hospital day (HD) 14, after optimization of hemodynamics with diuretics and inotropic support, the patient was listed for heart-kidney transplant and transferred to the intensive care unit. On HD 24, the patient was taken to the operating room for combined heart-kidney transplant; however, only orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) was possible. During the OHT, acute right ventricular graft dysfunction developed, resulting in cardiogenic shock, requiring placement of VA-ECMO support through central cannulation and withholding of the single-kidney transplantation. VA-ECMO was utilized to allow the newly transplanted heart to rest and recover and to optimize hemodynamics and volume status in order for the patient to eventually receive the single-kidney transplantation.

{"clinical_note": "A 63-year-old female sought medical intervention for a painless, firm, mobile mass within her right cheek. For the previous year-and-a-half, she had experienced right facial nerve paralysis, which progressed to facial numbness and progressive hearing loss. A PET-CT scan showed an FDG-avid 2.2 x 2.0 cm mass centered along the anterolateral aspect of the right masseter muscle without parotid gland involvement (). An MRI of the lesion indicated enhancement of the right trigeminal nerve from its origin to the point where it entered Meckel's cave along with enhancement of the right facial nerve from the internal auditory canal to the middle ear. A fine needle aspiration of the mass showed clusters of atypical spindled cells with elongated, irregular nuclei; the tumor was diagnosed as a malignancy consistent with neural or mesenchymal origin (Figures and ). A total right parotidectomy with selective resection of the facial and trigeminal (mandibular division) nerves was performed. Histopathologic review showed a tumor adjacent to, but not primarily involving, the parotid gland, characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells, many with multiple nuclei, grouped in interwoven fascicles and heavily interwoven with lymphocytes (). Nuclei were prominent and markedly pleomorphic, and the mitotic index was high (28/10 high-power fields; ). Immunohistochemical stains showed S100 to be strongly and diffusely positive (); collagen IV was 2+ positive around individual tumor cells (); Mart1/MelanA and HMB-45 were negative (not shown). Pancytokeratin, CK5/6, p63, desmin, CD34, and the mutant protein BRAF V600E also were negative. The tumor was diagnosed as a poorly differentiated MPNST. There was no evidence of metastatic tumor in the additionally submitted lymph nodes. The patient subsequently completed radiation therapy.\nApproximately eight months after the initial resection, the patient presented with severe hearing loss in her right ear and difficulty with walking and balance. An MRI revealed a 6.4 mm, contrast-enhancing lesion at the right cerebellopontine (CP) angle () and a similar 3.8 mm lesion slightly distal running along the 7th cranial nerve. At this time, a 1.5 x 1.5 cm irregular pigmented lesion also was noted on her right cheek. A punch biopsy of this lesion revealed LMM (). In this biopsy, the Breslow depth was 0.25 mm; neither ulceration nor dermal mitotic activity was noted. Additionally, although neither lymphovascular nor perineural invasion was identified, the possibility was raised that the original parotid-region mass represented a metastatic melanoma instead of a separate primary MPNST.\nThe patient then underwent resection of the CP angle tumor as well as cranial nerve 7 approximately 23 months after the parotid-region mass was resected. Histopathologic review demonstrated spindled-to-epithelioid cells with pleomorphic nuclei (). In several areas, fine, golden-brown pigment was observed. The mitotic index was 4/10 high-power fields, and a Ki-67 immunostain showed an 18% index of proliferation. Similar to the original parotid-region mass, the tumor showed strong and diffuse positivity for S100 (), and there was weak focal reactivity for collagen IV (). Unlike the originally resected parotid-region mass, the CP angle lesion exhibited strong and diffuse positivity for Mart1/MelanA and HMB-45 (Figures and ) and was diagnosed as malignant melanoma.\nShe also underwent a wide excision of her right cheek melanoma, which revealed residual melanoma with a Breslow depth of 0.55 mm. Again, no dermal mitotic activity, ulceration, lymphovascular, or perineural invasion were noted. The tumor was again positive for Mart1/MelanA, as was demonstrated in the original biopsy.\nGiven the uncertain relationship between the original parotid-region and the CP angle masses, next-generation sequencing of a panel of 300+ genes was performed on both the parotid-region mass and the CP angle lesion (Foundation Medicine; Boston, MA). Both tumors showed high tumor mutation burden (TMB), and each showed over twenty potentially clinically significant genomic alterations; among these, they shared nineteen ().", "topic_list": "['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)', 'underlying anatomic structure or physical location', 'select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study', 'select most likely diagnosis', 'appropriate surgical management']"}
