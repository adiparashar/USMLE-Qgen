{"clinical_note":"A 33-year-old female with no prior medical comorbidities, who recently gave birth to a healthy girl child four months ago, was brought to the emergency department with sudden onset weakness of both upper and lower limbs that started four days prior and rapidly progressed to a state of quadriplegia. She was conscious and obeyed simple commands with eyes and mouth; however, she had severe dysarthria. She had bilateral facial palsy and bulbar palsy. She had flaccid, hyporeflexic, pure motor quadriplegia with limbs showing only a subtle withdrawal flicker to pain. MRI of the brain revealed hyperintensity in the central pons in diffusion-weighted images (Figure ), T2-weighted images (Figure ), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (Figure ) without abnormal contrast enhancement (Figure ), consistent with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) (Figure ).\nThe biochemical analysis showed hypernatremia while the remaining electrolytes were normal. The rest of the blood workup was unremarkable. Relatives denied an antecedent history of hyponatremia with rapid correction. The patient was started on sodium correction and was given five days intravenous (IV) pulse methylprednisolone 1 g\/day to stabilize the blood-brain barrier. The patient recovered significantly to normal power. She was then considered to have idiopathic hypernatremic osmotic demyelination and was discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 0.\nOne year later, she presented to the neurology department with a one-week history of generalized fatigue, diffuse myalgias, and three days history of rapidly progressive weakness of all four limbs making her wheelchair-bound one day before the presentation. Her initial vital signs were unremarkable. She was noted to have a pure motor flaccid symmetric quadriparesis with proximal more than distal weakness and generalized hyporeflexia. Clinical examination of other systems was normal. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) done on day three of onset of weakness demonstrated reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes of bilateral tibial and peroneal nerves with absent F waves and H reflexes. CMAP of tested nerves in upper limbs showed preserved amplitudes with normal distal latency and absent F waves. There were no conduction blocks. The sensory conduction study of all the tested nerves in all four limbs was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis did not show albumin-cytological dissociation. Therefore, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) or hypokalemia-related electrophysiological abnormalities were considered. A basic metabolic panel revealed severe hypokalemia (potassium 2.2 mEq\/L). Arterial blood gas (ABG) and 24-hour urine analysis showed metabolic acidosis, consistent with renal tubular acidosis type-1 (distal). Autoimmune workup was positive anti-SSA\/Ro autoantibodies. The biopsy of the minor salivary gland was pathognomonic. The patient was diagnosed with pSS according to the new classification criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Overall clinical, electrical, and biochemical data suggest the presence of renal tubular acidosis with secondary hypokalemia-related quadriparesis due to pSS.\nThe patient was given intravenous (IV) potassium supplementation through a peripheral vein at a rate not exceeding 10 mEq\/hour and subsequently was shifted to oral liquid formulation in the form of a syrup. Oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation was given at a dose of 1 mEq\/kg\/day for renal tubular acidosis. With potassium correction, there was a rapid recovery in the power of all four limbs within 24 hours of admission. The patient was initiated on 1 mg\/kg\/day of oral prednisolone and was referred to a rheumatologist for further management. She remained asymptomatic on her six-month follow-up.\n","topic":"selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy","keypoint_data":{"keypoint_data":{"retrieved_kp_score":57.90625,"retrieved_keypoints":"Level0: Pregnancy, Childbirth, & the PuerperiumLevel1: Abnormal Processes: Health and Health Maintenance, Screening, Diagnosis, Management, Risks, PrognosisLevel2: Newborn (birth to 4 weeks of age)Level3: disorders of the newborn: screening, newborn; ABO incompatibility in newborn; hemolytic disease due to Rh incompatibility; birth asphyxia syndrome (liveborn neonate); birth trauma (eg, cord compression, brachial palsy, lacerations); drug withdrawal syndrome in newborn; feeding problems in newborn; fetal growth and development abnormalities, including fetal growth restriction; gastrointestinal obstruction; hypocalcemia of newborn; infections, congenital or peripartum (cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses, HIV, hepatitis B, rubella virus, parvovirus B19 virus, varicella zoster virus, Chlamydia trachomatis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Treponema pallidum, Toxoplasma gondii); intrapartum fetal distress\/death including stillborn; jaundice, fetal\/neonatal\/perinatal; laryngomalacia; macrosomia (large for gestational age); meconium aspiration syndrome; neonatal acne; neonatal Candida infection (thrush); neonatal hypoglycemia; neonatal conjunctivitis and dacryocystitis; ophthalmic gonorrhea; phenylketonuria; premature infant; post- term infant; pseudomembranous colitis of infancy; respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease); respiratory problems after birth (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, tracheomalacia; tracheoesophageal fistula in neonates); retinitis of prematurity; seizures in newborn; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), apparent life-threatening event (ALTE); tetanus neonatorum | 612","keypoint_gpt4_output":"Keypoint: potassium supplementation in hypokalemia"}},"status":"success"}
{"clinical_note":"A 54-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, unvaccinated for COVID-19 presented with shortness of breath, cough, and pleuritic chest pain for four days. Upon initial evaluation in the emergency room, vital signs were as follows: BP was 118\/63 mmHg, HR was 80 bpm, temperature was 103.1\u00b0F, and oxygen saturation was 91% on room air. Lab work showed nasopharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2, leukopenia (WBC: 3.8x103\/uL), elevated D-dimer (514 ng\/mL), hyperglycemia (126 mg\/dL), elevated liver enzymes (AST: 224 U\/L, ALT: 175 U\/L), elevated c-reactive protein (CRP) (129.8 mg\/L), and elevated respiratory procalcitonin (0.26 ng\/mL). Chest x-ray showed patchy bilateral lung opacities. CT chest with contrast showed moderate bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit and started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and dexamethasone. EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm with HR of 80 bpm (Figure ). The day following admission, the patient was started on remdesivir. After two doses of remdesivir, the patient developed severe sinus bradycardia with HR of 30-40 bpm, and remdesivir was discontinued (Figure ). She continued to have bradycardia with HR of 45-60 bpm persistently throughout the hospitalization.

{"clinical_note":"A 47-year-old Caucasian male with a history of an aortic valve replacement, Factor V Leiden anomaly, migraines, and a competitive cycling hobby presented with new paracentral blind spots in the right eye following a fishing trip in Florida on August 28, 2014. The patient reported that the vision loss began during a fishing trip when he became dehydrated and had not resolved. He described three to four similar events that occurred previously following episodes of extreme physical activity, however, all resolving. On presentation in 2016, visual acuity was 20\/20 in both eyes. No fundus abnormalities were noted. Amsler grid testing revealed two scotomas about 1 and 4 degrees superior nasal to fixation in the right eye. Spectral-domain OCT imaging also revealed several hyperreflective bands in the middle retina of the right eye (Figure ). In Figure , the hyporeflective lesions seen at the border of the fovea inferior temporal and slightly further out were consistent with his subjective superior nasal scotomas on Amsler grid testing. Spectral-domain OCT findings of PAMM were corroborated with the Chief of the Retinal Service at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. The patient was diagnosed with findings consistent with PAMM. At that time, no treatment was given. While diagnostic measures were not taken during this patient\u2019s first few described episodes, it was thought that the previous episodes were also consistent with PAMM, given their similar presentation on the Amsler grid testing and symptomatology.\nIn mid-2018, the patient presented with a left-sided visual scotoma that had developed following a recent episode of febrile gastroenteritis. Treatment started with niacinamide OTC minerals, which helped initially over 30-40 minutes. After consulting with his cardiologist, nitroglycerin was prescribed but not taken. The patient was treated with 325 mg of aspirin and 200 mg of ibuprofen every 4 hours, with minimal relief. Aspirin and ibuprofen were administered because they are anti-inflammatory and blood thinners. The scotoma improved over the course of the next week but did not fully resolve. A permanent small scotoma remained.\nIn 2019, the patient began to experience similar symptoms after vigorous exercise. The patient was treated with 0.4 mg nitroglycerin sublingually previously prescribed by his cardiologist. Within 45 minutes, the visual scotoma improved, and within a few hours, it completely resolved. Since this occasion, the patient experienced two subsequent episodes of the development of visual scotomas, both resolving within minutes of the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin.\nThe patient described the lesions as permanent obstructions in the field of vision. They appear as small opaque structures, with a purple hue. The structures blend into the background without a distinct outline. The right eye lesions seen in Figure appeared at about 11 o\u2019clock in the field of the patient's vision and did not move.\n","topic":"predicts the most likely laboratory or diagnostic study result","keypoint_data":{"keypoint_data":{"retrieved_kp_score":58.53125,"retrieved_keypoints":"Level0: Nervous System & Special SensesLevel1: Abnormal Processes: Health and Health Maintenance, Screening, Diagnosis, Management, Risks, PrognosisLevel2: Disorders of the eye and eyelidLevel3: disorders of the retina: hypertensive retinopathy; macular degeneration; papilledema; retinal detachment; retinitis pigmentosa; vascular disorders affecting the retina, including central retinal artery embolus, retinal hemorrhage, amaurosis fugax, embolus, carotid artery stenosis, central retinal vein occlusion; visual impairment\/blindness, night blindness | 82","keypoint_gpt4_output":"Keypoint: visual impairment\/blindness, night blindness"}},"status":"success"}
