The arterial blood gas shows a normal pH, slightly elevated PaCO2, and significantly decreased PaO2, indicative of impaired gas exchange. Additionally, the chest x-ray findings, although not described in this scenario, would be important to consider. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a pulmonary embolism, which is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs, often caused by blood clots that travel to the lungs from the legs or, rarely, other parts of the body. Pulmonary embolism can present with shortness of breath, chest pain, rapid heart rate, and low oxygen levels, as seen in this patient.\n\nPleural effusion, pneumothorax, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are less likely given the acute onset and the described clinical picture. Pleural effusion and pneumothorax would typically present with physical findings such as decreased breath sounds and possibly tracheal deviation.

Laboratory assessment is in Table. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Chest X-ray on admission shows worsening right pleural effusion with new opacity obscuring the lower two-third of the right lung and a new pleural-based opacity in the left upper lobe Figure. CT chest with contrast shows large right pleural effusion and associated right basilar consolidation and abdominal ascites. The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit and started on methylprednisolone, piperacillin-tazobactam, remdesivir, and baricitinib.

Chest X-ray showed near-complete opacification of bilateral lung fields and subsequently was intubated. On Day 4, tense ascites were noted and the patient underwent paracentesis, which removed 4.25 L of bloody, serosanguinous fluid. Renal replacement therapy started.

Laboratory assessment is in Table. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Chest X-ray on admission shows worsening right pleural effusion with new opacity obscuring the lower two-third of the right lung and a new pleural-based opacity in the left upper lobe Figure. CT chest with contrast shows large right pleural effusion and associated right basilar consolidation and abdominal ascites. The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit and started on methylprednisolone, piperacillin-tazobactam, remdesivir, and baricitinib. The patient clinically deteriorated on Day 2 and was transferred to the intensive care unit for thoracentesis and possible intubation. Thoracentesis removed 1.95 L of bloody, serosanguineous fluid obtained, with partial resolution of the effusion Figure. On Day 3, the patient developed septic shock, florid renal failure, and lethargy and was started on intravenous fluids and norepinephrine drip. Chest X-ray showed near-complete opacification of bilateral lung fields and subsequently was intubated. On Day 4, tense ascites were noted and the patient underwent paracentesis, which removed 4.25 L of bloody, serosanguinous fluid. Renal replacement therapy started.
