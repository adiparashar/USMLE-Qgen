The SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily targets the respiratory system, causing pneumonia and pleural effusion as seen in the chest imaging. The systemic inflammation in sepsis can damage the endothelial lining of blood vessels, causing leakage and fluid accumulation, which can explain the ascites seen in this patient.

In the ER, her vital signs were BP 133/93, HR 103 bpm, RR 22 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 96% on 40 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, and afebrile. Laboratory assessment is in Table. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Chest X-ray on admission shows worsening right pleural effusion with new opacity obscuring the lower two-third of the right lung and a new pleural-based opacity in the left upper lobe Figure. CT chest with contrast shows large right pleural effusion and associated right basilar consolidation and abdominal ascites. The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit and started on methylprednisolone, piperacillin-tazobactam, remdesivir, and baricitinib. The patient clinically deteriorated on Day 2 and was transferred to the intensive care unit for thoracentesis and possible intubation. Thoracentesis removed 1.95 L of bloody, serosanguineous fluid obtained, with partial resolution of the effusion Figure. On Day 3, the patient developed septic shock, florid renal failure, and lethargy and was started on intravenous fluids and norepinephrine drip. Chest X-ray showed near-complete opacification of bilateral lung fields and subsequently was intubated. On Day 4, tense ascites were noted and the patient underwent paracentesis, which removed 4.25 L of bloody, serosanguinous fluid. Renal replacement therapy started.

In such severe cases, secondary bacterial infections can pose a significant risk, exacerbating the patient's condition and complicating treatment efforts.
