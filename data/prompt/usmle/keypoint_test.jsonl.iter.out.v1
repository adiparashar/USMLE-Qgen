{"clinical_note": "A 59-year-old female, current smoker with 20 pack-years history, with a past medical history only significant for hypertension, gradually developed anorexia, nausea, fatigue, and weight loss. She initially presented to the emergency department with left flank pain and on CT scan of the abdomen was found to have diffuse osteosclerotic lesions in visualized bones. She was then followed up in primary care clinic where workup for an occult malignancy was initiated. There was no palpable mass or axillary adenopathy on breast examination. She had multiple mammograms in the past, some of which had shown suspicious architecture, which was followed up with multiple breast ultrasounds that had revealed benign findings. Mammogram was repeated and was reported benign with BI-RADS 2. Nuclear bone scan was unremarkable. CT chest revealed no pulmonary lesions but there were small mediastinal, submental, and axillary lymphadenopathy and several subcutaneous lesions on the back (one of which was excised and showed inclusion epidermal cyst). Multiple myeloma workup was negative.\nWhile the workup was ongoing, the patient started to experience lower back pain associated with weakness of lower extremities, numbness, tingling, and balance issues. She developed constipation as well as urinary incontinence. MRI of the brain and spine redemonstrated similar bony lesions in vertebrae, and also revealed abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement in the brainstem extending along the entire spinal cord (Figure ). Due to this finding, the patient was admitted to the hospital for further workup. Her mentation was normal. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in lower extremities, Babinski was positive bilaterally, and gait was ataxic. Strength was overall 5/5 in upper extremities and 4/5 in lower extremities. Sensations to touch, pain, temperature, and vibration were normal. Cranial nerve examination was normal, and cerebellar signs were absent. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal. Lumbar puncture showed increased protein (1187 mg/dL) and white blood cells 43 cells/uL (lymphocytes 70%, monocytes 30%) in CSF. CSF cytology was negative for carcinoma and showed numerous lymphocytes but the negative finding could also have been due to delay in processing the specimen. Peripheral blood flow cytometry revealed monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis, non-CLL type. Infectious workups including human immunodeficiency virus, rapid plasmin reagent, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, lyme, and cryptococcal antigen were negative.\nFinally, right iliac bone biopsy was done that revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma, GCDFP-15 and GATA-3 positive, indicative of breast carcinoma. Estrogen (ER) positive (90%), progesterone (PR) positive (40%), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)/neu non-amplified IHC 1+, and Ki-67 10%. Tumor markers CA 15-3, CA 27.29, and carcinoembryonic antigen were raised at 85 U/mL, 84.2 U/mL, and 7.1 ng/mL, respectively. She was started with letrozole initially with dexamethasone taper, followed by palliative radiation therapy. The radiation was given to lumbosacral spine with 30 Gy in 10 fractions, which improved her lower back pain. After completion of the radiation therapy, abemaciclib was added to letrozole as the systemic therapy. She showed excellent response to the treatment and her previously seen leptomeningeal enhancements are no longer seen in the follow-up scans (Figure ). She does continue to have sclerotic changes in her bones; however, she deferred from bone-targeted therapy. The patient has been on abemaciclib and letrozole for about two years, her neurological symptoms have improved, and now she has a good quality of life.

He reported three days of non-radiating lumbar back pain and two episodes of non-bloody emesis leading up to this event. His medical history included hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications were metformin, amlodipine, losartan, and atenolol. Initial vital signs revealed heart rate (HR) 75, respiratory rate (RR) 29, blood pressure (BP) 119/62, and oxygen saturation 99% on 2L nasal cannula. Temperature was 36.3\u00b0C.\nPhysical examination was significant for an ill-appearing male patient who was anxious and tachypneic. He also had significant work of breathing with retractions and abdominal breathing. Lungs were clear to auscultation, with no wheezing, rhonchi, or rales. Abdominal exam revealed mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound, guarding, or palpable pulsatile mass. No costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness or midline tenderness was elicited. Neurological exam revealed no focal deficits.\nDue to his presentation and multiple comorbidities we had significant concern for the possible acute coronary syndrome, dissection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. Blood work including complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), lactic acid, troponin, urine analysis (UA) was ordered. CT-angiogram of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also ordered.\nComplete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 20.4 x 103/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 376 x 103/uL. Comprehensive metabolic panel was significant for a sodium of 145 mmol/L, potassium 6.1 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/l, bicarbonate <7 mmol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 67 mg/dl, creatinine 14.7 mg/dL, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, and glucose of 165. Troponin I was <0.012 ng/mL. Initial lactic acid was recorded at 13.9 mmol/L. An arterial blood gas revealed severe anion gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.9, pCO2 of 22.3 mmHg, pO2 of 105.5 mmHg, HCO3 of 5.3 meq/L, and a Base Excess of -24.8 mmol/l. The patient was anuric at this time. Initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR), nonspecific ST abnormalities, vent rate 73, QTC 471. The CT scan revealed an obstructing stone at the left proximal ureteropelvic junction (Figures , ) and at the right ureterovesical junction (Figure ), with resultant bilateral hydronephrosis (Figure ).\nWhile in the ED the patient progressively became hypotensive and was given broad-spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin and Cefepime, due to concern for sepsis and aggressive fluid resuscitation was initiated. The patient did not respond to fluid resuscitation and was started initially on Levophed. In addition, the patient received 100 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate and 2 grams of calcium gluconate for severe metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. Due to the expected clinical decline, the patient was intubated in the emergency department. Critical Care, Nephrology, and Urology were consulted emergently in the ED. After initial stabilization, the patient was taken for immediate bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) placement by Interventional Radiology (IR) and placement of a trialysis catheter for initiation of hemodialysis afterward. Urinalysis from the PCN revealed hematuria, but no evidence of infection.\nAfter successful placement of bilateral PCN, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in critical condition. He was maintained on multiple vasopressors consisting of combinations of norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine, and phenylephrine along with stress dose hydrocortisone. Repeat blood gas and labs revealed a worsening metabolic and lactic acidosis with a repeat pH of 6.7 and a lactic acid of 15.9. The patient was started on hemodialysis with a high bicarbonate dialysate for emergent clearance of hyperkalemia and refractory acidosis. After hemodialysis, the patient\u2019s pH was 7.1, despite a worsening lactic acidosis of 17.0 mmol/L. Overnight the patient was converted to continuous venous-venous hemodialysis, a form of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Within 24 hours the patient\u2019s acidemia corrected and blood pressure stabilized allowing for a de-escalation of vasopressors. A repeat chemistry revealed recovering renal function along with urine production in the nephrostomy tubes. On hospital day 3, the patient was successfully extubated, weaned off all vasopressors, and CRRT was stopped. Blood and urine cultures taken prior to dialysis were negative after five days. On hospital day 6, Urology performed a cystoscopy with bilateral ureteral stent placement and removal of bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. On hospital day 8, the patient had made a remarkable recovery from being critically ill.

However, due to a persisting difficult weaning status, probably related to respiratory muscle weakness, tracheostomy was performed [ventilator settings: pressure support 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O]. Subsequently, the patient showed significant improvement in his physical functions with active SOEB, chair-transfer with the help of 2 physical therapists, and active in-bed cycling against resistance for 20 minutes (). The strategy was to increase pressure support (by 5 cmH2O) during efforts to reinforce exercise training effects, unloading respiratory muscles. This strategy along with a highly collaborative patient culminated in his rapid improvement in physical function (MRC-SS 58/60, physical function ICU test score 10/12, walking distance 10 m), although he was still experiencing fatigue, inspiratory muscle weakness (maximal inspiratory pressure of \u221245 cmH2O) and dysphagia upon his transfer to a step-down unit.\n", "topic": "select most likely diagnosis", "keypoint_data": {"keypoint_data": {"retrieved_kp_score": 56.5, "retrieved_keypoints": "Level0: Multisystem Processes & DisordersLevel1: Abnormal Processes: Health and Health Maintenance, Screening, Diagnosis, Management, Risks, PrognosisLevel2: Signs, symptoms, and ill-defined disorders: arthralgias; abdominal pain; chest pain; cough; dizziness, light-headedness, syncope, including breath-holding spells with syncope; dyspnea, shortness of breath; edema, anasarca; fatigue; fever of unknown origin; hemoptysis; pain management (in a nonaddiction, nonpalliative-care setting); joint pain; lymphedema; palpitations; pruritus; unexpected weight gain/weight loss | 480", "keypoint_gpt4_output": "Keypoint: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and its management"}}}

He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 the following day but continued to deteriorate resulting in severe ARDS, intubation, and ICU admission. Despite repeated proning, gas exchange did not improve sufficiently and the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days. After sedation was stopped, the patient continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or to follow commands. Physical therapy therefore focused on perception training, movement exercises, airway-clearing techniques, dysphagia therapy, and mobilization. A first SOEB trial had to be discontinued due to hemodynamic instability. Instead, the patient was positioned in a side-edge position (), which he tolerated better and where an intensive exercise training including trunk and head control was conducted. Nevertheless, muscle tone and strength remained severely reduced, particularly on his hemiplegic side, and a second SOEB trial failed again. Physical therapy was also limited because of reduced self-activity and suspected impaired perception and visual acuity. Consequently, occupational therapy was involved to create a basis of communication, to support functional initiation of upper limb movements, and to integrate perception-training into activities of daily living. Currently, the patient tolerates spontaneous breathing trials, shows signs of being alert during therapy, but cannot communicate.

He reported three days of non-radiating lumbar back pain and two episodes of non-bloody emesis leading up to this event. His medical history included hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications were metformin, amlodipine, losartan, and atenolol. Initial vital signs revealed heart rate (HR) 75, respiratory rate (RR) 29, blood pressure (BP) 119/62, and oxygen saturation 99% on 2L nasal cannula. Temperature was 36.3\u00b0C.\nPhysical examination was significant for an ill-appearing male patient who was anxious and tachypneic. He also had significant work of breathing with retractions and abdominal breathing. Lungs were clear to auscultation, with no wheezing, rhonchi, or rales. Abdominal exam revealed mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound, guarding, or palpable pulsatile mass. No costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness or midline tenderness was elicited. Neurological exam revealed no focal deficits.\nDue to his presentation and multiple comorbidities we had significant concern for the possible acute coronary syndrome, dissection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. Blood work including complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), lactic acid, troponin, urine analysis (UA) was ordered. CT-angiogram of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also ordered.\nComplete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 20.4 x 103/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 376 x 103/uL. Comprehensive metabolic panel was significant for a sodium of 145 mmol/L, potassium 6.1 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/l, bicarbonate <7 mmol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 67 mg/dl, creatinine 14.7 mg/dL, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, and glucose of 165. Troponin I was <0.012 ng/mL. Initial lactic acid was recorded at 13.9 mmol/L. An arterial blood gas revealed severe anion gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.9, pCO2 of 22.3 mmHg, pO2 of 105.5 mmHg, HCO3 of 5.3 meq/L, and a Base Excess of -24.8 mmol/l. The patient was anuric at this time. Initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR), nonspecific ST abnormalities, vent rate 73, QTC 471. The CT scan revealed an obstructing stone at the left proximal ureteropelvic junction (Figures , ) and at the right ureterovesical junction (Figure ), with resultant bilateral hydronephrosis (Figure ).\nWhile in the ED the patient progressively became hypotensive and was given broad-spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin and Cefepime, due to concern for sepsis and aggressive fluid resuscitation was initiated. The patient did not respond to fluid resuscitation and was started initially on Levophed. In addition, the patient received 100 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate and 2 grams of calcium gluconate for severe metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. Due to the expected clinical decline, the patient was intubated in the emergency department. Critical Care, Nephrology, and Urology were consulted emergently in the ED. After initial stabilization, the patient was taken for immediate bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) placement by Interventional Radiology (IR) and placement of a trialysis catheter for initiation of hemodialysis afterward. Urinalysis from the PCN revealed hematuria, but no evidence of infection.\nAfter successful placement of bilateral PCN, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in critical condition. He was maintained on multiple vasopressors consisting of combinations of norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine, and phenylephrine along with stress dose hydrocortisone. Repeat blood gas and labs revealed a worsening metabolic and lactic acidosis with a repeat pH of 6.7 and a lactic acid of 15.9. The patient was started on hemodialysis with a high bicarbonate dialysate for emergent clearance of hyperkalemia and refractory acidosis. After hemodialysis, the patient\u2019s pH was 7.1, despite a worsening lactic acidosis of 17.0 mmol/L. Overnight the patient was converted to continuous venous-venous hemodialysis, a form of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Within 24 hours the patient\u2019s acidemia corrected and blood pressure stabilized allowing for a de-escalation of vasopressors. A repeat chemistry revealed recovering renal function along with urine production in the nephrostomy tubes. On hospital day 3, the patient was successfully extubated, weaned off all vasopressors, and CRRT was stopped. Blood and urine cultures taken prior to dialysis were negative after five days. On hospital day 6, Urology performed a cystoscopy with bilateral ureteral stent placement and removal of bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes.

Physical examination showed abdominal distension and diffuse tenderness with the presence of prominent superficial abdominal veins. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with contrast was obtained immediately. The CT showed an occlusive thrombus of the IVC extending from the renal veins to the level of the cavoatrial junction. Thrombus was also observed in the portal vein, and multiple subcutaneous varicosities were found. Initially, a plan was made to start the patient on anticoagulation, but because of the patient\u2019s history of advanced cirrhosis, large esophageal varices on recent endoscopy, and thrombocytopenia, we concluded that the patient was not a candidate for anticoagulation. Given that the patient had significant abdominal distention with pain that did not improve even after therapeutic paracentesis; we inserted a stent in the IVC to relieve the patient\u2019s pain as a palliative procedure to improve his quality of life.\nRight internal jugular (IJ) and right femoral vein accesses were obtained for the procedure. A 6F pigtail diagnostic catheter was advanced from the right IJ to the right atrium, and contrast was injected into the right atrium that showed an occluded IVC at the junction of the right atrium. Another pigtail catheter was advanced through the right femoral vein and an inferior venogram was performed that showed the IVC was 100% occluded 2 cm above the renal veins (Figures , ).\nA Glidewire advantage was advanced through the right femoral vein but was unable to cross the 100% occluded IVC. Then, a 7-French Swan-Ganz catheter was tried and was successfully advanced through the IVC all the way to the right atrium. A Swan wire was inserted through the Swan-Ganz catheter. Then, a multipurpose catheter was advanced over the Swan wire into the right atrium, and the Swan-Ganz wire was successfully replaced with a Glidewire Advantage (Figure ). Initially, a 9 \u00d7 80 Mustang balloon was used to perform the IVC ballooning; after IVC ballooning; however, the inferior venogram showed no flow to the IVC, which was still 100% occluded. Then, a 22 \u00d7 70 mm Wallstent was advanced via the right femoral vein to the right atrial side. The stent was deployed with a considerable waist in the mid area (Figure ).

He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 the following day but continued to deteriorate resulting in severe ARDS, intubation, and ICU admission. Despite repeated proning, gas exchange did not improve sufficiently and the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days. After sedation was stopped, the patient continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or to follow commands. Physical therapy therefore focused on perception training, movement exercises, airway-clearing techniques, dysphagia therapy, and mobilization. A first SOEB trial had to be discontinued due to hemodynamic instability. Instead, the patient was positioned in a side-edge position (), which he tolerated better and where an intensive exercise training including trunk and head control was conducted. Nevertheless, muscle tone and strength remained severely reduced, particularly on his hemiplegic side, and a second SOEB trial failed again. Physical therapy was also limited because of reduced self-activity and suspected impaired perception and visual acuity. Consequently, occupational therapy was involved to create a basis of communication, to support functional initiation of upper limb movements, and to integrate perception-training into activities of daily living. Currently, the patient tolerates spontaneous breathing trials, shows signs of being alert during therapy, but cannot communicate.

At presentation an erythroderma involving >90% of the integument was predominant (). Computer tomography (CT) scans showed enlarged axillary, inguinal and cervical lymph nodes. The complete blood counts showed a leukocytosis of 24,300/\u00b5l. Flow cytometry of the pb revealed 11,664 S\u00e9zary cells/\u00b5l with CD4+CD7- phenotype and with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 85.5. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate confirmed CD30 positivity with expression of 7% in S\u00e9zary cells. Polymerase chain reaction of pb confirmed the clonality in T-cell receptor beta and gamma showing monoclonal V\u03b2-\u03b22 and two clonal V\u03b31-8-J\u03b31.1 and 2.1 rearrangements. While conventional cytogenetics showed a normal male karyotype, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) detected the deletion of chromosome 17p in 22 of 200 interphases with deletion of TP53 gene. Immunohistochemistry of both trephine biopsy () and skin histology revealed infiltrations with S\u00e9zary cells (). The skin histology also confirmed CD30 positivity with 5-10%, and the diagnosis was revised to SS.\nThe diagnosis was thus revised to S\u00e9zary Syndrome in Stage IVA (pT4 Nx M0 B2) according to the updated classification of International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the European Organization of Research and Treatment (EORTC) ().\nSubsequently, successive therapies with 3,000,000 IU interferon alpha three times weekly for 6 months, combined with 10 mg/m2 methotrexate (MTX) and 19 courses ECP including bexarotene showed no improvement.\nSix months prior to alloHSCT an antibody-conjugate treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV) was administered. The patient received five courses, which led to an improvement of skin lesions and their reduction to about 30% of body surface. CT scans showed no further progression of the lymph nodes, the CD4:CD8 ratio was 76.7 with 63.5% S\u00e9zary cells in the flow-cytometry, confirming stable disease according to the EORTC and ISCL classification (, ).\nDue to preexisting comorbidities, we performed an alloHSCT from an unrelated HLA identical (10/10) and cytomegaly virus matched (recipient and donor IgG positive) 30 year old male donor with non-myeloablative conditioning (fludarabine 30 mg/m\u00b2 body surface area on d-4 to -2 and total body irradiation with 2 Gy on day -1) followed by infusion of pb stem cells (). Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A from d-1 (blood target level 200 ng/ml) and mycophenolate mofetil (3x1000 mg per day). The patient received a total of 6.6x106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight, 1.1x108 CD3+ cells/kg body weight and 0.2x108 CD16+ cells/kg body weight. In the absence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), mycophenolate-mofetil was tapered 500 mg every 14 days from day 40 and discontinued on day 74 while cyclosporine A was tapered from day +56 and discontinued on d+196.\nThe restaging on day +30 and +90 after alloHSCT showed residual infiltration of SS cells in the FACS analysis of the bone marrow (13 and 5% of all WBC, respectively) and chimerism of 70 and 93% on sorted CD3+ cells.

{"clinical_note": "A 64-year-old Caucasian male smoker with a horseshoe kidney with a history of open pyelolithotomy 18 years ago, presented to King Abdulaziz Medical City in mid-2020 with a report from another hospital stating that he developed gross hematuria six months prior, which was treated as a urinary tract infection. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed in that hospital, showing a horseshoe kidney with severe left hydronephrosis and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, with the largest one located in the posterior part of the left renal artery measuring 4.7 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 2.6 cm. Additionally, there were multiple stones (Figures , , ). Urine culture was performed and revealed that various organisms were isolated (10-100,000 CFU/ml). Urinalysis showed a small amount of blood with a moderate presence of leukocytes and a trace protein.\nAt the end of 2020, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI showed a horseshoe kidney with chronic hydronephrosis of the left kidney and a large mass within it centrally with further satellite lesions, which all likely represent UC and associated lymphadenopathy along the para-aortic chain (Figure ). Additionally, a finding of chronic pancreatitis was noted with dilated duct and stone, for which the patient was referred to the gastroenterology department. Furthermore, a bone scan and chest CT were performed, and no significant abnormality or metastasis was found.\nAfter a couple of days, the patient presented to the emergency department with non-radiating progressive lower abdominal and left colicky flank pain for three days with hematuria and constipation with fullness. The patient denied any history of fever or vomiting. There were no other genitourinary symptoms, scrotal pain, or change in the level of consciousness. Vital signs were measured and were as follows: blood pressure, 151/71 mmHg; heart rate, 109; respiratory rate, 20; and temperature, 37.1\u2103. The weight of the patient was 48.4 kg, and height was 166 cm. The chest was clear, while the abdomen was tender over the left side and the left flank area. Lab results were obtained (Table ). Urine culture was performed and showed more than 100,000 CFU/ml of Staphylococcus aureus being isolated. Abdomen and pelvis CT was performed to rule out any intra-abdominal collections, but it was negative. The urology team was consulted for his chief complaint, as his case is already known to them. On examination, they found that the abdomen was soft with lower left quadrant tenderness. They concluded that the pain was less likely to be from the left kidney as the CT findings were stable. Furthermore, based on the urine culture result, the patient was prescribed Bactrim and was given an appointment for admission a week later to perform a flexible ureteroscopy with biopsy.\nAfter one week, the patient underwent ureteroscopy with cytology and culture based on his MRI findings. Cystoscopy and retrograde pyelography showed normal bilateral ureters. However, the left kidney was severely dilated, and cloudy urine was noticed from the left ureteric orifice. Thus, culture and cytology were taken; then, a double-J (DJ) stent was inserted (Figure ). Urine culture was positive for S. aureus, and the patient was already on Bactrim. The urine cytology result was negative for high-grade UC, but benign urothelial cells, squamous cells, inflammatory cells, and red blood cells were present. Furthermore, since cancer could not be excluded, the patient was discharged and given an appointment for a left nephroureterectomy.\nAfter two weeks, the patient presented to the emergency room complaining of left flank pain for five days with hematuria and constipation. The urology team was again consulted and suspected urinary tract infection at the site of the double J stent. Thus, the patient was admitted, given antibiotics, and was planned for the open left radical nephroureterectomy the following day. The surgery was successfully performed, and samples were sent to the histopathology department.\nMacroscopic examination showed a fairly-circumscribed, bulging, gray-white mass located mainly in the renal pelvis and mostly replacing the entire kidney. It measured 14 cm in maximum dimension. The mass cut sections were homogenous with areas of necrosis, with a stent present (Figure ). The mass is away from margins and Gerota\u2019s fascia by 2 cm. The remaining kidney parenchyma showed dilated cystic spaces containing multiple brownstones. Furthermore, the resected left renal hilum lymph node measured 7 cm in maximum dimension. Microscopically, the tumor showed urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis with dysplasia in the background. In addition, the tumor had a predominance of sarcomatoid differentiation. Furthermore, foci of squamous formation containing keratin formation, and other foci of glands with mucinous and goblet cells lining were seen. The tumor was focally extending to the perinephric fat. Margins were negative; however, the ureteric margin showed dysplasia. The left renal hilum lymph node was positive for metastatic carcinoma. The final diagnosis based on the examination was UC of the renal pelvis with sarcomatoid differentiation (70%) and unusual histological differentiation including squamous (25%), and glandular (<5%) (Figure ). In addition, there was no outside pathology confirmation done. Immunohistochemistry profile was positive for CK7, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), vimentin, and focally for smooth muscle antigen (SMA). However, it was negative for desmin, cytokeratin (AE1/3), and GATA-3 (Figure ).\nAccording to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), the pathological stage is pT3N2Mx. After a couple of days, the patient underwent a cystourethrogram, and there was no leak. The patient was eventually discharged in good health the next day and was given an appointment. The plan of the oncology team was to start adjuvant chemotherapy and perform positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) for the suspicious distant lymphadenopathy. In addition, CT, cystoscopy, and urine cytology were supposed to be done regularly. However, the patient missed the appointment, so the current status of the patient is unknown.\n", "topic": "follow-up or monitoring approach regarding the management plan", "keypoint_data": {"keypoint_data": {"retrieved_kp_score": 58.0, "retrieved_keypoints": "Level0: Renal & Urinary SystemLevel1: Abnormal Processes: Health and Health Maintenance, Screening, Diagnosis, Management, Risks, PrognosisLevel2: Congenital disorders: double ureters/ureteral duplication/double collecting system; horseshoe kidney; hydronephrosis/reflux; renal agenesis, renal hypoplasia, renal dysplasia; single kidney | 459", "keypoint_gpt4_output": "Keypoint: Management and follow-up of hydronephrosis in horseshoe kidney."}}}

Fifteen months prior to the current presentation, the patient was noted to have a grade 1 endometrial adenoma but was not considered a good surgical candidate due to multiple comorbidities. Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to her long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially. Her only treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy. She eventually underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain. The patient denied any prior history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Her bleeding was described as one large episode of bright red blood per rectum associated with blood clots. She denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or melena. The most recent colonoscopy was performed four months ago and revealed three diminutive polyps in the transverse colon with pathology confirming tubular adenoma.\nHer physical examination was significant for mild left-sided abdominal tenderness but was otherwise unremarkable. Rectal examination was notable for nonbleeding hemorrhoids and no visible blood. Blood work revealed white blood cells of 14.3k/uL (normal range 4.3-10.0 k/uL) and hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL (normal range 11.8-14.8 g/dL), which is similar to the patient\u2019s baseline. Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 and blood urea nitrogen was elevated to 39. International normalized ratio was 2.0.

Biopsies were obtained with cold forceps for histology and the proximal and distal margins of the mass were tattooed. Histology showed invasive and moderately differentiated carcinoma without visible goblet cells. Given the patient\u2019s history of endometrial cancer, immunohistochemistry was performed and was consistent with an endometrial (endometrioid subtype) primary.\nPan-computed tomography was negative for any obvious distant disease.

{"clinical_note": "A 33-year-old female with no prior medical comorbidities, who recently gave birth to a healthy girl child four months ago, was brought to the emergency department with sudden onset weakness of both upper and lower limbs that started four days prior and rapidly progressed to a state of quadriplegia. She was conscious and obeyed simple commands with eyes and mouth; however, she had severe dysarthria. She had bilateral facial palsy and bulbar palsy. She had flaccid, hyporeflexic, pure motor quadriplegia with limbs showing only a subtle withdrawal flicker to pain. MRI of the brain revealed hyperintensity in the central pons in diffusion-weighted images (Figure ), T2-weighted images (Figure ), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (Figure ) without abnormal contrast enhancement (Figure ), consistent with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) (Figure ).\nThe biochemical analysis showed hypernatremia while the remaining electrolytes were normal. The rest of the blood workup was unremarkable. Relatives denied an antecedent history of hyponatremia with rapid correction. The patient was started on sodium correction and was given five days intravenous (IV) pulse methylprednisolone 1 g/day to stabilize the blood-brain barrier. The patient recovered significantly to normal power. She was then considered to have idiopathic hypernatremic osmotic demyelination and was discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 0.\nOne year later, she presented to the neurology department with a one-week history of generalized fatigue, diffuse myalgias, and three days history of rapidly progressive weakness of all four limbs making her wheelchair-bound one day before the presentation. Her initial vital signs were unremarkable. She was noted to have a pure motor flaccid symmetric quadriparesis with proximal more than distal weakness and generalized hyporeflexia. Clinical examination of other systems was normal. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) done on day three of onset of weakness demonstrated reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes of bilateral tibial and peroneal nerves with absent F waves and H reflexes. CMAP of tested nerves in upper limbs showed preserved amplitudes with normal distal latency and absent F waves. There were no conduction blocks. The sensory conduction study of all the tested nerves in all four limbs was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis did not show albumin-cytological dissociation. Therefore, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) or hypokalemia-related electrophysiological abnormalities were considered. A basic metabolic panel revealed severe hypokalemia (potassium 2.2 mEq/L). Arterial blood gas (ABG) and 24-hour urine analysis showed metabolic acidosis, consistent with renal tubular acidosis type-1 (distal). Autoimmune workup was positive anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies. The biopsy of the minor salivary gland was pathognomonic. The patient was diagnosed with pSS according to the new classification criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Overall clinical, electrical, and biochemical data suggest the presence of renal tubular acidosis with secondary hypokalemia-related quadriparesis due to pSS.\nThe patient was given intravenous (IV) potassium supplementation through a peripheral vein at a rate not exceeding 10 mEq/hour and subsequently was shifted to oral liquid formulation in the form of a syrup. Oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation was given at a dose of 1 mEq/kg/day for renal tubular acidosis. With potassium correction, there was a rapid recovery in the power of all four limbs within 24 hours of admission. The patient was initiated on 1 mg/kg/day of oral prednisolone and was referred to a rheumatologist for further management.

{"clinical_note": "\nA 71-year-old African American female with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and osteoarthritis initially presented to the emergency room with intermittent bilateral hand tingling and numbness, which was gradual in onset over months. Her symptoms were associated with seeing red spots and experiencing a burning sensation in the bottom of her feet. She was concerned because she was having difficulty picking up objects due to her hand symptoms. Her basic lab work was unremarkable, and she was provided gabapentin and magnesium oxide with close follow-up with her primary care physician. At follow-up, she complained of one to two months of unsteady gait as well as increased confusion. Her reported medications included losartan and metformin. Physical exam revealed normal pupils with reaction and accommodation (3mm diameter bilaterally), no cranial nerve deficits, normal strength throughout, and normal reflexes throughout except for diminished reflexes in the bilateral knees and ankles. She endorsed blurry vision; no ophthalmologic exam was performed, but she was able to read a name badge from one foot away. She additionally was found to have decreased vibratory and proprioception in a stocking pattern as well as a wide-based and unsteady gait.\nTo investigate further, tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), folate, B12, and rapid plasma regain (RPR) titer were ordered. Her TSH, folate, and B12 levels were within normal limits, but her RPR titer was reactive at 1:1. A subsequent reflex Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) test was reactive. She was told to go to the hospital for further workup and treatment. Further questioning revealed that she had had two sexual partners in her life, both ex-husbands. However, she noted that her husbands committed adultery several times and that she was not currently sexually active; her last sexual encounter occurred several years ago. She endorsed that she did not notice any ulcers or skin lesions, and she had not been treated for syphilis. During hospitalization, she received a lumbar puncture that revealed a negative venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test result. Her glucose level (61 mg/dL) and white blood cell level (3 x 109/L) were normal, but her CSF protein level was markedly elevated at 156 mg/dL. Due to her exposure history, a constellation of symptoms, RPR titer with positive TP-PA, and protein elevation in her CSF, our infectious disease colleagues believed that she contracted syphilis earlier in life from one of her husbands and was never treated. The decision was made to start treatment with intravenous (IV) penicillin (24 million units, continuous infusion) for two weeks. At follow-up, her vision had improved and she no longer had sensory symptoms in her hands. Her gait was somewhat improved, but still unsteady, and she still had burning pain in her feet. Her physical exam showed improvement in sensation in hands and improved gait; all other neurological exam was unchanged. It was thought that neuropathy in feet could have been due to poorly controlled diabetes; although, no formal nerve conduction study was pursued.\n", "topic": "select most likely diagnosis", "keypoint_data": {"keypoint_data": {"retrieved_kp_score": 52.1875, "retrieved_keypoints": "Level0: Multisystem Processes & DisordersLevel1: Abnormal Processes: Health and Health Maintenance, Screening, Diagnosis, Management, Risks, PrognosisLevel2: Signs, symptoms, and ill-defined disorders: arthralgias; abdominal pain; chest pain; cough; dizziness, light-headedness, syncope, including breath-holding spells with syncope; dyspnea, shortness of breath; edema, anasarca; fatigue; fever of unknown origin; hemoptysis; pain management (in a nonaddiction, nonpalliative-care setting); joint pain; lymphedema; palpitations; pruritus; unexpected weight gain/weight loss | 480", "keypoint_gpt4_output": "Keypoint: Neurosyphilis diagnosis and management"}}}

He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 the following day but continued to deteriorate resulting in severe ARDS, intubation, and ICU admission. Despite repeated proning, gas exchange did not improve sufficiently and the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days. After sedation was stopped, the patient continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or to follow commands. Physical therapy therefore focused on perception training, movement exercises, airway-clearing techniques, dysphagia therapy, and mobilization. A first SOEB trial had to be discontinued due to hemodynamic instability. Instead, the patient was positioned in a side-edge position (), which he tolerated better and where an intensive exercise training including trunk and head control was conducted. Nevertheless, muscle tone and strength remained severely reduced, particularly on his hemiplegic side, and a second SOEB trial failed again. Physical therapy was also limited because of reduced self-activity and suspected impaired perception and visual acuity. Consequently, occupational therapy was involved to create a basis of communication, to support functional initiation of upper limb movements, and to integrate perception-training into activities of daily living. Currently, the patient tolerates spontaneous breathing trials, shows signs of being alert during therapy, but cannot communicate.

At presentation an erythroderma involving >90% of the integument was predominant (). Computer tomography (CT) scans showed enlarged axillary, inguinal and cervical lymph nodes. The complete blood counts showed a leukocytosis of 24,300/\u00b5l. Flow cytometry of the pb revealed 11,664 S\u00e9zary cells/\u00b5l with CD4+CD7- phenotype and with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 85.5. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate confirmed CD30 positivity with expression of 7% in S\u00e9zary cells. Polymerase chain reaction of pb confirmed the clonality in T-cell receptor beta and gamma showing monoclonal V\u03b2-\u03b22 and two clonal V\u03b31-8-J\u03b31.1 and 2.1 rearrangements. While conventional cytogenetics showed a normal male karyotype, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) detected the deletion of chromosome 17p in 22 of 200 interphases with deletion of TP53 gene. Immunohistochemistry of both trephine biopsy () and skin histology revealed infiltrations with S\u00e9zary cells (). The skin histology also confirmed CD30 positivity with 5-10%, and the diagnosis was revised to SS.\nThe diagnosis was thus revised to S\u00e9zary Syndrome in Stage IVA (pT4 Nx M0 B2) according to the updated classification of International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the European Organization of Research and Treatment (EORTC) ().\nSubsequently, successive therapies with 3,000,000 IU interferon alpha three times weekly for 6 months, combined with 10 mg/m2 methotrexate (MTX) and 19 courses ECP including bexarotene showed no improvement.\nSix months prior to alloHSCT an antibody-conjugate treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV) was administered. The patient received five courses, which led to an improvement of skin lesions and their reduction to about 30% of body surface. CT scans showed no further progression of the lymph nodes, the CD4:CD8 ratio was 76.7 with 63.5% S\u00e9zary cells in the flow-cytometry, confirming stable disease according to the EORTC and ISCL classification (, ).\nDue to preexisting comorbidities, we performed an alloHSCT from an unrelated HLA identical (10/10) and cytomegaly virus matched (recipient and donor IgG positive) 30 year old male donor with non-myeloablative conditioning (fludarabine 30 mg/m\u00b2 body surface area on d-4 to -2 and total body irradiation with 2 Gy on day -1) followed by infusion of pb stem cells (). Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A from d-1 (blood target level 200 ng/ml) and mycophenolate mofetil (3x1000 mg per day). The patient received a total of 6.6x106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight, 1.1x108 CD3+ cells/kg body weight and 0.2x108 CD16+ cells/kg body weight. In the absence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), mycophenolate-mofetil was tapered 500 mg every 14 days from day 40 and discontinued on day 74 while cyclosporine A was tapered from day +56 and discontinued on d+196.\nThe restaging on day +30 and +90 after alloHSCT showed residual infiltration of SS cells in the FACS analysis of the bone marrow (13 and 5% of all WBC, respectively) and chimerism of 70 and 93% on sorted CD3+ cells. The CT scan on day +90 after alloHSCT confirmed the persistent lymphadenopathy. On day + 172 after alloHCT a complete hematological remission (CR) with no infiltration of SS in bone marrow trephine biopsy, 100% chimerism on sorted CD3 positive cells from bone marrow aspirate and normal pb CD4:CD 8 ratio was documented, thus confirming graft-vs-S\u00e9zary effect (). The CT scan showed no lymph node enlargements. The inspection of the skin revealed no suspect lesions.\nAfter discontinuation of immunosuppression the patient developed chronic GvHD of the ocular mucosa and the liver according to national institutes of health (NIH) criteria () on day 277 and required immunosuppressive treatment with intermediate dosage of methylprednisolone, cyclosporine A and mycophenolic acid. The immunosuppression could have been slowly tapered to 720 mg mycophenolic acid b.i.d, 5 mg prednisolone and autologous plasma eye drops as previously described (, ). Furthermore, since September 2021 ruxolitinib was added to the GvHD treatment ().

Given that the patient had significant abdominal distention with pain that did not improve even after therapeutic paracentesis; we inserted a stent in the IVC to relieve the patient\u2019s pain as a palliative procedure to improve his quality of life.\nRight internal jugular (IJ) and right femoral vein accesses were obtained for the procedure. A 6F pigtail diagnostic catheter was advanced from the right IJ to the right atrium, and contrast was injected into the right atrium that showed an occluded IVC at the junction of the right atrium. Another pigtail catheter was advanced through the right femoral vein and an inferior venogram was performed that showed the IVC was 100% occluded 2 cm above the renal veins (Figures , ).\nA Glidewire advantage was advanced through the right femoral vein but was unable to cross the 100% occluded IVC. Then, a 7-French Swan-Ganz catheter was tried and was successfully advanced through the IVC all the way to the right atrium. A Swan wire was inserted through the Swan-Ganz catheter. Then, a multipurpose catheter was advanced over the Swan wire into the right atrium, and the Swan-Ganz wire was successfully replaced with a Glidewire Advantage (Figure ). Initially, a 9 \u00d7 80 Mustang balloon was used to perform the IVC ballooning; after IVC ballooning; however, the inferior venogram showed no flow to the IVC, which was still 100% occluded. Then, a 22 \u00d7 70 mm Wallstent was advanced via the right femoral vein to the right atrial side. The stent was deployed with a considerable waist in the mid area (Figure ). After stent placement, an 18 \u00d7 60 Boston Scientific esophageal balloon was successfully used to post-dilate the stent (Figure ).\nThe final venogram (Figures , ) and digital subtraction imaging mode showed excellent flow in the IVC to the right atrium. Small clots floating around at the lower edge of the stent above the renal artery were successfully removed with a 7-Fr snare. Usually, if IVC occlusion is of thrombosis in etiology anticoagulation is advised after venous stent placement, since our patient had an advanced liver failure with elevated INR, anticoagulation was not started [].\n", "topic": "appropriate surgical management", "keypoint_data": {"keypoint_data": {"retrieved_kp_score": 60.09375, "retrieved_keypoints": "Level0: Nervous System & Special SensesLevel1: Abnormal Processes: Health and Health Maintenance, Screening, Diagnosis, Management, Risks, PrognosisLevel2: Cerebrovascular disease: arteriovenous malformations, ectatic cerebral vessels; transient ischemic attack; stroke, thrombotic: cerebral artery occlusion/cerebral infarction; stroke, embolic: cerebral embolism; stroke: intracerebral hemorrhage, including subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic intracranial hemorrhage; cerebral artery aneurysm; carotid artery stenosis/atherosclerosis/occlusion/dissection; vertebral artery deficiency/dissection; subclavian steal syndrome; vascular dementia; hypertensive encephalopathy; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; venous sinus thrombosis | 61", "keypoint_gpt4_output": "Keypoint: Management of Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) thrombosis in the context of advanced liver disease"}}}

{"clinical_note": "A 64-year-old Caucasian male smoker with a horseshoe kidney with a history of open pyelolithotomy 18 years ago, presented to King Abdulaziz Medical City in mid-2020 with a report from another hospital stating that he developed gross hematuria six months prior, which was treated as a urinary tract infection. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed in that hospital, showing a horseshoe kidney with severe left hydronephrosis and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, with the largest one located in the posterior part of the left renal artery measuring 4.7 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 2.6 cm. Additionally, there were multiple stones (Figures , , ). Urine culture was performed and revealed that various organisms were isolated (10-100,000 CFU/ml). Urinalysis showed a small amount of blood with a moderate presence of leukocytes and a trace protein.\nAt the end of 2020, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI showed a horseshoe kidney with chronic hydronephrosis of the left kidney and a large mass within it centrally with further satellite lesions, which all likely represent UC and associated lymphadenopathy along the para-aortic chain (Figure ). Additionally, a finding of chronic pancreatitis was noted with dilated duct and stone, for which the patient was referred to the gastroenterology department. Furthermore, a bone scan and chest CT were performed, and no significant abnormality or metastasis was found.\nAfter a couple of days, the patient presented to the emergency department with non-radiating progressive lower abdominal and left colicky flank pain for three days with hematuria and constipation with fullness. The patient denied any history of fever or vomiting. There were no other genitourinary symptoms, scrotal pain, or change in the level of consciousness. Vital signs were measured and were as follows: blood pressure, 151/71 mmHg; heart rate, 109; respiratory rate, 20; and temperature, 37.1\u2103. The weight of the patient was 48.4 kg, and height was 166 cm. The chest was clear, while the abdomen was tender over the left side and the left flank area. Lab results were obtained (Table ). Urine culture was performed and showed more than 100,000 CFU/ml of Staphylococcus aureus being isolated. Abdomen and pelvis CT was performed to rule out any intra-abdominal collections, but it was negative. The urology team was consulted for his chief complaint, as his case is already known to them. On examination, they found that the abdomen was soft with lower left quadrant tenderness. They concluded that the pain was less likely to be from the left kidney as the CT findings were stable. Furthermore, based on the urine culture result, the patient was prescribed Bactrim and was given an appointment for admission a week later to perform a flexible ureteroscopy with biopsy.\nAfter one week, the patient underwent ureteroscopy with cytology and culture based on his MRI findings. Cystoscopy and retrograde pyelography showed normal bilateral ureters. However, the left kidney was severely dilated, and cloudy urine was noticed from the left ureteric orifice. Thus, culture and cytology were taken; then, a double-J (DJ) stent was inserted (Figure ). Urine culture was positive for S. aureus, and the patient was already on Bactrim. The urine cytology result was negative for high-grade UC, but benign urothelial cells, squamous cells, inflammatory cells, and red blood cells were present. Furthermore, since cancer could not be excluded, the patient was discharged and given an appointment for a left nephroureterectomy.\nAfter two weeks, the patient presented to the emergency room complaining of left flank pain for five days with hematuria and constipation. The urology team was again consulted and suspected urinary tract infection at the site of the double J stent. Thus, the patient was admitted, given antibiotics, and was planned for the open left radical nephroureterectomy the following day. The surgery was successfully performed, and samples were sent to the histopathology department.\nMacroscopic examination showed a fairly-circumscribed, bulging, gray-white mass located mainly in the renal pelvis and mostly replacing the entire kidney. It measured 14 cm in maximum dimension. The mass cut sections were homogenous with areas of necrosis, with a stent present (Figure ). The mass is away from margins and Gerota\u2019s fascia by 2 cm. The remaining kidney parenchyma showed dilated cystic spaces containing multiple brownstones. Furthermore, the resected left renal hilum lymph node measured 7 cm in maximum dimension. Microscopically, the tumor showed urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis with dysplasia in the background. In addition, the tumor had a predominance of sarcomatoid differentiation. Furthermore, foci of squamous formation containing keratin formation, and other foci of glands with mucinous and goblet cells lining were seen. The tumor was focally extending to the perinephric fat. Margins were negative; however, the ureteric margin showed dysplasia. The left renal hilum lymph node was positive for metastatic carcinoma. The final diagnosis based on the examination was UC of the renal pelvis with sarcomatoid differentiation (70%) and unusual histological differentiation including squamous (25%), and glandular (<5%) (Figure ). In addition, there was no outside pathology confirmation done. Immunohistochemistry profile was positive for CK7, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), vimentin, and focally for smooth muscle antigen (SMA). However, it was negative for desmin, cytokeratin (AE1/3), and GATA-3 (Figure ).\nAccording to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), the pathological stage is pT3N2Mx. After a couple of days, the patient underwent a cystourethrogram, and there was no leak. The patient was eventually discharged in good health the next day and was given an appointment. The plan of the oncology team was to start adjuvant chemotherapy and perform positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) for the suspicious distant lymphadenopathy. In addition, CT, cystoscopy, and urine cytology were supposed to be done regularly. However, the patient missed the appointment, so the current status of the patient is unknown.\n", "topic": "most appropriate management of selected conditions", "keypoint_data": {"keypoint_data": {"retrieved_kp_score": 58.0, "retrieved_keypoints": "Level0: Renal & Urinary SystemLevel1: Abnormal Processes: Health and Health Maintenance, Screening, Diagnosis, Management, Risks, PrognosisLevel2: Congenital disorders: double ureters/ureteral duplication/double collecting system; horseshoe kidney; hydronephrosis/reflux; renal agenesis, renal hypoplasia, renal dysplasia; single kidney | 459", "keypoint_gpt4_output": "Keypoint: Management of horseshoe kidney with hydronephrosis and urinary tract infections."}}}
{"clinical_note": "\nWe report a case of a 45-year-old woman, a non-smoker, treated for type II diabetes under insulin and primary hyperparathyroidism. Her medical history dates back to 2006 with an infiltrated nodule associated with ulcers that grew gradually in her right thigh. The patient underwent surgery with an anatomopathological study. Skin biopsy objectified ulcerated epidermotropic dermo-hypodermal tumor proliferation whose morphological appearance and immunohistochemical data are in favor of LCH. Langerhans cells present positivity of the anti-PS100 antibody, anti-CD1a antibody, and anti-Ki67 antibody (60%), and negativity of the anti-CD68 antibody. The patient subsequently received 25 sessions of radiotherapy followed by six courses of chemotherapy with a low dose of oral methotrexate. After these treatments, skin lesions are stable. In 2020, the patient complained of an increase in skin lesions, with the appearance of several infiltrating nodules, scaling, crusted papules, and ulcerated plaques. The patient received chemotherapy as single-system LCH (SS-LCH) based on methotrexate, associated with prednisone and vinblastine, with the obtainment of stable response and limited regression of the lesions. After two courses, the patient was lost to follow-up. One year later, the oncologist referred the patient to the hematology department for a major increase in skin lesions, with the appearance of new ones on her thigh. Dermatological examination found ulcers and necrotic lesions, purplish, well-limited, of variable size, not painful, not warm to the skin, and localized to the right thigh. The mucous membranes and integuments were unharmed (Figure ).\nFurthermore, the examination found an afebrile, obese patient (body mass index (BMI) at 44.8). Abdominal and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable. The physical examination did not find any tumoral syndromes, and the patient did not present have B signs (fever, weight loss, and night sweats). A complete assessment was carried out in favor of a cutaneous location without visceral involvement. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen was normal. Extensive investigation revealed no systemic involvement, central nervous system (CNS) evaluation was not done, serum thyroid hormone levels were normal, endocrine workup was performed, including cortisolemia, and parathormone assessment were done in favor of primary hyperparathyroidism. A skin biopsy was performed. The microscopic examination revealed a cutaneous tissue with an infiltrate of large cells involving the dermis and realizing an epidermotropism. The infiltrate was composed of atypical cells with abundant, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, irregular and elongated or lobed nuclei with prominent nuclear grooves and folds, fine chromatin, and indistinct nucleoli. Multinucleated giant tumor cells, high cytonuclear atypia, and marked nuclear pleomorphism were seen. The mitotic figures were increased. The neoplastic cells also showed a mixed inflammatory background with variable numbers of reactive lymphocytes, plasma cells, benign histiocytes, and eosinophils associated (Figure ).\nThe immunohistochemical stains had shown a diffuse strong and heterogeneous positivity for CD1a and S100 and variable positivity for CD45. All other markers studied were negative, including CD68, cytokeratins (AE1/AE3), and melanocytic marker (MelanA). The Ki-67 proliferation index was high (50%) (Figure ).\nIn the light of microscopic and phenotypic results, the diagnosis of Langerhans cell sarcoma was confirmed. The patient did not receive any maintenance therapy and she received only two courses of chemotherapy; consequently, the patient was included in the LCH protocol as single-system LCH (SS-LCH), and she received the same chemotherapy combining prednisone (60 mg / m2), high-dose of methotrexate (5000 mg/m2), and vinblastine (10 mg/m2).
