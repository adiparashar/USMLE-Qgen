{"clinical_note": "A healthy 11-year-old girl was presented to the National University of Malaysia (UKM) Paediatric Dental Clinic with a referral for further management of pulp necrosis of an immature lower right second premolar (tooth 45), secondary to the fractured tubercle of dens evaginatus. Two weeks earlier, she had treatment at a general dental clinic for pain related to tooth 45. Tooth 45 had spontaneous and lingering pain following cold and thermal stimuli. The tooth was diagnosed to have symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, and root canal therapy was initiated. The canal was accessed, and pulp extirpation performed before the placement of intracanal nonsetting calcium hydroxide by the general dental practitioner (GDP).\nAt the time of current assessment, her tooth-related symptoms had completely resolved. General oral examination showed the presence of generalised mild gingivitis with a basic periodontal examination (BPE) score of 1 in all sextants. The patient's oral hygiene was fair with a plaque score of 30%. The patient is still in her mixed dentition with the presence of the primary maxillary canines. Her upper dental arch was well aligned, and mild crowding of anterior teeth was noted in the lower arch. Tooth 45 has an occlusal glass ionomer dressing of the access cavity made for the pulp extirpation earlier by the GDP (). Cold and electric pulp sensibility testings showed positive responses to all fully erupted premolars indicative of tooth vitality expect for tooth 45. Tooth 45 also has slight tenderness to percussion. Periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an immature root with convergent open apex and small periapical radiolucency. The pulp space of tooth 45 is of an even width from the coronal to the apical portion (). Based on the assessments, tooth 45 was diagnosed with pulp necrosis secondary to fractured dens evaginatus and symptomatic apical periodontitis.\nOn the day of initial assessment, tooth 45 was isolated with rubber dam after infiltration of local anaesthetic solution (2% lidocaine with 1 : 80000 adrenaline). Pulp chamber was reentered through the previously prepared access cavity. The root canal was exposed and irrigated with saline. After that, the canal was dried with paper points and the tooth working length was estimated with a K-file No. 60. A working length, 2 mm short of the apical opening, was determined (17 mm). The canal was gently prepared with the K-file No. 60 and then irrigated with a copious volume of 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI). After drying the wet canal with paper points, nonsetting calcium hydroxide was placed into the canal and the access cavity was double sealed with Cavit\u2122 3M, USA, and glass ionomer cement (GIC) (Riva Self Cure\u2122 SDI, Australia).\nTwo weeks later, the tooth was reassessed for any signs and symptoms of infection. The tooth was no longer tender to percussion, and there was no indication of infection-related signs and symptoms. After isolation with a rubber dam, the root canal of tooth 45 was reaccessed and irrigated with a copious volume 1.5% NaOCl to remove the nonsetting calcium hydroxide. Then, the canal was irrigated with sterile water and dried with paper points. Subsequently, the canal was irrigated with 17% EDTA (Pulpdent\u2122, Watertown, Massachusetts) for a minute and dried with paper points. Finally, under the guidance of a dental operating microscope (Carl Zeiss Surgical GmbH, S100), the apical region was filled using the EndoSequence (BC RRM-Fast Set Putty, Brasseler, USA) material up to 4 mm thickness to create an apical seal (). The orifice of the root canal was double sealed with a cotton pellet, temporary filling material (Cavit 3M, USA), and GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia).\nOnce again, the root canal was reaccessed two weeks later, irrigated with 1.5% NaOCl, and dried with paper points. Next, the dried canal was obturated with thermoplasticised gutta-perca using the Obtura III Max System (Obtura Spartan\u00ae Endodontics) (). After that, the access cavity was double sealed with GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia) and nanohybrid composite (AURA\u2122 SDI, Australia), respectively.\nFollowing the obturation, tooth 45 was reviewed at three-month and six-month intervals. During both reviews, tooth 45 was asymptomatic. However, at the six-month review, a periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an unexpected finding. The apical root of tooth 45 continued to grow beyond the apexification level with a normal periodontal ligament space and lamina dura. No evidence of periapical radiolucency was noted (). However, regular annual monitoring of tooth 45 is essential to ensure that the coronal seal is intact and no apical complication further arises.", "keypoint": "Dens evaginatus leading to pulp necrosis and symptomatic apical periodontitis", "topic": "the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)", "content_to_fb": [{"context": "An 11-year-old girl had been suffering from a tooth-related ailment for which she was referred to the National University of Malaysia Paediatric Dental Clinic.

{"clinical_note": "A healthy 11-year-old girl was presented to the National University of Malaysia (UKM) Paediatric Dental Clinic with a referral for further management of pulp necrosis of an immature lower right second premolar (tooth 45), secondary to the fractured tubercle of dens evaginatus. Two weeks earlier, she had treatment at a general dental clinic for pain related to tooth 45. Tooth 45 had spontaneous and lingering pain following cold and thermal stimuli. The tooth was diagnosed to have symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, and root canal therapy was initiated. The canal was accessed, and pulp extirpation performed before the placement of intracanal nonsetting calcium hydroxide by the general dental practitioner (GDP).\nAt the time of current assessment, her tooth-related symptoms had completely resolved. General oral examination showed the presence of generalised mild gingivitis with a basic periodontal examination (BPE) score of 1 in all sextants. The patient's oral hygiene was fair with a plaque score of 30%. The patient is still in her mixed dentition with the presence of the primary maxillary canines. Her upper dental arch was well aligned, and mild crowding of anterior teeth was noted in the lower arch. Tooth 45 has an occlusal glass ionomer dressing of the access cavity made for the pulp extirpation earlier by the GDP (). Cold and electric pulp sensibility testings showed positive responses to all fully erupted premolars indicative of tooth vitality expect for tooth 45. Tooth 45 also has slight tenderness to percussion. Periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an immature root with convergent open apex and small periapical radiolucency. The pulp space of tooth 45 is of an even width from the coronal to the apical portion (). Based on the assessments, tooth 45 was diagnosed with pulp necrosis secondary to fractured dens evaginatus and symptomatic apical periodontitis.\nOn the day of initial assessment, tooth 45 was isolated with rubber dam after infiltration of local anaesthetic solution (2% lidocaine with 1 : 80000 adrenaline). Pulp chamber was reentered through the previously prepared access cavity. The root canal was exposed and irrigated with saline. After that, the canal was dried with paper points and the tooth working length was estimated with a K-file No. 60. A working length, 2 mm short of the apical opening, was determined (17 mm). The canal was gently prepared with the K-file No. 60 and then irrigated with a copious volume of 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI). After drying the wet canal with paper points, nonsetting calcium hydroxide was placed into the canal and the access cavity was double sealed with Cavit\u2122 3M, USA, and glass ionomer cement (GIC) (Riva Self Cure\u2122 SDI, Australia).\nTwo weeks later, the tooth was reassessed for any signs and symptoms of infection. The tooth was no longer tender to percussion, and there was no indication of infection-related signs and symptoms. After isolation with a rubber dam, the root canal of tooth 45 was reaccessed and irrigated with a copious volume 1.5% NaOCl to remove the nonsetting calcium hydroxide. Then, the canal was irrigated with sterile water and dried with paper points. Subsequently, the canal was irrigated with 17% EDTA (Pulpdent\u2122, Watertown, Massachusetts) for a minute and dried with paper points.

The orifice of the root canal was double sealed with a cotton pellet, temporary filling material (Cavit 3M, USA), and GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia).\nOnce again, the root canal was reaccessed two weeks later, irrigated with 1.5% NaOCl, and dried with paper points. Next, the dried canal was obturated with thermoplasticised gutta-perca using the Obtura III Max System (Obtura Spartan\u00ae Endodontics) ().

During both reviews, tooth 45 was asymptomatic. However, at the six-month review, a periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an unexpected finding. The apical root of tooth 45 continued to grow beyond the apexification level with a normal periodontal ligament space and lamina dura. No evidence of periapical radiolucency was noted ().

{"clinical_note": "A healthy 11-year-old girl was presented to the National University of Malaysia (UKM) Paediatric Dental Clinic with a referral for further management of pulp necrosis of an immature lower right second premolar (tooth 45), secondary to the fractured tubercle of dens evaginatus. Two weeks earlier, she had treatment at a general dental clinic for pain related to tooth 45. Tooth 45 had spontaneous and lingering pain following cold and thermal stimuli. The tooth was diagnosed to have symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, and root canal therapy was initiated. The canal was accessed, and pulp extirpation performed before the placement of intracanal nonsetting calcium hydroxide by the general dental practitioner (GDP).\nAt the time of current assessment, her tooth-related symptoms had completely resolved. General oral examination showed the presence of generalised mild gingivitis with a basic periodontal examination (BPE) score of 1 in all sextants. The patient's oral hygiene was fair with a plaque score of 30%. The patient is still in her mixed dentition with the presence of the primary maxillary canines. Her upper dental arch was well aligned, and mild crowding of anterior teeth was noted in the lower arch. Tooth 45 has an occlusal glass ionomer dressing of the access cavity made for the pulp extirpation earlier by the GDP (). Cold and electric pulp sensibility testings showed positive responses to all fully erupted premolars indicative of tooth vitality expect for tooth 45. Tooth 45 also has slight tenderness to percussion. Periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an immature root with convergent open apex and small periapical radiolucency. The pulp space of tooth 45 is of an even width from the coronal to the apical portion (). Based on the assessments, tooth 45 was diagnosed with pulp necrosis secondary to fractured dens evaginatus and symptomatic apical periodontitis.\nOn the day of initial assessment, tooth 45 was isolated with rubber dam after infiltration of local anaesthetic solution (2% lidocaine with 1 : 80000 adrenaline). Pulp chamber was reentered through the previously prepared access cavity. The root canal was exposed and irrigated with saline. After that, the canal was dried with paper points and the tooth working length was estimated with a K-file No. 60. A working length, 2 mm short of the apical opening, was determined (17 mm). The canal was gently prepared with the K-file No. 60 and then irrigated with a copious volume of 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI). After drying the wet canal with paper points, nonsetting calcium hydroxide was placed into the canal and the access cavity was double sealed with Cavit\u2122 3M, USA, and glass ionomer cement (GIC) (Riva Self Cure\u2122 SDI, Australia).\nTwo weeks later, the tooth was reassessed for any signs and symptoms of infection. The tooth was no longer tender to percussion, and there was no indication of infection-related signs and symptoms. After isolation with a rubber dam, the root canal of tooth 45 was reaccessed and irrigated with a copious volume 1.5% NaOCl to remove the nonsetting calcium hydroxide. Then, the canal was irrigated with sterile water and dried with paper points. Subsequently, the canal was irrigated with 17% EDTA (Pulpdent\u2122, Watertown, Massachusetts) for a minute and dried with paper points. Finally, under the guidance of a dental operating microscope (Carl Zeiss Surgical GmbH, S100), the apical region was filled using the EndoSequence (BC RRM-Fast Set Putty, Brasseler, USA) material up to 4 mm thickness to create an apical seal (). The orifice of the root canal was double sealed with a cotton pellet, temporary filling material (Cavit 3M, USA), and GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia).\nOnce again, the root canal was reaccessed two weeks later, irrigated with 1.5% NaOCl, and dried with paper points. Next, the dried canal was obturated with thermoplasticised gutta-perca using the Obtura III Max System (Obtura Spartan\u00ae Endodontics) ().

Two weeks earlier, she had treatment at a general dental clinic for pain related to tooth 45. Tooth 45 had spontaneous and lingering pain following cold and thermal stimuli. The tooth was diagnosed to have symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, and root canal therapy was initiated. The canal was accessed, and pulp extirpation performed before the placement of intracanal nonsetting calcium hydroxide by the general dental practitioner (GDP).\nAt the time of current assessment, her tooth-related symptoms had completely resolved. General oral examination showed the presence of generalised mild gingivitis with a basic periodontal examination (BPE) score of 1 in all sextants. The patient's oral hygiene was fair with a plaque score of 30%. The patient is still in her mixed dentition with the presence of the primary maxillary canines. Her upper dental arch was well aligned, and mild crowding of anterior teeth was noted in the lower arch. Tooth 45 has an occlusal glass ionomer dressing of the access cavity made for the pulp extirpation earlier by the GDP (). Cold and electric pulp sensibility testings showed positive responses to all fully erupted premolars indicative of tooth vitality expect for tooth 45. Tooth 45 also has slight tenderness to percussion. Periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an immature root with convergent open apex and small periapical radiolucency. The pulp space of tooth 45 is of an even width from the coronal to the apical portion (). Based on the assessments, tooth 45 was diagnosed with pulp necrosis secondary to fractured dens evaginatus and symptomatic apical periodontitis.\nOn the day of initial assessment, tooth 45 was isolated with rubber dam after infiltration of local anaesthetic solution (2% lidocaine with 1 : 80000 adrenaline). Pulp chamber was reentered through the previously prepared access cavity. The root canal was exposed and irrigated with saline. After that, the canal was dried with paper points and the tooth working length was estimated with a K-file No. 60. A working length, 2 mm short of the apical opening, was determined (17 mm). The canal was gently prepared with the K-file No. 60 and then irrigated with a copious volume of 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI). After drying the wet canal with paper points, nonsetting calcium hydroxide was placed into the canal and the access cavity was double sealed with Cavit\u2122 3M, USA, and glass ionomer cement (GIC) (Riva Self Cure\u2122 SDI, Australia).\nTwo weeks later, the tooth was reassessed for any signs and symptoms of infection. The tooth was no longer tender to percussion, and there was no indication of infection-related signs and symptoms. After isolation with a rubber dam, the root canal of tooth 45 was reaccessed and irrigated with a copious volume 1.5% NaOCl to remove the nonsetting calcium hydroxide. Then, the canal was irrigated with sterile water and dried with paper points. Subsequently, the canal was irrigated with 17% EDTA (Pulpdent\u2122, Watertown, Massachusetts) for a minute and dried with paper points. Finally, under the guidance of a dental operating microscope (Carl Zeiss Surgical GmbH, S100), the apical region was filled using the EndoSequence (BC RRM-Fast Set Putty, Brasseler, USA) material up to 4 mm thickness to create an apical seal (). The orifice of the root canal was double sealed with a cotton pellet, temporary filling material (Cavit 3M, USA), and GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia).\nOnce again, the root canal was reaccessed two weeks later, irrigated with 1.5% NaOCl, and dried with paper points. Next, the dried canal was obturated with thermoplasticised gutta-perca using the Obtura III Max System (Obtura Spartan\u00ae Endodontics) (). After that, the access cavity was double sealed with GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia) and nanohybrid composite (AURA\u2122 SDI, Australia), respectively.\nFollowing the obturation, tooth 45 was reviewed at three-month and six-month intervals. During both reviews, tooth 45 was asymptomatic. However, at the six-month review, a periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an unexpected finding. The apical root of tooth 45 continued to grow beyond the apexification level with a normal periodontal ligament space and lamina dura. No evidence of periapical radiolucency was noted ().

Pulp necrosis is a condition in which the pulp, the living tissue within a tooth, dies due to interruption of blood supply often caused by trauma or severe decay. Nonsetting calcium hydroxide is commonly used in root canal therapy as an intracanal medicament due to its antimicrobial properties and capacity to facilitate the formation of mineralized tissue. It helps in neutralizing the acidic environment, encouraging repair, and preventing further bacterial invasion. Therefore, nonsetting calcium hydroxide is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this case scenario.\n\nOther options such as amoxicillin, an antibiotic, might be used if there was a systemic infection or abscess formation, which is not indicated in this case. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that can relieve pain but does not address the cause of pulp necrosis. Fluoride varnish and silver diamine fluoride are used primarily to prevent or arrest caries but not for treating pulp necrosis.

{"clinical_note": "A healthy 11-year-old girl was presented to the National University of Malaysia (UKM) Paediatric Dental Clinic with a referral for further management of pulp necrosis of an immature lower right second premolar (tooth 45), secondary to the fractured tubercle of dens evaginatus. Two weeks earlier, she had treatment at a general dental clinic for pain related to tooth 45. Tooth 45 had spontaneous and lingering pain following cold and thermal stimuli. The tooth was diagnosed to have symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, and root canal therapy was initiated. The canal was accessed, and pulp extirpation performed before the placement of intracanal nonsetting calcium hydroxide by the general dental practitioner (GDP).\nAt the time of current assessment, her tooth-related symptoms had completely resolved. General oral examination showed the presence of generalised mild gingivitis with a basic periodontal examination (BPE) score of 1 in all sextants. The patient's oral hygiene was fair with a plaque score of 30%. The patient is still in her mixed dentition with the presence of the primary maxillary canines. Her upper dental arch was well aligned, and mild crowding of anterior teeth was noted in the lower arch. Tooth 45 has an occlusal glass ionomer dressing of the access cavity made for the pulp extirpation earlier by the GDP (). Cold and electric pulp sensibility testings showed positive responses to all fully erupted premolars indicative of tooth vitality expect for tooth 45. Tooth 45 also has slight tenderness to percussion. Periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an immature root with convergent open apex and small periapical radiolucency. The pulp space of tooth 45 is of an even width from the coronal to the apical portion (). Based on the assessments, tooth 45 was diagnosed with pulp necrosis secondary to fractured dens evaginatus and symptomatic apical periodontitis.\nOn the day of initial assessment, tooth 45 was isolated with rubber dam after infiltration of local anaesthetic solution (2% lidocaine with 1 : 80000 adrenaline). Pulp chamber was reentered through the previously prepared access cavity. The root canal was exposed and irrigated with saline. After that, the canal was dried with paper points and the tooth working length was estimated with a K-file No. 60. A working length, 2 mm short of the apical opening, was determined (17 mm). The canal was gently prepared with the K-file No. 60 and then irrigated with a copious volume of 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI). After drying the wet canal with paper points, nonsetting calcium hydroxide was placed into the canal and the access cavity was double sealed with Cavit\u2122 3M, USA, and glass ionomer cement (GIC) (Riva Self Cure\u2122 SDI, Australia).\nTwo weeks later, the tooth was reassessed for any signs and symptoms of infection. The tooth was no longer tender to percussion, and there was no indication of infection-related signs and symptoms. After isolation with a rubber dam, the root canal of tooth 45 was reaccessed and irrigated with a copious volume 1.5% NaOCl to remove the nonsetting calcium hydroxide. Then, the canal was irrigated with sterile water and dried with paper points. Subsequently, the canal was irrigated with 17% EDTA (Pulpdent\u2122, Watertown, Massachusetts) for a minute and dried with paper points. Finally, under the guidance of a dental operating microscope (Carl Zeiss Surgical GmbH, S100), the apical region was filled using the EndoSequence (BC RRM-Fast Set Putty, Brasseler, USA) material up to 4 mm thickness to create an apical seal (). The orifice of the root canal was double sealed with a cotton pellet, temporary filling material (Cavit 3M, USA), and GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia).\nOnce again, the root canal was reaccessed two weeks later, irrigated with 1.5% NaOCl, and dried with paper points. Next, the dried canal was obturated with thermoplasticised gutta-perca using the Obtura III Max System (Obtura Spartan\u00ae Endodontics) (). After that, the access cavity was double sealed with GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia) and nanohybrid composite (AURA\u2122 SDI, Australia), respectively.\nFollowing the obturation, tooth 45 was reviewed at three-month and six-month intervals. During both reviews, tooth 45 was asymptomatic. However, at the six-month review, a periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an unexpected finding. The apical root of tooth 45 continued to grow beyond the apexification level with a normal periodontal ligament space and lamina dura. No evidence of periapical radiolucency was noted (). However, regular annual monitoring of tooth 45 is essential to ensure that the coronal seal is intact and no apical complication further arises.", "keypoint": "root canal therapy for pulp necrosis in pediatric patients", "topic": "appropriate surgical management", "content_to_fb": "Some error occured: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'"}

The fever was intermittent and worse in the evenings, and associated with headache, joint pains, and anorexia. He self-medicated an undocumented orally administered antimalarial medication but symptoms persisted. Three days later, he developed generalized abdominal pain, colicky in character, with a severity of 5/10 on a visual analogue scale. This was associated with progressive abdominal distension and an altered bowel pattern initially characterized by an inability to pass stool and flatus over 4 days but he denied any vomiting. A worsening of his symptoms prompted his visit to our hospital.\nOn examination, his mucous membranes were dry, his conjunctivae were pink, and his vital signs were normal. His abdomen was mildly distended with mild diffuse tenderness. There was neither guarding nor rebound tenderness. Percussion note was tympanic and bowel sounds were hyperactive. His rectum was empty per digital rectal examination and his prostate was not enlarged. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nA rapid diagnostic (Alere\u2122 Malaria Ag P.f, Abbott Rapid Diagnostics, USA) test for malaria was positive. Also, his complete blood count values were within normal ranges: white blood cell count of 6200 cells/uL, hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 222,000 cells/uL. His metabolic panel was within normal range: serum sodium ion (Na+) of 140 mmol/L, serum potassium ion (K+) of 4.0 mmol/L, serum chloride ion (Cl\u2212) of 98 mmol/L, serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase was 41.2 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase was 33.0 U/L, total bilirubin was 0.81 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase was 55.9 U/L.

He self-medicated an undocumented orally administered antimalarial medication but symptoms persisted. Three days later, he developed generalized abdominal pain, colicky in character, with a severity of 5/10 on a visual analogue scale. This was associated with progressive abdominal distension and an altered bowel pattern initially characterized by an inability to pass stool and flatus over 4 days but he denied any vomiting. A worsening of his symptoms prompted his visit to our hospital.\nOn examination, his mucous membranes were dry, his conjunctivae were pink, and his vital signs were normal. His abdomen was mildly distended with mild diffuse tenderness. There was neither guarding nor rebound tenderness. Percussion note was tympanic and bowel sounds were hyperactive. His rectum was empty per digital rectal examination and his prostate was not enlarged. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nA rapid diagnostic (Alere\u2122 Malaria Ag P.f, Abbott Rapid Diagnostics, USA) test for malaria was positive. Also, his complete blood count values were within normal ranges: white blood cell count of 6200 cells/uL, hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 222,000 cells/uL. His metabolic panel was within normal range: serum sodium ion (Na+) of 140 mmol/L, serum potassium ion (K+) of 4.0 mmol/L, serum chloride ion (Cl\u2212) of 98 mmol/L, serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase was 41.2 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase was 33.0 U/L, total bilirubin was 0.81 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase was 55.9 U/L. His human immunodeficiency virus serology was non-reactive. His rapid antibody test for typhoid fever was also non-reactive. There was no significant air fluid level or increased bowel gas on a plain abdominal radiograph and an abdominal ultrasound revealed mild free intra-abdominal fluid in all four quadrants.\nWe concluded on a working diagnosis of functional bowel obstruction secondary to malaria.

{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 65-year-old man with a prior history of repeated plastic surgery for scar contracture of the hands and fingers, ablation surgery for idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, and diabetes. There was no family history of no consanguineous marriage or EB.\nHe had experienced recurrent blistering of the skin that was readily caused by an external force since the time shortly after birth, which had been treated symptomatically. He was diagnosed with EB during a genetic consultation that he had received before getting married at the age of 28 years. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with RDEB at the age of 38 years. Application of a strong external force to the skin results in blister formation as early as 15 min. In June 2012, he presented to a nearby hospital with epigastric pain, where he was diagnosed with cholelithiasis and cancer in the transverse colon and was referred to our hospital. In September 2012, transverse colectomy and cholecystectomy were performed via laparotomy, followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In April 2013, a liver metastasis (S2) was detected. The lesion was a solitary tumor measuring \u22642 cm and was treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in June 2013, again followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In September 2015, a recurrent tumor was detected at the site of RFA, with suspected invasion into the diaphragm. He was then admitted to our hospital for curative open surgery. On admission, although no active blistering was noted, pigmentation and scars due to recurrent blistering were noted especially in the extremities and back. Most fingers in both hands were club-shaped, with a few intact fingers. Blood test showed a mild increase in glucose to 123 mg/dl and increases in tumor markers, including mean levels of CEA and CA19-9 of 25.0 (0\u20135) ng/ml and 62.1 (0\u201337) U/ml, respectively.\nAbdominal CT/MRI revealed a 3.5 cm metastatic liver carcinoma with diaphragmatic invasion in the lateral segment of the liver. In January 8, 2016, open partial hepatectomy of the lateral segment with combined diaphragmatic resection was performed.\nThe patient was asked to climb on the operating table on his own to minimize application of an external force to the skin. Epidural anesthesia was achieved by just one injection of 5 ml of 0.5% procaine into the epidural space. For endotracheal intubation, due to a difficulty in manually fixing a mask and lifting the lower jaw, the patient was asked to open his mouth and intubation was performed while the patient was conscious using intravenous injection of 1% propofol and intratracheal spraying of 1% xylocaine, under bronchoscopic guidance using a McGRATH\u2122 MAC video laryngoscope (Covidien). Isodine disinfectant was used for skin disinfection of the surgical site, as the patient was tolerant of chemical stimulations. A skin incision was made sharply with a scalpel, with particular care taken to avoid contact of a steel instrument with the skin. Partial hepatectomy of the lateral segment with combined diaphragmatic resection was performed. The diaphragmatic defect was closed with a 2-0 nonabsorbable suture while the lung was compressed, without chest tube placement. A 19 Fr closed low-pressure continuous-suction drain was placed on the liver resection surface. A block catheter was also placed on the bilateral rectus sheaths in case of postoperative wound pain. The wound was closed by two-layer suturing with a 0 monofilament absorbable suture for the peritoneal muscle layer and a 4-0 monofilament absorbable suture for dermal closure. The wound was covered with a Mepilex\u00ae Border Ag dressing (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care). The drain was fixed with a needle and a suture and then with a Mepitac\u00ae tape (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care). The operative and anesthetic times were 346 and 457 min, respectively.\nThe patient was discharged from the hospital on day 9.

{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 65-year-old man with a prior history of repeated plastic surgery for scar contracture of the hands and fingers, ablation surgery for idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, and diabetes. There was no family history of no consanguineous marriage or EB.\nHe had experienced recurrent blistering of the skin that was readily caused by an external force since the time shortly after birth, which had been treated symptomatically. He was diagnosed with EB during a genetic consultation that he had received before getting married at the age of 28 years. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with RDEB at the age of 38 years. Application of a strong external force to the skin results in blister formation as early as 15 min. In June 2012, he presented to a nearby hospital with epigastric pain, where he was diagnosed with cholelithiasis and cancer in the transverse colon and was referred to our hospital. In September 2012, transverse colectomy and cholecystectomy were performed via laparotomy, followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In April 2013, a liver metastasis (S2) was detected. The lesion was a solitary tumor measuring \u22642 cm and was treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in June 2013, again followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In September 2015, a recurrent tumor was detected at the site of RFA, with suspected invasion into the diaphragm. He was then admitted to our hospital for curative open surgery. On admission, although no active blistering was noted, pigmentation and scars due to recurrent blistering were noted especially in the extremities and back. Most fingers in both hands were club-shaped, with a few intact fingers. Blood test showed a mild increase in glucose to 123 mg/dl and increases in tumor markers, including mean levels of CEA and CA19-9 of 25.0 (0\u20135) ng/ml and 62.1 (0\u201337) U/ml, respectively.\nAbdominal CT/MRI revealed a 3.5 cm metastatic liver carcinoma with diaphragmatic invasion in the lateral segment of the liver. In January 8, 2016, open partial hepatectomy of the lateral segment with combined diaphragmatic resection was performed.\nThe patient was asked to climb on the operating table on his own to minimize application of an external force to the skin. Epidural anesthesia was achieved by just one injection of 5 ml of 0.5% procaine into the epidural space. For endotracheal intubation, due to a difficulty in manually fixing a mask and lifting the lower jaw, the patient was asked to open his mouth and intubation was performed while the patient was conscious using intravenous injection of 1% propofol and intratracheal spraying of 1% xylocaine, under bronchoscopic guidance using a McGRATH\u2122 MAC video laryngoscope (Covidien). Isodine disinfectant was used for skin disinfection of the surgical site, as the patient was tolerant of chemical stimulations. A skin incision was made sharply with a scalpel, with particular care taken to avoid contact of a steel instrument with the skin. Partial hepatectomy of the lateral segment with combined diaphragmatic resection was performed. The diaphragmatic defect was closed with a 2-0 nonabsorbable suture while the lung was compressed, without chest tube placement. A 19 Fr closed low-pressure continuous-suction drain was placed on the liver resection surface. A block catheter was also placed on the bilateral rectus sheaths in case of postoperative wound pain. The wound was closed by two-layer suturing with a 0 monofilament absorbable suture for the peritoneal muscle layer and a 4-0 monofilament absorbable suture for dermal closure. The wound was covered with a Mepilex\u00ae Border Ag dressing (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care). The drain was fixed with a needle and a suture and then with a Mepitac\u00ae tape (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care). The operative and anesthetic times were 346 and 457 min, respectively.\nThe patient was discharged from the hospital on day 9.

{"clinical_note": "The patient was a 65-year-old man with a prior history of repeated plastic surgery for scar contracture of the hands and fingers, ablation surgery for idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, and diabetes. There was no family history of no consanguineous marriage or EB.\nHe had experienced recurrent blistering of the skin that was readily caused by an external force since the time shortly after birth, which had been treated symptomatically. He was diagnosed with EB during a genetic consultation that he had received before getting married at the age of 28 years. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with RDEB at the age of 38 years. Application of a strong external force to the skin results in blister formation as early as 15 min. In June 2012, he presented to a nearby hospital with epigastric pain, where he was diagnosed with cholelithiasis and cancer in the transverse colon and was referred to our hospital. In September 2012, transverse colectomy and cholecystectomy were performed via laparotomy, followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In April 2013, a liver metastasis (S2) was detected. The lesion was a solitary tumor measuring \u22642 cm and was treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in June 2013, again followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In September 2015, a recurrent tumor was detected at the site of RFA, with suspected invasion into the diaphragm. He was then admitted to our hospital for curative open surgery. On admission, although no active blistering was noted, pigmentation and scars due to recurrent blistering were noted especially in the extremities and back. Most fingers in both hands were club-shaped, with a few intact fingers. Blood test showed a mild increase in glucose to 123 mg/dl and increases in tumor markers, including mean levels of CEA and CA19-9 of 25.0 (0\u20135) ng/ml and 62.1 (0\u201337) U/ml, respectively.\nAbdominal CT/MRI revealed a 3.5 cm metastatic liver carcinoma with diaphragmatic invasion in the lateral segment of the liver. In January 8, 2016, open partial hepatectomy of the lateral segment with combined diaphragmatic resection was performed.\nThe patient was asked to climb on the operating table on his own to minimize application of an external force to the skin. Epidural anesthesia was achieved by just one injection of 5 ml of 0.5% procaine into the epidural space. For endotracheal intubation, due to a difficulty in manually fixing a mask and lifting the lower jaw, the patient was asked to open his mouth and intubation was performed while the patient was conscious using intravenous injection of 1% propofol and intratracheal spraying of 1% xylocaine, under bronchoscopic guidance using a McGRATH\u2122 MAC video laryngoscope (Covidien). Isodine disinfectant was used for skin disinfection of the surgical site, as the patient was tolerant of chemical stimulations. A skin incision was made sharply with a scalpel, with particular care taken to avoid contact of a steel instrument with the skin. Partial hepatectomy of the lateral segment with combined diaphragmatic resection was performed. The diaphragmatic defect was closed with a 2-0 nonabsorbable suture while the lung was compressed, without chest tube placement. A 19 Fr closed low-pressure continuous-suction drain was placed on the liver resection surface. A block catheter was also placed on the bilateral rectus sheaths in case of postoperative wound pain. The wound was closed by two-layer suturing with a 0 monofilament absorbable suture for the peritoneal muscle layer and a 4-0 monofilament absorbable suture for dermal closure. The wound was covered with a Mepilex\u00ae Border Ag dressing (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care). The drain was fixed with a needle and a suture and then with a Mepitac\u00ae tape (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care). The operative and anesthetic times were 346 and 457 min, respectively.\nThe patient was discharged from the hospital on day 9.

RDEB is characterized by chronic blistering, scarring, and contractures of the skin, leading to limited mobility and function of the hands and fingers, as seen in the patient's history of numerous plastic surgeries for scar contractures.\n\nFurthermore, the patient's recent findings include a 3.5 cm metastatic liver carcinoma with diaphragmatic invasion and elevated tumor markers. Individuals with RDEB are at an increased risk for developing squamous cell carcinoma, which can metastasize to other parts of the body, including the liver.\n\nTherefore, given the patient's history of RDEB and recent diagnosis of metastatic liver carcinoma, the most probable diagnosis is Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) with metastatic liver carcinoma. The other options, such as Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (JEB), Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS), and Dominant Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DDEB), can be ruled out based on the patient's previous diagnosis and the absence of their specific symptoms in the patient's medical history.
